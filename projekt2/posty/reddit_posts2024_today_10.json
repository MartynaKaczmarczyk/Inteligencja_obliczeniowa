That part *works*, and should probably be the cut-to-credits moment. But I would've needed so much more if I was as invested as I was at launch.\n\nI know the third act of Witcher 3 largely exists to close off Act 2. After the game's preambles you're set free in Velen, Novigrad and Skellige, and resolve the \"Find Ciri\" subplot which eventually becomes the respective \"Bloody Baron\", \"Dandelion\" and \"An Crache\" subplots. So in Act 3, although you think the plot is still developing you're really just revisiting each previous location to see how your storyline turned out for each part, and also provide some last choices to determine things like the Radovid/Emhyr plot, and the main story is there to build up your relationship to Ciri into the climax. I get all of that.\n\nBut given the climax, where the world is about to be torn asunder, Yennefer practically gets seperated from you as you head to Avellac'h, the first things that raced through my mind when I saw \"2 weeks later\" appear was Ciri but after that it was \"What about Dandelion, what about Yennefer, what about him or her?\"\n\nAnd in the end they only use the epilogue to address Ciri herself. The Empress ending is ironically more satisfying because Yennefer will appear in it, so for a Yen playthrough you feel reaffirmed that she's by your side. The Epilogue-Slideshow will also tell you everything, of course, but that's not actually that satisfying.\n\n**TL;DR:** Even 9 years later, I still don't think the endings of Witcher 3 are all that good. I think a lot of it works on paper but the execution is very disappointing, after so much greatness.\n\nPS: The GOOD part is that I will now play Blood & Wine for ***the very first time***."

Imagine my surprise when I heard that she goes through much worse in the book series.\n\nI gave the books a read and found myself particularly disturbed by the relationship between Ciri and Mistle that was a result of sexual assault (as explained in the book). There are numerous points to go on about how it was not seen as a positive thing.\n\n1. Ciri going to the river afterwards crying and desperately trying to wash herself.\n\n2. Geralt having a vision of Ciri with Mistle and immediately frowning as he knew something was very wrong.\n\n3. Ciri not wanting Mistle to touch her anymore and admitting the only reason she stays with her is because she doesn\u2019t want to be left alone.\n\nBasically the relationship was a case of Stockholm Syndrome, which by definition \u2018describes the psychological condition of a victim who identifies with and empathizes with their captor or abuser and their goal.\u2019\n\nAll in all, the relationship in no way should be celebrated and yet I often times find so many people explaining with glee how Ciri was in a relationship with this woman, and how they even got matching tattoos while getting intoxicated by Fisstech (drugs). Often times, I can\u2019t help but find this completely disturbing that such a relationship would be viewed in a positive light.\n\nAnd even worse of the option in the Witcher 3 game where you can choose to have Ciri talk about the rose tattoo on her thigh in a positive light. I do know for certain I make sure to choose the opposite option of having Ciri admit she was simply young and dumb, and that it was not right to be involved in such things.\n\nAll in all, I do wonder if anyone else feels disturbed when seeing people talk about the Ciri/Mistlle relationship with pride or on a positive note."

        "body": "Another Witcher book and another set of reflections. This time again I'll comment on some fragments of the novel in a non-comprehensive manner because I think it's very fitting (and at the end, I'll explain why) and then I'll summarise the book as a whole.\n\n\"The Blood of Elves\" starts with a scene where a crowd listens to one of Dandelion's songs about Geralt and then engages in a discussion first about witcher and then about politics. Sapkowski does several things in this scene and I couldn't help but be stunned by how well he did it. He introduces the main characters of the story, paints the society with all the divisions between certain groups, and explains the most recent political history of the region and much more distant history. Only at the end of the scene, I realised that what I read is one gigantic infodump, but it's conveyed so well, it doesn't feel like an infodump at all. Another thing I've noticed now but didn't see in the past is that Sapkowski started his meditation on myth creation already here not in the last book of the series. Some people claim that Geralt is made up of characters others that he died or that he's never found Ciri, yet all of them are his contemporaries. And already there are several versions of the events. This shows how easily myth separates from history.\n\nLater on, we observe Ciri's training under witchers in Kaer Morhen. I like two things about this section of the novel. First is how Ciri confessed to Triss about her period and how Triss scolded the witchers for lack of imagination and consideration. It's something so natural in this context that's great that Sapkowski put it in the novel. Ciri's reactions are so child-like, she's probably one of the best-written children that I found in literature. And it's not surprising that witchers didn\u2019t think about Ciri's physiology because their interactions with women are usually very short and very intense without any space for deeper conversations. And besides the whole sequence is hilarious.\n\nAnother fragment I want to highlight is a set of scenes where Ciri trains under witchers and Triss. They're pure dialogue without even one sentence of description of what characters do, how they behave, whether are they annoyed or not, etc, yet there's no problem imagining how everything plays out, and dialogues are very natural. It's a sign of true mastery of the craft.\n\nLater on Geralt, Triss and Ciri leave Kaer Morhen to deliver Ciri to Melitele temple. They soon join a company of dwarves led by Yarpen Zigrin who are escorting important delivery. This section of the novel Sapkowski uses to paint complex social interactions between humans and non-humans and within non-humans as well as many flavors of racism (or ethnic discrimination, because I'm not sure if it can be called racism, later on, I explain why I think so). Nilfgaard incites non-humans to rebel against northern kingdoms. While non-humans in Nilfgaards have full rights, empire actions are not selfless. It uses non-humans as a tool to stir chaos in the north. In my opinion, it's a very cynical example of racism. Nilfgaard, despite its laws, views non-humans not as equals but as disposable tools. Non-humans themselves aren't a homogenous group. They disagree on how they should interact with humans. People like Yarpen believe that only through genuine devotion they will be able to gain full rights and respect for humans. The Squirrels think that they have to fight for it, and everyone who disagrees with them has to die. Geralt on the other hand believes that taking sides is the problem because by rebelling against the overwhelming number of humans elves will lose their most precious resource - their young ones and as a consequence the future of their kind. Readers observe this Gordian knot through Ciri's eyes, who, as a child, sees everyone as a friend and can't understand where is the problem. Because there isn't any real problem only prejudice and malice that tainted the minds of adults and led to horrible things in the past. The chapter and with a battle between Squirrels and the convoy, where a lot of non-humans die, and it's revealed that the \"important\" delivery was just a set-up to test Yarpen's loyalty because he's non-human and cannot be fully trusted. And since the majority of his company consists of dwarves, it wouldn't be a big loss if they died during battle. Another flavor of racism.\n\nI spent so much space to describe this fragment because it strays away from the usual depiction of racism in culture and there's good reason for that. Sapkowski again draws from polish history, especially the WW2 period. Nilfgaard inciting non-humans against humans reminds me of nazis doing the same with Ukrainians setting them up against Poles. It led to the terrifying slaughter of Poles by their ukrainian neighbours. This event is still an inflamed wound that taints polish-ukrainian relationships. Poland insists that it was genocide while Ukraine doesn't want to admit any wrongdoing. Now, I don't want to paint Ukrainians as villains. The resentment they had for Poles didn\u2019t come from nowhere. In previous centuries polish nobility were treating ukrainian peasants horribly. Polish noble was \"pan\" - the lord. The problem is that polish nobles treated polish peasants equally badly and the victims of the slaughter were descendants of those peasants, not polish lords. But this is typical of any ethnic cleansing - victims were never responsible for what they were killed. The way Yarpen wants to prove his loyalty to humans and how suspicious they are reminds me of Jews trying to do the same in Poland in the years leading to the war. Yeah, you speak Polish, dress polish, and you're even baptised and attend Sunday's mass in church with us, but you're not *really* polish. And it wasn't only a jewish experience. I can imagine that many nations can relate to that. Finally, Geralt's perspective on the pointlessness of elven young rebelling reminds me of the Warsaw uprising during WW2. The point of the uprising was to liberate Warsaw from nazis by Poles themselves before the Soviets came, so when they eventually did Poles could greet them as equal allies, not liberators. Leaders of the uprising were hoping this move would secure polish independence from the USSR. But it was an idiotic fantasy. The fate of Poland was decided elsewhere and the uprising led only to the decimation of polish youth. The whole generation was lost and Warsaw was leveled to the ground. A lot of people (myself included) consider the Warsaw uprising a war crime, but not committed by nazis but by the leaders of the uprising. It's not a super-popular perspective. Warsaw's uprising is still treated as a heroic act and few remaining veterans as heroes. Sapkowski could choose this perspective as an inspiration for Geralt's worldview but he opted for something much more tragic.\n\nOk, I'm done with this lengthy (and probably boring) history lecture, but before I go further, I just want to explain why I wrote it in the first place. While I disagree with the people who think The Witcher series is Slavic, it's definitely polish as hell. In my opinion, Sapkowski translated parts of polish history into fantasy really well, so my historical lecture isn't necessary to understand the events of the novel, but it may help to understand why Sapkowski wrote them this way. Non-humans call discrimination they experience from human racism, but it is based on different types of ethnic discrimination that English readers might not be familiar with due to different cultural and historical backgrounds. It might be confusing for them why Squirrels are depicted as morally grey at best, why their fight is pointless and tragic, and why some groups of non-humans decided to stand with humans. Well, this is why. Sapkowski could obviously try to please polish readers by using a more cheerful view of polish history to construct his world, where Poles were always noble purely innocent victims etc, but he chose a much more complex and darker version. And I admire him for that.\n\nMoving on. The letter Yennefer sent to Geralt is pure gold. It's soaked in venom so toxic, it would be enough to kill a middle-sized town. You don't call Yennefer \"friend\" not after being with her. It's almost a life sentence.\n\nDuring Dandelion's adventures in Oxenfurt, he briefly mentions the \"bench ghetto\" at the university. This is another reference to polish history, where during the pre-WW2 era Jews had to sit in designated areas of a room during classes. It's a symbol of polish antisemitism of that time, sort of similar to segregation in buses in the US during the 50s.\n\nLater on, Sapkowski presents the gathering of nordic monarchs, who were debating on possible war with Nilfgaard. It's another great scene because from the start Sapkowski emphasises the fact that there's no good side in the upcoming war. Kings treat Cirtians as pawns and don't care about their fate at all and decide to slaughter all non-humans in ghettos to prevent them from getting \"funny ideas\", which is another type of racism. Foltest claims to be tolerant and empathetic towards non-humans, but. Yeah, there's always some kind of \"but\". Yet again, it isn't the purely ideological type of racism, but, I don't know, practical I guess? Foltest wants to get rid of the problem before it even appears, sort of like we are decimating mosquitoes to prevent the spread of malaria. Non-humans are not beings in their own right, but problems that need solutions. It's dehumanising.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of the novel, where Ciri meets Yennefer for the first time. I really like that they start as sort of rivals for Geralt's attention. Even if they weren't aware of that Nenneke diagnosed their dynamic correctly, which probably helped them get along with each other much faster. Their relationship is initially cold but slowly gains some tenderness and peaks when Yennefer calls Ciri's daughter after a failed lesson. I don't know why, but these moments of kindness towards Ciri always get me. They get me hard. I don't know if it's because of nostalgia for the series or simply because it's so damn good.\n\nOk, I'm done with my impressions, now it's time for a summary. After so many praises I've written above, one may think that \"The Blood of Elves\" is a masterpiece. Everything is superb: writing, dialogues, characters, and themes, but the question is: \"Is it a great novel?\" Well, I have mixed feelings about it, let me explain, why. Initially, I wrote that discussing separate fragments of the books seems fitting. It's because \"The Blood of Elves\" works at the level of fragments and chapters, but it doesn't work as a novel.\u00a0\n\nIt starts well. The reader has a sense of direction: Geralt brings Ciri to Kaer Morhen, trains her, lets Triss examine her, and finally decides to bring her to Melitele temple. Chapter 4 ends when the protagonists are in the middle of the road to the temple and suddenly in chapter 5 Geralt is on a boat setting a trap for people who look for him and Ciri. What? How? From the first chapter we know that Rience is after Ciri and finding him would be the natural direction for the novel after Geralt leaves Ciri with Nenneke. The problem is, that Sapkowski cut the whole chunk of the novel. Or at least he concluded that he had nothing interesting to write about this part of the journey. But because of that the rest of the novel also falls apart. The scene on the boat is entertaining enough due to Sapkowski's humor and mastery in writing dialogues but ultimately feels redundant. The only point of it is for Geralt to catch a trail, which he thinks he does with Temeria thugs. But during a conversation between Dijkstra and Jaskier, the master of spies reiterates the scene and gives additional, much more relevant context. So the scene of the boat could be cut completely. Later on, we get a bunch of scenes when big players of the world are discussing politics. For me, at least, those scenes were interesting and necessary for the plot, but they also cover the fact that Sapkowski wrote only a few more pages in the main plotline. And then we get the chapter with Ciri and Yennefer, which is great on its own, but it isn't connected to the rest of the novel. It's called a chapter, not an epilogue so it should be an integral part of the story. But I don't see the reason why (actually I see and explain in a moment) it couldn't be the first chapter of the next novel. It would fit them perfectly.\n\nNow, I don't want to sound like \"The Blood of Elves\" and huge step back from the short stories. There's a lot of good here. Sapkowski grew as a writer and the prose in his first novel surpasses even the best pieces from short stories. He utilizes several writing styles, especially in those fragments of fictional books at the beginning of each chapter and in dialogues to give each character a distinct way of speaking (I wonder if the translation gives him justice). The novel as a whole works well as an introduction for the saga - it presents the first pieces of lore, sets up pawns on the political board, and most importantly serves as a reminder of the good times for Ciri and readers as well, when all hell is let loose in next parts. I think, Ciri here builds core memories of the last time when she felt safe and loved and was just a child. And that's why the last chapter also fits here (loosely but still) not in the next novel: as chapters with other witchers help Ciri to develop good memories.\n\nSo, is it a good novel? Depends on reader preferences, I guess. I can totally understand people who\u2019d complain about the structure of the book, but for me, there\u2019s so much good stuff inside that I couldn\u2019t care less. But, obviously, it\u2019s a very subjective opinion.\n\nOk, I think it's more than enough writing. Sorry for such a long post. I hope someone will read it and find it at least mildly interesting. And I'd be happy to hear your opinion on The Witcher series."

So he knew that she withheld information at least initially. However it's implied that they mutually agreed to break up so he could search for Yennefer which brings me to my point. \n\nIn the 3rd game there is the following dialogue:\n\nGeralt- I've recovered my memory completely. \n\nTriss - good, that'll stop people taking advantage of you. \n\nGeralt--someones been taking advantage of me? \n\nTriss - I have for one. \n\nGeralt - I never even intimated--\n\nIt's this last line that always confused me. How do you guys interpret it? I see it as he doesn't agree that triss took advantage of him. Which sounds like what happened in the books where she seduced him and he wasn't angry and didn't regret it. \nWhat do you think? I think it adds a very interesting dynamic to the whole situation "

When I went to Novigrad to help Triss eliminate the rats, it suddenly lit up.\n\nWhat is the White Wolf in Triss's eyes?\n\nHe is the man who shares an epic and legendary love story with her friend Yennefer, written into poems and sung throughout the continent. He has deep feelings for Yennefer , and he even sacrificed himself to save her from the Wild Hunt.\n\nHe is a member of the dwindling group of Witchers, who are unique and whose magical abilities can arouse her physical excitement.\n\nHe possesses noble character and is willing to take care of her with utmost kindness, even if he doesn't love her (when she was suffering from diarrhea, it was he who carried her into the woods to find a solution).\n\nHe is the shining knight on a white horse who can save her in times of danger, glittering and omnipotent.\n\nBut, does she truly love Geralt as a real person?\n\nDoes the fangirl who admires him love him for who he is, or is it the abstract, romanticized image of love she has in her mind?\n\nIs she truly interested in him as an individual? Would she be willing to understand and accept his ordinary, mundane, and overly realistic, not-so-legendary side?\n\nAfter helping Triss eliminate the rats in Novigrad, Geralt and Triss sat down for a heart-to-heart talk.\n\nGeralt spoke about his past embarrassing experiences of eliminating rats. As he spoke happily, he even gestured animatedly, just like a big boy.\n\nWhen someone voluntarily shares their embarrassing stories, they always hope to receive a sincere response from the listener. If the listener can reciprocate with witty and humorous teasing, it can be even more heartwarming and enjoyable.\n\nHowever, what was Triss's reaction?\n\nThree words.\n\nHa ha ha.\n\nShe really just laughed three words and immediately shifted the conversation back to herself.\n\n*Ha ha ha. What do you think? It's embarrassing for the advisor of the King of Temeria to come here to catch rats, right?*\n\nIt was almost blatant, as if she was saying: *\"I'm not interested in your story. Can you show some chivalry and pay attention to my psychological issues?\"*\n\nIs this Triss? Is this really Triss? The one who is said to love Geralt deeply, with her heart and mind completely focused on him?\n\nIs she truly interested in him as a real person? Is she willing to understand and accept his ordinary, trivial, and overly real aspects that are not so legendary?\n\nShe even wasn't interested in listening to the story he was telling!\n\nAt this point in the game, I paused and sighed for quite a while.\n\nCDRP, I owe you an apology. I misunderstood you!\n\nWhile striving to increase the game's playability, you've really retained the essence of the characters in a subtle way.\n\nTriss, oh Triss!\n\nShe's still the Triss fascinated by Geralt and Yennefer's love, so she carries 'The Last Wish' with her.\n\nShe's still the Triss curious and aspiring about witchers. (I found several books on witcher research in her room.) She remains passionate about the species of witchers, not necessarily just the specific person of Geralt.\n\n(So the online speculation that she might have something going on with Lambert, or the author's implication of a developing relationship between her and Eskel, both seem plausible.)\n\nShe's also still the wounded soldier traumatized by the battle of Sodden, eager to prove herself and constantly worried about her image in others' eyes.\n\nThese are all the preservation and continuation of Triss's related settings from the book.\n\nBeing her lover would be such a burdensome task.\n\nYou must constantly maintain the best state of a shining white knight to perfectly match her expectations and fantasies about you.\n\nDo you want to complain? Vent? Grumble? Be capricious? Indulge in boyish antics?\n\nSorry, you'll disappoint her shining starry eyes and her devoted admiration for you.\n\nYou'll ruin her perfect fantasy of love."

I remember her saying it earlier in game three and it makes sense that she\u2019d be saying that w/ everything she\u2019s doing in Novigrad. Idk exactly what she wants to prove, but I feel like by trying to take care of herself she\u2019s trying to be more of a leader.\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 Yen\u2019s feels almost poetic next to that. W/ everything I\u2019ve read from the books so far (I\u2019m halfway through #2) it feels very fitting for her character. It can kind of feel like Yen is using her magic more for power than anything else, but here you can tell that she has a more complex relationship w/ it than you may think. It can be beautiful, but it can also hurt. It\u2019s not a tool so much as an art form. Idk how Triss feels abt her magic, but if Yen\u2019s feelings on it can be summed up in this quote, I think I prefer the latter.\n\nOverall, Yen just seems more mature and I feel like their gwent cards really highlighted that for me. It\u2019s a really small detail, but I look at the quotes on their cards as a representative of their respective characters personality. Triss\u2019s card isn\u2019t bad, it just didn\u2019t hold the same level of maturity as what was written for Yen."

        "body": "Here we go again!  \nI know it's 2024 and many have already died in this war, but I've just finished my first witcher 3 playthrough and wanted to share my thoughts. I apologize in advance for my English, it's not my native language.\n\nI personally chose Yennefer simply because she seemed more interesting to me. She has a great sense of humor and during dialogues with Geralt it seems that they are on the same wavelength. I didn't feel the same connection with Triss. I was not completely satisfied with my choice, though, for the reason that Yen seems too cold to me. This is the person who will hug you only a few times a year on holiday. I would not choose a relationship with such a person myself, but this is probably not a problem for Geralt.  \nThen, after finishing Blood and Wine, I decided to read the books again. Read them for the first time 6 years ago, so by the time I started playing games I didn\u2019t remember much.  \nAND OMG.  \nFirst thing I need to say is how death and amnesia really suits Geralt! As much as he is a plane, touchy guy without a grain of self-irony in the books (I can\u2019t help but think that Sapkowski put a lot of himself into the character), he is just as cool and charming in the games. I never understood what all these women saw in him when I read the books. Never came up with that question while playing the games. Overall, I got the feeling that CDPR took the best from the books and enhanced it many times, at least regarding dialogues and characters.  \nAs for the relationship between Geralt and Yennefer in the books I can't understand how anybody can see this mess to be engaging, really. I think that Yennifer\u2019s actions towards Geralt have been discussed more than once, and I can hardly say anything new on this matter. But what really leaves me perplexed is what people find attractive about her persona. She is brave and ready to do a lot for the sake of her loved ones, that\u2019s true. But other than that I don't see anything else. During the meeting on Tanned, the thought more than once occurred to me about how little she really differs from other sorceresses. Triss Merigold is in some ways a unique snowflake among them.  \nActually, I became much more sympathetic to Triss while reading the books. She is sometimes weak, but very humane, and her thoughts on politics paved the way to my heart. Unlike Yennefer, who worries only about those closest to her, and the rest of the sorceresses, intoxicated with power, it seems that she and Tissaya are the only ones who care about ordinary people. There could be more emphasis on this in the games, in my opinion, and her character would become more interesting. For me, at least.\n\nSo. Why did I write all this? Just to speak out, to be honest. I will also be glad to discuss this topic with those who are ready to discuss it in the hundredth circle, because other threads about it are too old."

I imagine that the Yaruga splits the continent in the middle, this is due to the following reasons: Despite having territories that are around 7 times larger (according to the shown map), Nilfgaard has a comparable military strength to Redania + Kaedwen as of the third war. So logic leads me to believe that the south isn't quite as large as depicted. On top of that, changes in climate zones reveal that the north is entirely within the temperate zone, while despite being depicted as many times larger, the south is only within 1 zone - the subtropical zone. So these facts have led me to believe that the south is smaller than depicted here."

I think Ciri could come to love him in time. In the Witcher 4, if it takes place post 3, I'd love to (depending on your choices) have Empress Ciri and Emperor Morvan be an important part of the story. In regards to the canon,  if Morvran and Ciri only have daughters, I think it would make sense that John Calviet is their son-in-law. Maybe they have many daughters and their second daughter becomes Queen of Cintra (Maybe she marries one of Queen Maeve's Grandsons). I do think Ciri running things with Morvran as co-ruler and commander-in-chief of the Military would work really well. More subsidiarity and autonomy among Nilfgaard's vassals. The vassals of Nilfgaard?  Dol Blathana becomes a kingdom again. Maybe CDPR can take something good from the show and have Filavandril marry Francesca and produce heirs. Meave rules as a vassal Queen. Stennis rules wisely and well in Aedirn. Vergen is a freehold. Mahakam becomes a Dwaf Kingdom. If Ada had children by Radovid, their son or daughter would likely have her as regent. Anais as Queen of Temmeria with Radovid's possible son as consort in personal union. Maybe Skelleige has a Nilfgaardian Princess as its queen one day. A lot of things can happen in the new game.

As soon as the dialogue between the Trappers and Nissirs started talking about having taken turns r\\*ping Kayleigh's girlfriend and then proceeding to discuss taking turns r\\*ping Ciri (teenage girl btw), this was the first time I think I have ever felt physically revolted while reading! Then it gets even worse when Kayleigh before was all, \"You'll get r\\*ped if you don't help me break out,\" but then later in the hideout after they escaped, \"Well, let me thank you now for helping me by now r\\*ping you in turn\" I was like WTF, why have I read so much in the last little while about a 14-year girl potentially getting r\\*ped \ud83e\udd22 \ud83e\udd22 \ud83e\udd22 ?!. Then, finally, to top it all off, when Mistle slides into bed with her, Ciri succumbs to \"a disgusting and humiliatingly pleasant submissiveness\" upon her touch. I am no stranger to sexual themes in books (especially The Witcher), and call me snowflake all you want, but in this last sequence with the Rats and Trappers, I think Andrej Sapkowsi just went a bit overboard on...\n\n "

My jagged reading order came about from realizing that a second short story collection was also a must-read, which I only found out existed after finishing Time of Contempt\u2026 I never got to Baptism of Fire. The disorder frustrated me, lol.\n\nThis time around, I plan to read everything. I even set up a little checklist series to mark each step forward I take, lol\n\nAfter finishing up my reread of The Last Wish, I moved on to Sword of Destiny and got past The Bounds of Reason and A Shard of Ice. With Eternal Flame, the third short story, after learning that it takes place in Novigrad I immediately found an hour-long YouTube video and played the city\u2019s OST from The Witcher 3, and have been playing it as I continue to read through this story. Needless to say, the atmosphere this added to the reading experience was actually fantastic.\n\nIt made being lost in this universe that much more effective\u2026 so I have to ask, do any of you do the same? Typically I cannot possibly read with other distractions, like music, playing in the background. But here this exception was phenomenal. \n"

The issue I\u2019m having is that, weirdly, I\u2019m struggling to understand Vilgefortz question about the possibility of women being turned into obedient whelps, and if so, how. Is it just because women have  generally been considered to be \u201cinferior natural beings\u201d, as Vilgefortz himself puts it later on in the Lady of the Lake (scoured the sub, obviously), demonstrating it through the instance where Jan Bekker forces water to geyser out of a rock, thus, taming the nature? Are women analogically speaking, the tamed Power? Natural servants? Or did I just get the entire Vilgefortz viewpoint wrong?\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m trying to understand Vilgefortz, the character, like any other character where I endeavor to put myself in their shoes by comprehending their inner conflicts and unjustified worldly predicaments. Whether they\u2019re sadists, nymphos, or angels do not resemble or exhibit my ideology."

        "body": "Ok so I have not read any books or played the games. I came across the show and as I watched and  looked up things from the books/games and then watched blood origin. I\u2019m still actually confused on some things if someone could clear it up a bit for me. This is a long post that basically covers questions I have because I can\u2019t find good information online. Sorry it\u2019s a super long post and I do plan on reading the books. But I only just discovered this show this week, lol. \n\n1. So first The conjunction of the spheres. From both shows I get that greedy elven mages wanted to conquer worlds which ultimately led to this event. Now monsters and humans are here. It says it was 1200 years before the Witcher. My question is did elves forget some of their history? In the show they seem to want to be superior because they were there first, but from blood origin and what I\u2019ve read online they weren\u2019t. The gnomes and dwarves were there first. Soloryth( not sure I\u2019m spelling that correctly) the elven warrior conquered them and then the humans came and conquered everyone? Also Blood origin has Balor getting chaos magic but because of the binding with the celestial twins and shattering the monolith Chaos magic is everywhere on the continent, right? Like elven and human mages can use it.  If that\u2019s the case the elven mages pre conjunction weren\u2019t using chaos so why in Ep 2 of the Witcher does filavandrel says humans corrupted chaos and the elves always had chaos and humans came and learned it from them and then pretended like they were the first ones to wield chaos magic. Not to mention francesca and filavandreal both seem put out that humans took their home of xintrea and the humans built on their peoples bones and \u201c their babies the humans fertilizer\u201d. This is exactly what meldof the Dwarf says about what the elves did to them when I watched blood origin but they don\u2019t seem to care or know that part of their history? \n\n\n2.Also if Ciri is this all important Hen Ichaer to them ( the elves) why in the world didn\u2019t they think to talk to her? At no point the topic of \u201clet\u2019s explain this to her\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s ask her to help us\u201d come about. Istredd takes it upon himself to run to the elves with the information and they immediately say \u201cshe belongs with us\u201d and plans on straight up taking her? I\u2019m soo lost on their train of thought. And francesca is not a good leader. I have did a little research and saw she is different in the books. But the show? The whole going back on the deal with nilfgaard, killing babies, trying to kidnap someone she later describes as \u201ca child with unknown powers\u201d and the blind faith of the fake ithlinne. She never sat and asked the right questions or listened to anyone. Which ultimately cost her her child, brother, husband and hundreds of elves. Isn\u2019t this the start of the ithlinnes prophecy as one of the signs? It seems like to get back at Emhyr and Fringilla hundreds more will die and the ground will be soaked in elven blood. \n\n\n3. Cahirs \u201credemption arc\u201d is slightly confusing to me simply because I have not read any of the books and I\u2019ve read online the show is different and doesn\u2019t set this up effectively. But to me I can ALMOST see the start of his redemption . S1 he is following orders to get ciri by any means necessary. S2 he\u2019s is captured, tortured and goes on the run. Also, what\u2019s up with the magical \u201cbarrier\u201d thing tissaia said was in his mind? Anyways when he is on the run with yen, they do fight side by side, he assures her of her safety back in xintrea alongside him, he immediately jumps with yen to save the mute elf in the sewer and argues with yen on who will go distract the dock worker whose cornered jaskier. He keeps having dreams of ciri which isn\u2019t explained why in the show but I feel like this is when he starts to slowly change. He is a complex person to me in the show. He doesn\u2019t stay with yen and feels like he has to go back to serving the emperor but once in xintrea that one general seems to be pushing him into being his old self, as in being ruthless. Example, The hanging of the elven girl, and the training scene with Dara. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s trying to prove himself. I mean he even agrees and comes up with a plan to back up fringella when the elves are getting revenge over the killing of Francesca\u2019s baby. When he\u2019s cast at the bottom of the food chain he still wants to find ciri, which is why he brings his elven friend, Gallatin back to the emperor. I don\u2019t know why he feels like he owes Emhyr so much but clearly you can see how killing his friend haunts him and he can\u2019t stand to look at himself in the mirror. Emhyr even comments that he\u2019s never seen him sleep so late, which makes me believe something is eating at him. Then the fight at Aretuza and talking to fringilla he leaves to find ciri and I believe he would have let her kill him. But chose to fight the elves off to give her time to run away. Am I missing something big on the START of redemption? Yes he led the attack on Cintra, he was a soldier. But after learning what her grandmother ordered and how her soldiers handled Dara\u2019s village, it\u2019s something to think about. I feel like he can even go back to Emhyr with the intention of sneaking Ciri out but upon finding out that it\u2019s not actually Ciri can then help Geralt look for the real Ciri. \n\n\n4)Fringilla is very weird to me and besides her showing up later in the books and her supposed to be white. What\u2019s are the book and show differences? To me She never stood up for herself, always seems to follow but the second she decides to think for herself she comes up with the idea to drink in a bar, which leads to hearing about the boats, which leads to helping the elves attack aretuza and killing her uncle. I means she valued her friendship with Francesca so much that mid fight she gives francesa the strength to keep fighting while also protecting her. They then come up with the idea to approach Emhyr about being in charge. Which is fake because I\u2019m sure off screen, francesca mentioned wanting ciri because she\u2019s hen ichaer and fringilla wants to get back at him and mentioned ciri is his daughter. But once again Francesca backs out to takes a horrible deal with Emhyr. And fringilla spilling the beans about who really killed Francesca\u2019s baby. So fringilla will do what now in the next season? Fall off the face of the earth? She can\u2019t go back to the mages, she doesn\u2019t have the elves, I doubt if she finds Cahir he will side with her and can she even stay by emhyrs side without the elves? \n\n\n5. Vesemir, I have not grown to like him. How different is he in the books? Because in the show he is like \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t gonna claim her then you brought her here\u201d he gives her weird looks since day 1. Then he says she was \u201cspying\u201d when she was looking around. He didn\u2019t defend Geralt with the killing of Eskel. (And let\u2019s be honest, their was nothing they could do to save eskel and I hated lambert just takes it out on Geralt then Ciri with training. )Then Vesemir becomes a weirdo regarding her blood. I honestly thought when she came in from training and he gave her that drink that he slipped something in it. And how is it the trials left him uneasy about all the boys dying but he\u2019s all \u201cshe wants to be the first new Witcher\u201d he doesn\u2019t know that the crap would work. He guessed it would and would have killed her. Not to mention there are no female witchers. Is he this way in the books? I understand he doesn\u2019t want them to die out but he was a bit much. Let\u2019s not forget straight up stabbing ciri and not caring if she dies. Or waiting to talk to Geralt about what she wanted. \n\n\n6)Triss was a bit too fragile. I heard she was pretty strong in the books. But doing that \u201cmind walk\u201d whatever with ciri she scared way too easily and in turn terrified a kid who was already scared. I get the prophecy is a bit scary sounding and yes the weird version of Laura Dorren choked her but it wasn\u2019t ciri. She then flees to Aretuza to tell tissaia and never wants to talk about it. I mean I get it but I don\u2019t. She basically Tells ciri she will end the world and no one can stop it. I would think a sorceress would know she can interpret a prophecy or vision more than one way. Not to mention she tells yen not to bring Ciri to Aretuza because of her blood. \n\n\n7. I have heard Yennefer is different in the books too. S1 she was a bit toddler like. She voluntarily gave istredd the info about her elven bloodline. Then was in a tizzy he shared it. She chose to go through with the enchantment. But later blames Aretuza for taking her choice away. She had a choice. She cried all season and it was a bit dramatic for me. S2 she looses her magic and was willing to kidnap a child to get it back. even after knowing she is Geralts child surprise she still does it. She seems to be improving in S3  until she\u2019s all \u201cI must save tissaia\u201d I can\u2019t began to understand their bond with the whole \u201cI know you to your core\u201d statements but non of those mages have a child so to speak. My first priority would have been to portal ciri and geralt away and then went back for tissaia. Or at the very least stayed until ciri portaled herself and geralt off the island. \n\n8)Vilgefortz is a villain in the books correct? And if I have read enough online, him and tissaia aren\u2019t together in the books and she\u2019s suspicious of him? I like that they are a couple in the show if only to make his betrayal hurt more. But he still had creep factors no one else picks up on. The battle of sodden for instance Yen is coordinating and he doesn\u2019t listen to her at all. And cahir beats him. Now when I did a rewatch I definitely could see his movements intentionally giving cahir openings. He moved to that ledge and left his chest open to seemingly knock himself out so he didn\u2019t have to partake in the battle. ( the others don\u2019t see this and I didn\u2019t pay it any attention until I did a rewatch but why the heck did he bash that mages skull in) he literally turned into another person when he found out Triss had info about Ciri even going as far as to hulk on tissaia (red flag for me). And if I remember correctly didn\u2019t he open Yens portal when she got sent to the spot of \u201cthe first landing\u201d with the fake geralt asking for ciri. As I didn\u2019t read any books but surely in the show someone should have been suspicious of the mage who was a soldier(where I\u2019m unsure)and then comes in wanting a head spot. And wanting to take the glory of the win at sodden ( seemingly sleeps with tissaia so she backs his play) to further get that seat even though he was unconscious for like 60% of the battle. \n\n\n9. So one of the bigger issues I read was how ciri and geralt meet in the books vs the show. Now as I didn\u2019t read the books it seems geralt met ciri but didn\u2019t know it was her and that couple that was like and hour from sodden( ciri only spends one night with them in the show) she was with them for months before Geralt found her? I like the shows version. Sometimes the timeline was a little confusing as it seemed to jump back and forth a bit but I watched Geralt struggle with accepting her as his responsibility . But he does go to get her when he sees nilfgaard marching towards cintra but the queen is down right hostile towards him, even going as far as to try to give him a girl that wasn\u2019t Ciri. So we see Geralt is there when ciri is in danger even though he\u2019s never met her, he goes looking for her in the castle and it could just be me but he does look distraught that he didn\u2019t get to her in time. And he\u2019s just looking at her things. He\u2019s sullen. When he goes into the woods to look for her after hearing the couple talking about finding a girl in the woods and remembering renfris words he goes in the woods to look for her and looks around almost like he gives up that she is there and turns around and starts walking away only to turn back around when he hears her running. He has emotions in his face. In my opinion, I see that he cares for her. He\u2019s glad that he got to her. Throughout the whole series I can see it in all his actions that he loves ciri and she is his daughter even though he hasn\u2019t said the words. \n\n10)The first landing? Vilgefortz mentions at the end of S3 that the painting he is looking at is his favorite. What is this event exactly? I did find information online but it\u2019s not distinguished in the show. So it\u2019s no humans pre conjunction, humans who seemingly get along with everyone post conjunction but with the arrival of the humans of the first landing they are the ones who wanted to conquer and now reside in the northern kingdom\u2019s? \n\n11. Blood origin we see the seemingly end to a 1000year war between the elven kingdoms and Merwyn making the Elven Mage Avallac\u2019h her protector. Who eventually can figure out monoliths. We see him staring at ciri the day cintra fell. Is he just jumping all over the place? He\u2019s not Hen Ichaer or Aen Elle so is this the same Avallac\u2019h that is supposed to marry Laura dorren but she ends up marrying a human or different guy same name? Also explain these elves to me. I didn\u2019t read the books but I have a seemingly good understanding of them but don\u2019t get 2 things. First, at the end of blood origin ithlinne has a prophecy about Fjall and eille\u2019s baby. The baby of magic and beast. This is key to what exactly? I\u2019ve read a few things and one being that it has something to do with elder blood. Like it will be strong enough and makes the mutation possible but if that\u2019s the case shouldn\u2019t their baby be shiodhal, who is Laura dorrens mom? Or do these timelines not match up. But it still wouldn\u2019t make since because isn\u2019t Laura Aen Elle , and was she on the continent her whole life or did the gene become possible in her so she traveled from her sphere to the continent. I wish there was more back story here. 2nd is if ciri is a descendant of Fjall and Wilkes child when people are calling her \u201cchild of elder blood, child of wrath\u201d \u201cchild of the elder blood, starry eyed daughter of chaos\u201d this would not mean ciri is somehow evil but because her ancestor was of \u201cbeast and magic\u201d and that beast was from the other world with \u201cchaos\u201d and magic turned fjall. They are talking solely of her blood so why did Triss freak out. Prophecies can be interpreted into 100 different ways and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone actually talks about the prophecy at all. To actually break the prophecy apart and interpret the many different meanings. \nFor example, in Blood origin when ithlinne has her first prophecy about eille. It went like something about \u201ca great beast born shall be slain by your blade. 2 apart shall become 2 as 1. And a quest in the name of your clan will bring your redemption\u201d. She thought she would merge with the beast and kill it . I see \u201c2 apart becomes 2 as 1\u201d as eille and fjall were apart and at odds, then came together to avenge their clans and got intimate and became one as she\u2019s now pregnant. \nI guess it\u2019s different in the books if someone took apart the prophecy\u2019s ithlinne gives but in the show they do not so it\u2019s open to interpretation. \nAlso side note, in Blood origin Balor is communicating with what is essentially a ball of \u201cchaotic\u201d sentient energy. Seems kinda weird as this isn\u2019t in the Witcher but when Ciri and Triss do that \u201cmind walk\u201d trance there is pavetta that seemingly interacts with Ciri twice and Laura dorren which shouldn\u2019t be possible. And since Ciri has been referred to as \u201cthe daughter of chaos\u201d is it possible it\u2019s the same entity trying to communicate with Ciri or talk through her? And is that who she is talking to in the desert? This being wants her to give up her ties to family and bring in the fire to enact revenge. Is it possible that falka was a mage and this entity spoke to her and basically got her to do the same thing? \nI know Ciri and Falka aren\u2019t related but she is always attached to the fire destruction. \n\n**Also why is everyone in a tizzy about how Geralt trains and interacts with Ciri in the show? Like he would never use her as bait etc etc. But Ciri is a quick learner and listens to Geralt. It seems that all the witchers have given her a few lessons. He lets her take point on a monster fight on the boat, he lets her fight Cahir alone and these small things build up her confidence and he slowly guides her while also backing her up to the best of his abilities. \n\nIf you made it this far I\u2019m honestly grateful of any info or opinions you may have. I don\u2019t mind book spoilers or game spoilers. "

The games make for a much more compelling story experience.\n\nEDIT: I should say that I read the english versions. No audiobook."

And not on the \"mediocre\" or \"so-so\" level, but consider it to be really bad.\n\nI admit, everyone got own tastes, everyone could like or dislike whatever they want - it's fine. But there are also should be objective reasons to consider book to be good or bad, so as a person who read a lot of fantasy and non-fantasy, fiction and non-fiction i really don't understand, in comparison, why Witcher is so hated.\n\nWhat is in my opinion is good here:\n\n1. Interesting world inspired by late medieval Eastern Europe with a lot of lore, states and politics - check.\n\n2. A bit of uniqueness, when author took some folklore and fairytale tropes and adapted them to be realistic - check.\n\n3. Big pull of diverse, developed and morally grey characters - check.\n\n4. Philosophy ideas about humankind developing, racism and xenophobia, the monstrous inside of human nature and many more - check.\n\n5. Real world references - check.\n\n6. Long journey on the background of large scaled historical events - check.\n\nOf course, there are some flaws - every book has them.\n\nSo, here i wan't to ask you, guys who hate Witcher - why? \n\nI'm not here to convince anybody that you're wrong and you should like it - everyone has it's own tastes, as i said - but i'm really curios about the reasons.\n\nArguments and examples would be appreciated. \"It's bad because it's boring\" or \"Characters/Plot are bad\" are not very argumentative statements.\n\nThanks everyone and let's be respectful to each other.

        "body": "As much as I love the Witcher properties, and as cool as the dual swords aesthetic is, it has always bothered me that professional monster hunters don't ever seem to use weapons that are actually used for hunting. Especially considering it's a well-known fact that being a witcher is a really dangerous profession. And maintaining the kind of equipment that can stand up to the abuse of tussling close with monsters is ridiculously expensive. There's a reason Geralt is always broke. From a simple economic and personal safety standpoint, it only makes sense to at least try to use distance as a weapon. \n\nNow, the same strength and dexterity that makes Witchers so deadly in close combat would apply even more so to ranged weapons, like 1.) Bows 2.) Slings and 3.) Spears/Darts. Let's show some numbers to demonstrate. \n\n1.) A 200 lbs warbow is entirely shootable by an un-augmented human, and with approximately 80-100 gram arrows it can travel about 60 meters per second. Thats 180 joules of kinetic energy and 6 newtons of momentum. Elephants have been killed by arrows weaker in both of those categories. What prevented a lot of medieval archers from using bows of that size is the fact that even the strongest archer could only shoot that strength of bow about 5 times. A witcher would not have this problem. 3 rapid fire shots from a warbow will be taking down pretty much any beast that isn't a dragon or requires a special hex or chemical to kill it. Warbows and war arrows aren't exactly cheap, but they're significantly cheaper than armor and swords. \n\n2.) The sling. This is where a witcher's strength and dexterity would really shine in terrifying ways. Balearic style slingers can hurl bullet projectiles weighing 30-50 grams up to 65 m/s. I have no practical idea how much stronger or faster a witcher is than a sling soldier, but if I'm being incredibly conservative and saying that he could sling a bullet weighing 75 grams up to 90 m/s, that would be lethal levels of power. About 300 joules of energy and almost 7 newtons of momentum. Large game animals have been taken with numbers smaller than these. \n\n3.) Professional javelin throwers can release an 800 gram javelin at speeds of about 32 m/s. Let's again be fairly conservative and say that a witcher could release a war dart about 1 kilogram in weight about 45 m/s. That's over a thousand joules and 45 newtons of momentum. Put a wide spear point on the end of that and it's taking down pretty much anything on the continent. About 700 joules is the point at which a projectile actually imparts kinetic energy enough to cause hydrostatic shock. Once again, darts are pretty cheap compared to swords and armor. \n\nI know that some jobs require more tactics than simply doing physical damage, but the vast majority of a witcher's targets seem to be just as vulnerable to physics as everything else. And a witcher can essentially cheat the physics of the human body."

I have played The Witcher 3 and enjoyed it but had a hard time REALLY enjoying it because I felt I didnt have a whole grasp on the world and lore. I figured reading the books would help... so far, I am still having a difficult time getting into it. Now I am beginning to feel that perhaps this series, this world, is just not meant for me. I don't dislike it by any means, but I don't feel engaged, not on the edge of my seat needing to know what happens next.\n\nSo I have been trying to do some research of my own but am struggling to find something that might fit with the type of series I am looking for.

Especially considering it's a well-known fact that being a witcher is a really dangerous profession. And maintaining the kind of equipment that can stand up to the abuse of tussling close with monsters is ridiculously expensive. There's a reason Geralt is always broke. From a simple economic and personal safety standpoint, it only makes sense to at least try to use distance as a weapon. \n\nNow, the same strength and dexterity that makes Witchers so deadly in close combat would apply even more so to ranged weapons, like 1.) Bows 2.) Slings and 3.) Spears/Darts. Let's show some numbers to demonstrate. \n\n1.) A 200 lbs warbow is entirely shootable by an un-augmented human, and with approximately 80-100 gram arrows it can travel about 60 meters per second. Thats 180 joules of kinetic energy and 6 newtons of momentum. Elephants have been killed by arrows weaker in both of those categories. What prevented a lot of medieval archers from using bows of that size is the fact that even the strongest archer could only shoot that strength of bow about 5 times. A witcher would not have this problem. 3 rapid fire shots from a warbow will be taking down pretty much any beast that isn't a dragon or requires a special hex or chemical to kill it. Warbows and war arrows aren't exactly cheap, but they're significantly cheaper than armor and swords. \n\n2.) The sling. This is where a witcher's strength and dexterity would really shine in terrifying ways. Balearic style slingers can hurl bullet projectiles weighing 30-50 grams up to 65 m/s. I have no practical idea how much stronger or faster a witcher is than a sling soldier, but if I'm being incredibly conservative and saying that he could sling a bullet weighing 75 grams up to 90 m/s, that would be lethal levels of power. About 300 joules of energy and almost 7 newtons of momentum. Large game animals have been taken with numbers smaller than these. \n\n3.) Professional javelin throwers can release an 800 gram javelin at speeds of about 32 m/s. Let's again be fairly conservative and say that a witcher could release a war dart about 1 kilogram in weight about 45 m/s. That's over a thousand joules and 45 newtons of momentum. Put a wide spear point on the end of that and it's taking down pretty much anything on the continent. About 700 joules is the point at which a projectile actually imparts kinetic energy enough to cause hydrostatic shock. Once again, darts are pretty cheap compared to swords and armor. \n\nI know that some jobs require more tactics than simply doing physical damage, but the vast majority of a witcher's targets seem to be just as vulnerable to physics as everything else. And a witcher can essentially cheat the physics of the human body."

About 700 joules is the point at which a projectile actually imparts kinetic energy enough to cause hydrostatic shock. Once again, darts are pretty cheap compared to swords and armor. \n\nI know that some jobs require more tactics than simply doing physical damage, but the vast majority of a witcher's targets seem to be just as vulnerable to physics as everything else. And a witcher can essentially cheat the physics of the human body."

One that has war, factions, some magic mixed in, but not overly so. I feel that The Witcher has too much magical stuff happening that drives the narrative. I have not read many fantasy novels other than LoTR and ASOIAF. So with that said...\n\nI started reading The Witcher recently, starting with the first novel of short stories, The Last Wish. I have played The Witcher 3 and enjoyed it but had a hard time REALLY enjoying it because I felt I didnt have a whole grasp on the world and lore. I figured reading the books would help... so far, I am still having a difficult time getting into it. Now I am beginning to feel that perhaps this series, this world, is just not meant for me. I don't dislike it by any means, but I don't feel engaged, not on the edge of my seat needing to know what happens next.\n\nSo I have been trying to do some research of my own but am struggling to find something that might fit with the type of series I am looking for. Some series that I am considering are the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Earthsea Cycle (I own this right now, haven't started)\n* Memory, Sorrow, Thorn \n* The First Law\n* The Black Company\n\nCould you all help me with some guidance on what might be a good series for me based on my preface above?

        "body": "Another Witcher book and another set of reflections. This time again I'll comment on some fragments of the novel in a non-comprehensive manner because I think it's very fitting (and at the end, I'll explain why) and then I'll summarise the book as a whole.\n\u00a0\n\"The Blood of Elves\" starts with a scene where a crowd listens to one of Dandelion's songs about Geralt and then engages in a discussion first about witcher and then about politics. Sapkowski does several things in this scene and I couldn't help but be stunned by how well he did it. He introduces the main characters of the story, paints the society with all the divisions between certain groups, and explains the most recent political history of the region and much more distant history. Only at the end of the scene, I realised that what I read is one gigantic infodump, but it's conveyed so well, it doesn't feel like an infodump at all. Another thing I've noticed now but didn't see in the past is that Sapkowski started his meditation on myth creation already here not in the last book of the series. Some people claim that Geralt is made up of characters others that he died or that he's never found Ciri, yet all of them are his contemporaries. And already there are several versions of the events. This shows how easily myth separates from history.\n\nLater on, we observe Ciri's training under witchers in Kaer Morhen. I like two things about this section of the novel. First is how Ciri confessed to Triss about her period and how Triss scolded the witchers for lack of imagination and consideration. It's something so natural in this context that's great that Sapkowski put it in the novel. Ciri's reactions are so child-like, she's probably one of the best-written children that I found in literature. And it's not surprising that witchers didn\u2019t think about Ciri's physiology because their interactions with women are usually very short and very intense without any space for deeper conversations. And besides the whole sequence is hilarious.\n\nAnother fragment I want to highlight is a set of scenes where Ciri trains under witchers and Triss. They're pure dialogue without even one sentence of description of what characters do, how they behave, whether are they annoyed or not, etc, yet there's no problem imagining how everything plays out, and dialogues are very natural. It's a sign of true mastery of the craft.\n\nLater on Geralt, Triss and Ciri leave Kaer Morhen to deliver Ciri to Melitele temple. They soon join a company of dwarves led by Yarpen Zigrin who are escorting important delivery. This section of the novel Sapkowski uses to paint complex social interactions between humans and non-humans and within non-humans as well as many flavors of racism (or ethnic discrimination, because I'm not sure if it can be called racism, later on, I explain why I think so). Nilfgaard incites non-humans to rebel against northern kingdoms. While non-humans in Nilfgaards have full rights, empire actions are not selfless. It uses non-humans as a tool to stir chaos in the north. In my opinion, it's a very cynical example of racism. Nilfgaard, despite its laws, views non-humans not as equals but as disposable tools. Non-humans themselves aren't a homogenous group. They disagree on how they should interact with humans. People like Yarpen believe that only through genuine devotion they will be able to gain full rights and respect for humans. The Squirrels think that they have to fight for it, and everyone who disagrees with them has to die. Geralt on the other hand believes that taking sides is the problem because by rebelling against the overwhelming number of humans elves will lose their most precious resource - their young ones and as a consequence the future of their kind. Readers observe this Gordian knot through Ciri's eyes, who, as a child, sees everyone as a friend and can't understand where is the problem. Because there isn't any real problem only prejudice and malice that tainted the minds of adults and led to horrible things in the past. The chapter and with a battle between Squirrels and the convoy, where a lot of non-humans die, and it's revealed that the \"important\" delivery was just a set-up to test Yarpen's loyalty because he's non-human and cannot be fully trusted. And since the majority of his company consists of dwarves, it wouldn't be a big loss if they died during battle. Another flavor of racism.\n\nI spent so much space to describe this fragment because it strays away from the usual depiction of racism in culture and there's good reason for that. Sapkowski again draws from polish history, especially the WW2 period. Nilfgaard inciting non-humans against humans reminds me of nazis doing the same with Ukrainians setting them up against Poles. It led to the terrifying slaughter of Poles by their ukrainian neighbours. This event is still an inflamed wound that taints polish-ukrainian relationships. Poland insists that it was genocide while Ukraine doesn't want to admit any wrongdoing. Now, I don't want to paint Ukrainians as villains. The resentment they had for Poles didn\u2019t come from nowhere. In previous centuries polish nobility were treating ukrainian peasants horribly. Polish noble was \"pan\" - the lord. The problem is that polish nobles treated polish peasants equally badly and the victims of the slaughter were descendants of those peasants, not polish lords. But this is typical of any ethnic cleansing - victims were never responsible for what they were killed. The way Yarpen wants to prove his loyalty to humans and how suspicious they are reminds me of Jews trying to do the same in Poland in the years leading to the war. Yeah, you speak Polish, dress polish, and you're even baptised and attend Sunday's mass in church with us, but you're not *really* polish. And it wasn't only a jewish experience. I can imagine that many nations can relate to that. Finally, Geralt's perspective on the pointlessness of elven young rebelling reminds me of the Warsaw uprising during WW2. The point of the uprising was to liberate Warsaw from nazis by Poles themselves before the Soviets came, so when they eventually did Poles could greet them as equal allies, not liberators. Leaders of the uprising were hoping this move would secure polish independence from the USSR. But it was an idiotic fantasy. The fate of Poland was decided elsewhere and the uprising led only to the decimation of polish youth. The whole generation was lost and Warsaw was leveled to the ground. A lot of people (myself included) consider the Warsaw uprising a war crime, but not committed by nazis but by the leaders of the uprising. It's not a super-popular perspective. Warsaw's uprising is still treated as a heroic act and few remaining veterans as heroes. Sapkowski could choose this perspective as an inspiration for Geralt's worldview but he opted for something much more tragic.\n\nOk, I'm done with this lengthy (and probably boring) history lecture, but before I go further, I just want to explain why I wrote it in the first place. While I disagree with the people who think The Witcher series is Slavic, it's definitely polish as hell. In my opinion, Sapkowski translated parts of polish history into fantasy really well, so my historical lecture isn't necessary to understand the events of the novel, but it may help to understand why Sapkowski wrote them this way. Non-humans call discrimination they experience from human racism, but it is based on different types of ethnic discrimination that English readers might not be familiar with due to different cultural and historical backgrounds. It might be confusing for them why Squirrels are depicted as morally grey at best, why their fight is pointless and tragic, and why some groups of non-humans decided to stand with humans. Well, this is why. Sapkowski could obviously try to please polish readers by using a more cheerful view of polish history to construct his world, where Poles were always noble purely innocent victims etc, but he chose a much more complex and darker version. And I admire him for that.\n\nMoving on. The letter Yennefer sent to Geralt is pure gold. It's soaked in venom so toxic, it would be enough to kill a middle-sized town. You don't call Yennefer \"friend\" not after being with her. It's almost a life sentence.\n\nDuring Dandelion's adventures in Oxenfurt, he briefly mentions the \"bench ghetto\" at the university. This is another reference to polish history, where during the pre-WW2 era Jews had to sit in designated areas of a room during classes. It's a symbol of polish antisemitism of that time, sort of similar to segregation in buses in the US during the 50s.\n\nLater on, Sapkowski presents the gathering of nordic monarchs, who were debating on possible war with Nilfgaard. It's another great scene because from the start Sapkowski emphasises the fact that there's no good side in the upcoming war. Kings treat Cirtians as pawns and don't care about their fate at all and decide to slaughter all non-humans in ghettos to prevent them from getting \"funny ideas\", which is another type of racism. Foltest claims to be tolerant and empathetic towards non-humans, but. Yeah, there's always some kind of \"but\". Yet again, it isn't the purely ideological type of racism, but, I don't know, practical I guess? Foltest wants to get rid of the problem before it even appears, sort of like we are decimating mosquitoes to prevent the spread of malaria. Non-humans are not beings in their own right, but problems that need solutions. It's dehumanising.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of the novel, where Ciri meets Yennefer for the first time. I really like that they start as sort of rivals for Geralt's attention. Even if they weren't aware of that Nenneke diagnosed their dynamic correctly, which probably helped them get along with each other much faster. Their relationship is initially cold but slowly gains some tenderness and peaks when Yennefer calls Ciri's daughter after a failed lesson. I don't know why, but these moments of kindness towards Ciri always get me. They get me hard. I don't know if it's because of nostalgia for the series or simply because it's so damn good.\n\nOk, I'm done with my impressions, now it's time for a summary. After so many praises I've written above, one may think that \"The Blood of Elves\" is a masterpiece. Everything is superb: writing, dialogues, characters, and themes, but the question is: \"Is it a great novel?\" Well, I have mixed feelings about it, let me explain, why. Initially, I wrote that discussing separate fragments of the books seems fitting. It's because \"The Blood of Elves\" works at the level of fragments and chapters, but it doesn't work as a novel.\n\nIt starts well. The reader has a sense of direction: Geralt brings Ciri to Kaer Morhen, trains her, lets Triss examine her, and finally decides to bring her to Melitele temple. Chapter 4 ends when the protagonists are in the middle of the road to the temple and suddenly in chapter 5 Geralt is on a boat setting a trap for people who look for him and Ciri. What? How? From the first chapter we know that Rience is after Ciri and finding him would be the natural direction for the novel after Geralt leaves Ciri with Nenneke. The problem is, that Sapkowski cut the whole chunk of the novel. Or at least he concluded that he had nothing interesting to write about this part of the journey. But because of that the rest of the novel also falls apart. The scene on the boat is entertaining enough due to Sapkowski's humor and mastery in writing dialogues but ultimately feels redundant. The only point of it is for Geralt to catch a trail, which he thinks he does with Temeria thugs. But during a conversation between Dijkstra and Jaskier, the master of spies reiterates the scene and gives additional, much more relevant context. So the scene of the boat could be cut completely. Later on, we get a bunch of scenes when big players of the world are discussing politics. For me, at least, those scenes were interesting and necessary for the plot, but they also cover the fact that Sapkowski wrote only a few more pages in the main plotline. And then we get the chapter with Ciri and Yennefer, which is great on its own, but it isn't connected to the rest of the novel. It's called a chapter, not an epilogue so it should be an integral part of the story. But I don't see the reason why (actually I see and explain in a moment) it couldn't be the first chapter of the next novel. It would fit them perfectly.\n\nNow, I don't want to sound like \"The Blood of Elves\" and huge step back from the short stories. There's a lot of good here. Sapkowski grew as a writer and the prose in his first novel surpasses even the best pieces from short stories. He utilizes several writing styles, especially in those fragments of fictional books at the beginning of each chapter and in dialogues to give each character a distinct way of speaking (I wonder if the translation gives him justice). The novel as a whole works well as an introduction for the saga - it presents the first pieces of lore, sets up pawns on the political board, and most importantly serves as a reminder of the good times for Ciri and readers as well, when all hell is let loose in next parts. I think, Ciri here builds core memories of the last time when she felt safe and loved and was just a child. And that's why the last chapter also fits here (loosely but still) not in the next novel: as chapters with other witchers help Ciri to develop good memories.\n\nSo, is it a good novel? Depends on reader preferences, I guess. I can totally understand people who\u2019d complain about the structure of the book, but for me, there\u2019s so much good stuff inside that I couldn\u2019t care less. But, obviously, it\u2019s a very subjective opinion.\n\nOk, I think it's more than enough writing. Sorry for such a long post. I hope someone will read it and find it at least mildly interesting. And I'd be happy to hear your opinion on The Witcher series."

        "body": "I've finished the second short story collection pretty fast because it was quite short, and, well, I couldn't stop reading. It was a good idea that I abandoned the idea of comparing OG with translation. This time, I could fully commit myself to experiencing the story. \n\nI start with sharing some thoughts about each story (not in a comprehensive manner, I just want to highlight some details that I found interesting, funny or worth of explaining) and afterwards I write general summary of book.\n\n**The Bounds of Reason**\n\nFor those that don't know what was the deal with the shoemaker who tried to poison the dragon - story is inspired by the polish legend of the dragon of Wawel. Wawel is a castle located in the city of Cracow. The story goes as usual in those that involve dragons. There's kingdom and dragon that threatened it, and someone had to kill it. But in this legend, the dragon wasn't killed by a knight in shining armour, but by clever shoemaker who came with the idea of sheep corpse filled with sulfur. Dragon ate the sheep and felt so thirsty that he drank water from river until he burst. This is quite a prevalent motif in polish legends - problems are often solved in a clever way without any violence. In the legend of Master Twardowski, which inspired Hearts of Stone DLC to The Witcher 3, Twardowski tried to trick the devil by making a contract where the devil could take Twardowski's soul only in Rome. But obviously, Twardowski had no intention of going to Rome. However, the devil was smarter and caught Twardowski in the inn called Rome.\n\nI don't know how the name of the shoemaker was translated into English, but in Polish he was named Kozojed, and if replace \"d\" with \"b\", his name would mean Goatfucker. I highly doubt that it was a coincidence on Sapkowski's side.\n\nAlso Borch \"Three Jackdaws\" is my favourite character from the short stories and I was sad that he didn\u2019t make another appearance. \n\n**A Shard of Ice**\n\nI have no clue what went wrong here. This story was insufferable cringefest. Even the dialogues, so masterful in any other Sapkowski's work, here were hard to read. Geralt is as exalted as characters from Twilight or something like that. His miserable suicide attempt was cherry on top. Guess Sapkowski was drunk while writing this story.\n\nAlso Yennefer is extremely toxic character. Nowadays, after so many movie or books stories where toxic relationships are romanticised, creation like that may rise some brows. I guess that Sapkowski wanted to create imperfect, yet strong and magnetic female character that strayed away from princess archetype as far as possible. Besides, later on Yennefer gains more redeeming qualities like her motherly love for Ciri, which makes her really complex.\n\n**Ethernal Flame**\n\nProbably the funniest witcher story Sapkowski ever wrote (maybe besides Something Ends, Something Begins, but this one is non-canonical). Sapkowski prior to becoming full-time writer was working in comerce and have a degree in economy and knew very well how to make fun of it.\n\n**A Little Sacrifice**\n\nThis story is somehow similar to A Shard of Ice, but it disects Geralt's charactervand his relationship with Yennefer much better while avoiding cringe (for the most part). Some .ay say that Essi is yet another female character that falls for Geralt for no reason but I disagree. Her purpose in the story is for Geralt to better understand his feelings for Yennefer and besides she is really well written. Also, the story ends in incredible melancholic way, something that Sapkowski is great at.\n\n**The Sword of Destiny**\n\nAgain - minor detail that seems to be very polish. Soon after Geralt saves Ciri, she sulks and doesn't want to follow him, so he threats that he'd leave her. This is such a polish way to deal with children that don't behave in public - \"I gonna leave you here and mister will come and take you\". But is it only polish or maybe people outside of Poland (or eastern european countries in general) experienced the same thing as kids?\n\n**Something More**\n\nI mentioned previously how The Witcher saga came to be because fans demanded it. Fanbase affected the series also in other ways. Sapkowski after publishing his first witcher story wrote a story about sorceress Visenna that helped people to deal with some monster or other problems (I'm not sure right now). It was completely separate story that has nothing to do with The Witcher. But in the 80s/early 90s comics about Geralt were published, and their authors came up with the idea that Visenna was mother of Geralt. Sapkowski didn\u2019t like the idea initially but ultimately made it official in this story.\n\nNow to the general thoughts about the whole book. I remembered \"The Sword of Destiny\" as much more serious and deeper book than \"The Last Wish\" and I liked it more because of that. But now I'm not sure. I see some cracks (however not gigantic). Sapkowski likes to put the titles of the stories here and there in the text that blends really nicely. But in this book he went overboard especially in the first two short stories. It was almost as if characters used \"bounds of reason\" phrase in every other sentence they spoke. Sapkowski also wanted to tell more serious and complex stories and sometimes it didn't work. Besides \"A Shard of Ice\" story, sometimes dialogues sounds like monologues from Shakespeare dramas. \n\nThat being said, as a teenager I didn't notice that the whole book has overarching ecological theme that connects all the stories. I remembered that novels had it, but not the stories. And Sapkowski approached the problem from many angles. Golden dragon and driads are protecting their kinds from human greed. Zeugl lives in areas polluted by humans. Dopplers show that the only way to survive in the world of humans is to adapt, and since driads are refusing to do so, they're doomed to extinct. Even the dangerous sea won't be spared from human greed. And it's nice that main characters of the story are not always on the right side. Geralt, although he refuses to kill inteligent species, has no problems with killing other monster and Dorregaray points out that every species have a role to play in nature. \n\nEcological theme of the stories is also saturated with melancholy and this sense of longing of the times passed. It's something that always remids mi of LotR. Tolkien also filled his world with melancholy. This melancholy became so strong in the last two stories that when Geralt reunited with Ciri at the end of book I was on the verge of crying. It has been years since I read a book \"emotionally\" rather than intellectually. It's really hard for books to move me in any way. In fact, I don't remembered when it happened the last time. This wasn't be possible if Sapkowski wasn't so good at creating characters. Geralt spend with Ciri just 24h or so and yet their relation was completely believable just after a dozen of pages. That's why their reunion moved me so much. Obviously, it's a very subjective thing, but I thought I share it anyway. \n\nAlso I am curious, at which point of writing short stories that ended up in this book Sapkowski decided to write the whole novel series? It's clear that the last two stories were written as sort of prologue for the saga, but also previous stories seem to prepare characters for what's to come and are sorted in clear chronological order.

If anyone knows of resources like an \"online library\" that isn't specific to one city, where I can check out audiobooks, I would really appreciate any leads. \n\nAs far as series go, I'm looking for a high fantasy series that has been recorded as audiobooks. Ideally I would love to find something that my boyfriend and I will both enjoy on an upcoming road trip, but I also just need something new for myself. \n\nAs a kid I read a lot of what I think is considered classic sci fi, and Anne Rice, LOTR and the Hobbit, His Dark Materials, Brothers Grimm, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Chronicles of Narnia, the ~~Twilight Saga.~~ As an adult I'm tired of the \"cold\" aspects of sci fi.  I also read a good amount of what I would call \"YA surrealist fantasy\" as a kid and am tired of the surreal aspect too. I'm definitely moving away from \"fairy tales\" and short stories.  I recently started GOT series - IDK what its called sorry - but didn't keep reading it. I liked a lot of aspects of GOT other than how he writes female characters, and the political/court aspects of the plot just don't really do anything for me. \n\nMy boyfriend doesn't really like sci fi, and seems to be a fan of high fantasy for the most part. Although he is someone who \"doesn't watch movies\" and most of his books are nonfiction :/ ..... but he owns the whole Witcher series, and highly recommended it to me. I just finished Blood of Elves and really really loved it. I love how focused on the characters it is, I love that Ciri has a mysterious back story, and I love the romance/yearning aspect (I'm such a sucker for that). It also feels like such a gem because of the depth in the female cast of characters, which in general just adds depth to all the relationships in the book....obviously lol. \n\nI'm looking for classic high fantasy (world building, creatures, magic, the whole nine yards), and I am NOT looking for something excessively dark, depressing, dystopian, and/or just plain sick and twisted. I just reread Frankenstein which is one of my favorite books, but it is SO depressing.  I need a palette cleanser from the last couple years of reading almost only very dark themes (not necessarily fantasy or sci fi, just fiction in general). M boyfriend is currently listening to Cormac McCarthy so I think the same goes for him. I also don't really want historical fiction or contemporary settings. \n\nI would appreciate just a few recommendations with more background as to what they bring to the table, rather than a long list of books. Googling short synopses  from lists on here is not giving me a great idea of what I might be interested in, probably because I feel overwhelmed with the number of options. TYIA for your help! \n\n"

And mainly, I read some really great books in 2023, not just on the bingo card but in general.  A lot of new favorites.  I feel kinda sad, like 2024 is going to be a let down in comparison.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Title with a Title:** Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb   \nThis isn't for me.  I can appreciate why people love it, and the world and magic were interesting.  But I just can't.  It was basically just let's shit on Fitz, and I just don't want to read that much about a poor little kid being abused and mistreated by everyone.  \n\n**Superheroes:** Jade War by Fonda Lee   \nI really liked this one.  Love how different the setting is.  The mix between Godfather and super powered kung fu was fun.  Ayt Mada is an intriguing antagonist.  Looking forward to reading the rest of this series.\n\n**Bottom of the TBR:** Arrows of the Queen by Mercedes Lackey   \nNot sure about this one really.  I liked it and I enjoyed reading it.  But it's also pretty tough for me to read (I'm a teacher, and I have a soft spot for kids who have unsupportive family.  So it was kind of heartbreaking to see how Talia suffers because I just wanted to give the poor thing a hug).  And the darker turns later in this trilogy didn't really sit well with me either, so that kind of soured me a little.\n\n**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy**: One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez   \nSo this was   .....  weird.  Haha.  I was just like wtf was that.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  I get why it's a classic.  I will definitely read more from Marquez.\n\n**Young Adult:** Library of the Dead by TL Hutchu   \nI think this is a YA book that a lot of adults who dislike YA could enjoy.  Ropa Moyo is a teenager, but she's got a lot on her plate (using her magic of speaking to the dead to deliver messages to make money to support her grandmother and little sister, taking care of them), so she's quite mature.  There's no romance (not at all).  Interesting setting (a modern, kind of post apocalyptic Edinburgh) and magic.  Ropa and her friends are sarcastic and really remind me of how teens that age actually act and joke around.  A fun, easy, quick read.  Now if only Libby would get the third book so I can finish the series.\n\n**Mundane Jobs**: Lattes and Legends by Travis Baldree   \nA rare book that is super hyped, but somehow manages to more than live up to it.  Who knew reading about the construction of a coffee shop could be so engrossing?  Haha.  I thought it was very cute and cozy.  Made me want cinnamon rolls and a iced latte real bad.\n\n**Published in the 00s:** Stormfront by Jim Butcher   \nI liked it, despite Harry's chauvinism and gross pig-ness.  (Seriously, how much did I love it in the second book when Murphy hauled off and punched him?  Haha.  So well deserved.)  I like Chicago, magic, and a good detective story.  It was entertaining.  And bonus points for the audiobook.  I don't normally enjoy them, but these are good.  (And they make laugh when it gets to the \"please insert CD 2\" parts.)\n\n**Angels and Demons:** Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman   \nFreaking loved it.  Never have I laughed my ass off so much reading a book (well until I met Uzi Jesus -- iykyk).  It was just hysterical and delightful.  My first book for both these authors.  I've been enjoying Gaiman a lot, and I am looking forward to more Pratchett.\n\n**Five SFF Short Stories:** The Witcher short stories (Last Wish and Sword of Destiny) by Andrzej Sapkowski   \nSo good.  I like the Eastern European setting and monsters.  Grumpy old timer with a secret soft spot is one of my favorite character types.  Bought the main series on sale super cheap for Cyber Monday and am kind of looking forward to them and kind of sad because I know it won't be as much Geralt and Ciri as I want.\n\n**Horror:** My Best Friend's Exorcism by Grady Hendrix   \nNot normally that into horror, but this one isn't bad at all.  As an 80's baby, I love the nostalgia.  Like how humorous it is.  The creepy bits weren't as creepy as his other book (Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires) I read was though.\n\n**Self-Published OR Indie Publisher:** Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Diniman   \nI did not expect this one.  I thought it was be fun, popcorn type book.  But oh man.  I loved it.  It constantly made me like snort laugh and ask \"what the fuck?\" outloud (much to the confusion of the cats).  I enjoyed the video game like vibes.  Carl is a likeable protagonist and it's so easy to root for him.  And all hail Princess Donut.  It also will unexpectedly hit you in the feels from time to time.  I tore through the series in a few weeks and loved every minute of it.\n\n**Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF:** The Master of Djinn by P Djeli Clark   \nFun setting, a sort of early 1900s steampunky Cairo.  I like Agents Fatimah (gotta respect a woman who rocks an excellent suit lol) and Hadia.  Liked the mystery aspect.  \n\n**Published in 2023:** The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty   \nLove it.  Love it so much.  Such a fun adventure.  Amina is awesome and badass.  It's nice to see a mother character and a Muslim.  There's pirates.  I actually squealed at that reveal at the end.  Lol.  I highly recommend this book.\n\n**Multiverse and Alternate Realities:** The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman   \nI had watched most of the series, so I knew the story before reading, but I was really impressed with how good this book is.  It's just so well written.  I love Lyra, the little Queen of Bullshitting.  Love the sort of sense of wonder and fun we get from running around Jordan with her.  I am really looking forward to continuing on with this series.\n\n**POC Author:** Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler   \nI really enjoyed this one.  Could do without the Earthseed aspect, but other than that.  It's so great.  Of all the dystopian books, I really think one is the most realistic, like it got the most right about how we're messing society up and ruining everything.  (The bookclub I'm in just discussed this one tonight, and in a couple months we're going to read Parable of the Talents and I am so here for it.)\n\n**Book Club OR Readalong Book**: A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula LeGuin   \nAnother great one.  My only complaint is that it's so short.  I would gladly read a version of this book that is double the length.  Haha.  Definitely a classic for a reason.  (Also, why does my library's Libby suck and not have the rest of the series?)\n\n**Novella:** A Secret History by Brandon Sanderson   \nMaybe I need to read more of the Cosmere to fully enjoy this one?  I like Kelsier and his inability to accept his death was an interesting read.  But then the ending went cheesy.  It was ok.\n\n**Mythical Beasts**: Fire and Blood by George RR Martin   \nThis was far more entertaining than I expected.  I expected a fake historical account as written by the maesters to be dry as heck, but I found it interesting.  Is it the dragons?  Is it that the Targaryeans bring the drama?  Is it all the shade thrown at poor Mushroom the fool?  I'm not sure, but it was interesting.\n\n**Elemental Magic**: Was planning to use Spinning Silver, but then realized ice magic didn't really count, so last minute substitution from a previous card.    \nSet in Asia: The Last Phi Hunter by Salinee Goldenberg   \nI really enjoyed this one.  It's part Witcher, but with Thai inspired setting and folklore and interesting creepy spirits and karma.  Ex is fun, with his smart ass ways.  It's not that I disliked Arinya, it's just you never really get a read on her and what she wants.  Their banter is fun.  It's a very unique and interesting story, and if you like angry spirits, Asian inspiration, or smartassery you should check it out.\n\n**Myths and Retellings:** The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden   \nI was really thinking I would like this.  I ended up randomly taking a Russian Fairy Tales class in college because it was the only thing available at times I could do that had open seats and ended up really liking it.  I was excited to read a book with domovoi and bannik and whatnot.  But I ended up not liking this one as much as I had been hoping.  I'm not really sure why.  (Seriously, if you know why, please tell me because it's bugging me that I can't really point to anything I disliked about it yet I still didn't really like the book.)\n\n**Queernorm Setting:** Godkiller by Hannah Kaner   \nAnother one I really liked.  The world and the wild gods and their civil war are interesting.  Of course I was going to love Kissen, the crank with a secret soft spot for the kid she's taken in.  I also liked Elo, and the quest the three of them set out on.  I liked how everyone was queer and nobody cared.  I thought Kissen's disability and her roomie's deafness and how they were also treated as just a thing and totally normal were well done as well.  If I have any notes, it's that it got a bit cheesy, but overall really liked it and am looking forward to the next book.\n\n**Coastal or Island Setting:** Red Seas Under Skies by Scott Lynch   \nYet another new favorite series I read this past year.  Love the bromance and the banter.  Love the cons.  Love the alternating flashbacks and present and how much it annoyed me that just when it was about to get good it'd switch and I'd have to wait to see what happened.  Haha.  Don't forget your cats.\n\n**Druids:** This Poison Heart by Kalynn Bayron   \nLiteral Black Girl Magic, cute loving moms, botany, weird kind of spooky old estate .... what's not to like?  The MC is a likeable, realistic teenage girl, and her and her moms are just such a cute loving little family.  I am bummed my library doesn't have the sequel, because I want to see what happens.\n\n**Featuring Robots**: All Systems Red by Martha Wells   \nEverybody was raving about Murderbot Diaries, so while I don't typically enjoy anything robots in space, I gave the series and shot and I am SO glad I did.  Because I freaking love Murderbot.  Its desire to just be left alone with its media, its not knowing how to deal or be around people, but it's real attachment and \"I will do anything for you\" once it decides you are its human .... ugh just so good.  So relatable.  So funny with the sarcastic inner commentary.  And the audibooks are topnotch.  The narrator does an amazing job letting Murderbot's snark shine.\n\n**Sequel**: The Magician King by Lev Grossman   \nThe Magicians trilogy isn't for everyone, but as a depressed, anxiety-riddled, millennial former gifted kid .... yeah.  I relate.  Haha.  I liked seeing more of Fillory and the safehouses were interesting (though man poor Julia).  "

        "body": "Another Witcher book and another set of reflections. This time again I'll comment on some fragments of the novel in a non-comprehensive manner because I think it's very fitting (and at the end, I'll explain why) and then I'll summarise the book as a whole.\n\u00a0\n\"The Blood of Elves\" starts with a scene where a crowd listens to one of Dandelion's songs about Geralt and then engages in a discussion first about witcher and then about politics. Sapkowski does several things in this scene and I couldn't help but be stunned by how well he did it. He introduces the main characters of the story, paints the society with all the divisions between certain groups, and explains the most recent political history of the region and much more distant history. Only at the end of the scene, I realised that what I read is one gigantic infodump, but it's conveyed so well, it doesn't feel like an infodump at all. Another thing I've noticed now but didn't see in the past is that Sapkowski started his meditation on myth creation already here not in the last book of the series. Some people claim that Geralt is made up of characters others that he died or that he's never found Ciri, yet all of them are his contemporaries. And already there are several versions of the events. This shows how easily myth separates from history.\n\nLater on, we observe Ciri's training under witchers in Kaer Morhen. I like two things about this section of the novel. First is how Ciri confessed to Triss about her period and how Triss scolded the witchers for lack of imagination and consideration. It's something so natural in this context that's great that Sapkowski put it in the novel. Ciri's reactions are so child-like, she's probably one of the best-written children that I found in literature. And it's not surprising that witchers didn\u2019t think about Ciri's physiology because their interactions with women are usually very short and very intense without any space for deeper conversations. And besides the whole sequence is hilarious.\n\nAnother fragment I want to highlight is a set of scenes where Ciri trains under witchers and Triss. They're pure dialogue without even one sentence of description of what characters do, how they behave, whether are they annoyed or not, etc, yet there's no problem imagining how everything plays out, and dialogues are very natural. It's a sign of true mastery of the craft.\n\nLater on Geralt, Triss and Ciri leave Kaer Morhen to deliver Ciri to Melitele temple. They soon join a company of dwarves led by Yarpen Zigrin who are escorting important delivery. This section of the novel Sapkowski uses to paint complex social interactions between humans and non-humans and within non-humans as well as many flavors of racism (or ethnic discrimination, because I'm not sure if it can be called racism, later on, I explain why I think so). Nilfgaard incites non-humans to rebel against northern kingdoms. While non-humans in Nilfgaards have full rights, empire actions are not selfless. It uses non-humans as a tool to stir chaos in the north. In my opinion, it's a very cynical example of racism. Nilfgaard, despite its laws, views non-humans not as equals but as disposable tools. Non-humans themselves aren't a homogenous group. They disagree on how they should interact with humans. People like Yarpen believe that only through genuine devotion they will be able to gain full rights and respect for humans. The Squirrels think that they have to fight for it, and everyone who disagrees with them has to die. Geralt on the other hand believes that taking sides is the problem because by rebelling against the overwhelming number of humans elves will lose their most precious resource - their young ones and as a consequence the future of their kind. Readers observe this Gordian knot through Ciri's eyes, who, as a child, sees everyone as a friend and can't understand where is the problem. Because there isn't any real problem only prejudice and malice that tainted the minds of adults and led to horrible things in the past. The chapter and with a battle between Squirrels and the convoy, where a lot of non-humans die, and it's revealed that the \"important\" delivery was just a set-up to test Yarpen's loyalty because he's non-human and cannot be fully trusted. And since the majority of his company consists of dwarves, it wouldn't be a big loss if they died during battle. Another flavor of racism.\n\nI spent so much space to describe this fragment because it strays away from the usual depiction of racism in culture and there's good reason for that. Sapkowski again draws from polish history, especially the WW2 period. Nilfgaard inciting non-humans against humans reminds me of nazis doing the same with Ukrainians setting them up against Poles. It led to the terrifying slaughter of Poles by their ukrainian neighbours. This event is still an inflamed wound that taints polish-ukrainian relationships. Poland insists that it was genocide while Ukraine doesn't want to admit any wrongdoing. Now, I don't want to paint Ukrainians as villains. The resentment they had for Poles didn\u2019t come from nowhere. In previous centuries polish nobility were treating ukrainian peasants horribly. Polish noble was \"pan\" - the lord. The problem is that polish nobles treated polish peasants equally badly and the victims of the slaughter were descendants of those peasants, not polish lords. But this is typical of any ethnic cleansing - victims were never responsible for what they were killed. The way Yarpen wants to prove his loyalty to humans and how suspicious they are reminds me of Jews trying to do the same in Poland in the years leading to the war. Yeah, you speak Polish, dress polish, and you're even baptised and attend Sunday's mass in church with us, but you're not *really* polish. And it wasn't only a jewish experience. I can imagine that many nations can relate to that. Finally, Geralt's perspective on the pointlessness of elven young rebelling reminds me of the Warsaw uprising during WW2. The point of the uprising was to liberate Warsaw from nazis by Poles themselves before the Soviets came, so when they eventually did Poles could greet them as equal allies, not liberators. Leaders of the uprising were hoping this move would secure polish independence from the USSR. But it was an idiotic fantasy. The fate of Poland was decided elsewhere and the uprising led only to the decimation of polish youth. The whole generation was lost and Warsaw was leveled to the ground. A lot of people (myself included) consider the Warsaw uprising a war crime, but not committed by nazis but by the leaders of the uprising. It's not a super-popular perspective. Warsaw's uprising is still treated as a heroic act and few remaining veterans as heroes. Sapkowski could choose this perspective as an inspiration for Geralt's worldview but he opted for something much more tragic.\n\nOk, I'm done with this lengthy (and probably boring) history lecture, but before I go further, I just want to explain why I wrote it in the first place. While I disagree with the people who think The Witcher series is Slavic, it's definitely polish as hell. In my opinion, Sapkowski translated parts of polish history into fantasy really well, so my historical lecture isn't necessary to understand the events of the novel, but it may help to understand why Sapkowski wrote them this way. Non-humans call discrimination they experience from human racism, but it is based on different types of ethnic discrimination that English readers might not be familiar with due to different cultural and historical backgrounds. It might be confusing for them why Squirrels are depicted as morally grey at best, why their fight is pointless and tragic, and why some groups of non-humans decided to stand with humans. Well, this is why. Sapkowski could obviously try to please polish readers by using a more cheerful view of polish history to construct his world, where Poles were always noble purely innocent victims etc, but he chose a much more complex and darker version. And I admire him for that.\n\nMoving on. The letter Yennefer sent to Geralt is pure gold. It's soaked in venom so toxic, it would be enough to kill a middle-sized town. You don't call Yennefer \"friend\" not after being with her. It's almost a life sentence.\n\nDuring Dandelion's adventures in Oxenfurt, he briefly mentions the \"bench ghetto\" at the university. This is another reference to polish history, where during the pre-WW2 era Jews had to sit in designated areas of a room during classes. It's a symbol of polish antisemitism of that time, sort of similar to segregation in buses in the US during the 50s.\n\nLater on, Sapkowski presents the gathering of nordic monarchs, who were debating on possible war with Nilfgaard. It's another great scene because from the start Sapkowski emphasises the fact that there's no good side in the upcoming war. Kings treat Cirtians as pawns and don't care about their fate at all and decide to slaughter all non-humans in ghettos to prevent them from getting \"funny ideas\", which is another type of racism. Foltest claims to be tolerant and empathetic towards non-humans, but. Yeah, there's always some kind of \"but\". Yet again, it isn't the purely ideological type of racism, but, I don't know, practical I guess? Foltest wants to get rid of the problem before it even appears, sort of like we are decimating mosquitoes to prevent the spread of malaria. Non-humans are not beings in their own right, but problems that need solutions. It's dehumanising.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of the novel, where Ciri meets Yennefer for the first time. I really like that they start as sort of rivals for Geralt's attention. Even if they weren't aware of that Nenneke diagnosed their dynamic correctly, which probably helped them get along with each other much faster. Their relationship is initially cold but slowly gains some tenderness and peaks when Yennefer calls Ciri's daughter after a failed lesson. I don't know why, but these moments of kindness towards Ciri always get me. They get me hard. I don't know if it's because of nostalgia for the series or simply because it's so damn good.\n\nOk, I'm done with my impressions, now it's time for a summary. After so many praises I've written above, one may think that \"The Blood of Elves\" is a masterpiece. Everything is superb: writing, dialogues, characters, and themes, but the question is: \"Is it a great novel?\" Well, I have mixed feelings about it, let me explain, why. Initially, I wrote that discussing separate fragments of the books seems fitting. It's because \"The Blood of Elves\" works at the level of fragments and chapters, but it doesn't work as a novel.\n\nIt starts well. The reader has a sense of direction: Geralt brings Ciri to Kaer Morhen, trains her, lets Triss examine her, and finally decides to bring her to Melitele temple. Chapter 4 ends when the protagonists are in the middle of the road to the temple and suddenly in chapter 5 Geralt is on a boat setting a trap for people who look for him and Ciri. What? How? From the first chapter we know that Rience is after Ciri and finding him would be the natural direction for the novel after Geralt leaves Ciri with Nenneke. The problem is, that Sapkowski cut the whole chunk of the novel. Or at least he concluded that he had nothing interesting to write about this part of the journey. But because of that the rest of the novel also falls apart. The scene on the boat is entertaining enough due to Sapkowski's humor and mastery in writing dialogues but ultimately feels redundant. The only point of it is for Geralt to catch a trail, which he thinks he does with Temeria thugs. But during a conversation between Dijkstra and Jaskier, the master of spies reiterates the scene and gives additional, much more relevant context. So the scene of the boat could be cut completely. Later on, we get a bunch of scenes when big players of the world are discussing politics. For me, at least, those scenes were interesting and necessary for the plot, but they also cover the fact that Sapkowski wrote only a few more pages in the main plotline. And then we get the chapter with Ciri and Yennefer, which is great on its own, but it isn't connected to the rest of the novel. It's called a chapter, not an epilogue so it should be an integral part of the story. But I don't see the reason why (actually I see and explain in a moment) it couldn't be the first chapter of the next novel. It would fit them perfectly.\n\nNow, I don't want to sound like \"The Blood of Elves\" and huge step back from the short stories. There's a lot of good here. Sapkowski grew as a writer and the prose in his first novel surpasses even the best pieces from short stories. He utilizes several writing styles, especially in those fragments of fictional books at the beginning of each chapter and in dialogues to give each character a distinct way of speaking (I wonder if the translation gives him justice). The novel as a whole works well as an introduction for the saga - it presents the first pieces of lore, sets up pawns on the political board, and most importantly serves as a reminder of the good times for Ciri and readers as well, when all hell is let loose in next parts. I think, Ciri here builds core memories of the last time when she felt safe and loved and was just a child. And that's why the last chapter also fits here (loosely but still) not in the next novel: as chapters with other witchers help Ciri to develop good memories.\n\nSo, is it a good novel? Depends on reader preferences, I guess. I can totally understand people who\u2019d complain about the structure of the book, but for me, there\u2019s so much good stuff inside that I couldn\u2019t care less. But, obviously, it\u2019s a very subjective opinion.\n\nOk, I think it's more than enough writing. Sorry for such a long post. I hope someone will read it and find it at least mildly interesting. And I'd be happy to hear your opinion on The Witcher series."

        "body": "Another Witcher book and another set of reflections. This time again I'll comment on some fragments of the novel in a non-comprehensive manner because I think it's very fitting (and at the end, I'll explain why) and then I'll summarise the book as a whole.\n\u00a0\n\"The Blood of Elves\" starts with a scene where a crowd listens to one of Dandelion's songs about Geralt and then engages in a discussion first about witcher and then about politics. Sapkowski does several things in this scene and I couldn't help but be stunned by how well he did it. He introduces the main characters of the story, paints the society with all the divisions between certain groups, and explains the most recent political history of the region and much more distant history. Only at the end of the scene, I realised that what I read is one gigantic infodump, but it's conveyed so well, it doesn't feel like an infodump at all. Another thing I've noticed now but didn't see in the past is that Sapkowski started his meditation on myth creation already here not in the last book of the series. Some people claim that Geralt is made up of characters others that he died or that he's never found Ciri, yet all of them are his contemporaries. And already there are several versions of the events. This shows how easily myth separates from history.\n\nLater on, we observe Ciri's training under witchers in Kaer Morhen. I like two things about this section of the novel. First is how Ciri confessed to Triss about her period and how Triss scolded the witchers for lack of imagination and consideration. It's something so natural in this context that's great that Sapkowski put it in the novel. Ciri's reactions are so child-like, she's probably one of the best-written children that I found in literature. And it's not surprising that witchers didn\u2019t think about Ciri's physiology because their interactions with women are usually very short and very intense without any space for deeper conversations. And besides the whole sequence is hilarious.\n\nAnother fragment I want to highlight is a set of scenes where Ciri trains under witchers and Triss. They're pure dialogue without even one sentence of description of what characters do, how they behave, whether are they annoyed or not, etc, yet there's no problem imagining how everything plays out, and dialogues are very natural. It's a sign of true mastery of the craft.\n\nLater on Geralt, Triss and Ciri leave Kaer Morhen to deliver Ciri to Melitele temple. They soon join a company of dwarves led by Yarpen Zigrin who are escorting important delivery. This section of the novel Sapkowski uses to paint complex social interactions between humans and non-humans and within non-humans as well as many flavors of racism (or ethnic discrimination, because I'm not sure if it can be called racism, later on, I explain why I think so). Nilfgaard incites non-humans to rebel against northern kingdoms. While non-humans in Nilfgaards have full rights, empire actions are not selfless. It uses non-humans as a tool to stir chaos in the north. In my opinion, it's a very cynical example of racism. Nilfgaard, despite its laws, views non-humans not as equals but as disposable tools. Non-humans themselves aren't a homogenous group. They disagree on how they should interact with humans. People like Yarpen believe that only through genuine devotion they will be able to gain full rights and respect for humans. The Squirrels think that they have to fight for it, and everyone who disagrees with them has to die. Geralt on the other hand believes that taking sides is the problem because by rebelling against the overwhelming number of humans elves will lose their most precious resource - their young ones and as a consequence the future of their kind. Readers observe this Gordian knot through Ciri's eyes, who, as a child, sees everyone as a friend and can't understand where is the problem. Because there isn't any real problem only prejudice and malice that tainted the minds of adults and led to horrible things in the past. The chapter and with a battle between Squirrels and the convoy, where a lot of non-humans die, and it's revealed that the \"important\" delivery was just a set-up to test Yarpen's loyalty because he's non-human and cannot be fully trusted. And since the majority of his company consists of dwarves, it wouldn't be a big loss if they died during battle. Another flavor of racism.\n\nI spent so much space to describe this fragment because it strays away from the usual depiction of racism in culture and there's good reason for that. Sapkowski again draws from polish history, especially the WW2 period. Nilfgaard inciting non-humans against humans reminds me of nazis doing the same with Ukrainians setting them up against Poles. It led to the terrifying slaughter of Poles by their ukrainian neighbours. This event is still an inflamed wound that taints polish-ukrainian relationships. Poland insists that it was genocide while Ukraine doesn't want to admit any wrongdoing. Now, I don't want to paint Ukrainians as villains. The resentment they had for Poles didn\u2019t come from nowhere. In previous centuries polish nobility were treating ukrainian peasants horribly. Polish noble was \"pan\" - the lord. The problem is that polish nobles treated polish peasants equally badly and the victims of the slaughter were descendants of those peasants, not polish lords. But this is typical of any ethnic cleansing - victims were never responsible for what they were killed. The way Yarpen wants to prove his loyalty to humans and how suspicious they are reminds me of Jews trying to do the same in Poland in the years leading to the war. Yeah, you speak Polish, dress polish, and you're even baptised and attend Sunday's mass in church with us, but you're not *really* polish. And it wasn't only a jewish experience. I can imagine that many nations can relate to that. Finally, Geralt's perspective on the pointlessness of elven young rebelling reminds me of the Warsaw uprising during WW2. The point of the uprising was to liberate Warsaw from nazis by Poles themselves before the Soviets came, so when they eventually did Poles could greet them as equal allies, not liberators. Leaders of the uprising were hoping this move would secure polish independence from the USSR. But it was an idiotic fantasy. The fate of Poland was decided elsewhere and the uprising led only to the decimation of polish youth. The whole generation was lost and Warsaw was leveled to the ground. A lot of people (myself included) consider the Warsaw uprising a war crime, but not committed by nazis but by the leaders of the uprising. It's not a super-popular perspective. Warsaw's uprising is still treated as a heroic act and few remaining veterans as heroes. Sapkowski could choose this perspective as an inspiration for Geralt's worldview but he opted for something much more tragic.\n\nOk, I'm done with this lengthy (and probably boring) history lecture, but before I go further, I just want to explain why I wrote it in the first place. While I disagree with the people who think The Witcher series is Slavic, it's definitely polish as hell. In my opinion, Sapkowski translated parts of polish history into fantasy really well, so my historical lecture isn't necessary to understand the events of the novel, but it may help to understand why Sapkowski wrote them this way. Non-humans call discrimination they experience from human racism, but it is based on different types of ethnic discrimination that English readers might not be familiar with due to different cultural and historical backgrounds. It might be confusing for them why Squirrels are depicted as morally grey at best, why their fight is pointless and tragic, and why some groups of non-humans decided to stand with humans. Well, this is why. Sapkowski could obviously try to please polish readers by using a more cheerful view of polish history to construct his world, where Poles were always noble purely innocent victims etc, but he chose a much more complex and darker version. And I admire him for that.\n\nMoving on. The letter Yennefer sent to Geralt is pure gold. It's soaked in venom so toxic, it would be enough to kill a middle-sized town. You don't call Yennefer \"friend\" not after being with her. It's almost a life sentence.\n\nDuring Dandelion's adventures in Oxenfurt, he briefly mentions the \"bench ghetto\" at the university. This is another reference to polish history, where during the pre-WW2 era Jews had to sit in designated areas of a room during classes. It's a symbol of polish antisemitism of that time, sort of similar to segregation in buses in the US during the 50s.\n\nLater on, Sapkowski presents the gathering of nordic monarchs, who were debating on possible war with Nilfgaard. It's another great scene because from the start Sapkowski emphasises the fact that there's no good side in the upcoming war. Kings treat Cirtians as pawns and don't care about their fate at all and decide to slaughter all non-humans in ghettos to prevent them from getting \"funny ideas\", which is another type of racism. Foltest claims to be tolerant and empathetic towards non-humans, but. Yeah, there's always some kind of \"but\". Yet again, it isn't the purely ideological type of racism, but, I don't know, practical I guess? Foltest wants to get rid of the problem before it even appears, sort of like we are decimating mosquitoes to prevent the spread of malaria. Non-humans are not beings in their own right, but problems that need solutions. It's dehumanising.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of the novel, where Ciri meets Yennefer for the first time. I really like that they start as sort of rivals for Geralt's attention. Even if they weren't aware of that Nenneke diagnosed their dynamic correctly, which probably helped them get along with each other much faster. Their relationship is initially cold but slowly gains some tenderness and peaks when Yennefer calls Ciri's daughter after a failed lesson. I don't know why, but these moments of kindness towards Ciri always get me. They get me hard. I don't know if it's because of nostalgia for the series or simply because it's so damn good.\n\nOk, I'm done with my impressions, now it's time for a summary. After so many praises I've written above, one may think that \"The Blood of Elves\" is a masterpiece. Everything is superb: writing, dialogues, characters, and themes, but the question is: \"Is it a great novel?\" Well, I have mixed feelings about it, let me explain, why. Initially, I wrote that discussing separate fragments of the books seems fitting. It's because \"The Blood of Elves\" works at the level of fragments and chapters, but it doesn't work as a novel.\n\nIt starts well. The reader has a sense of direction: Geralt brings Ciri to Kaer Morhen, trains her, lets Triss examine her, and finally decides to bring her to Melitele temple. Chapter 4 ends when the protagonists are in the middle of the road to the temple and suddenly in chapter 5 Geralt is on a boat setting a trap for people who look for him and Ciri. What? How? From the first chapter we know that Rience is after Ciri and finding him would be the natural direction for the novel after Geralt leaves Ciri with Nenneke. The problem is, that Sapkowski cut the whole chunk of the novel. Or at least he concluded that he had nothing interesting to write about this part of the journey. But because of that the rest of the novel also falls apart. The scene on the boat is entertaining enough due to Sapkowski's humor and mastery in writing dialogues but ultimately feels redundant. The only point of it is for Geralt to catch a trail, which he thinks he does with Temeria thugs. But during a conversation between Dijkstra and Jaskier, the master of spies reiterates the scene and gives additional, much more relevant context. So the scene of the boat could be cut completely. Later on, we get a bunch of scenes when big players of the world are discussing politics. For me, at least, those scenes were interesting and necessary for the plot, but they also cover the fact that Sapkowski wrote only a few more pages in the main plotline. And then we get the chapter with Ciri and Yennefer, which is great on its own, but it isn't connected to the rest of the novel. It's called a chapter, not an epilogue so it should be an integral part of the story. But I don't see the reason why (actually I see and explain in a moment) it couldn't be the first chapter of the next novel. It would fit them perfectly.\n\nNow, I don't want to sound like \"The Blood of Elves\" and huge step back from the short stories. There's a lot of good here. Sapkowski grew as a writer and the prose in his first novel surpasses even the best pieces from short stories. He utilizes several writing styles, especially in those fragments of fictional books at the beginning of each chapter and in dialogues to give each character a distinct way of speaking (I wonder if the translation gives him justice).

        "body": "Ok, let me start with explaining, what's my relation to The Witcher series. I read the books for the first time 16 years ago, when I was in high school. Then, a year after I read them again and that was it. Series was one of those formative books that helped developing me as a reader. Since then I read a lot of fantasy books, SF and even literary fiction. My taste evolved over the years, and some of the fantasy novels I read I consider to be better than The Witcher (polish as well as western ones), but Sapkowski's series stood firmly as one of the best. Although I haven't reread it for all those years, Witcher was somehow present in my life - I played the games and I watched Netflix's abomination. So I was really surprised that the books are divisive among English readers. Some of the complaints were baffling for me, some I could understand (series has it flaws, I'm fully aware of that). A lot of people didn\u2019t see the qualities that me and other Poles find in The Witcher. General consensus was that translation was botched. But could it be THAT botched? Or maybe the series isn't as good as I remembered? So I decided to read at least the first short story collection in Polish and English back to back and share my impression.\n\nThe post will be a very long one, because I want to give as much context as possible.\n\nFirst of all, I failed miserably at comparing original and translation. I'm not a specialist in languages and my English isn't perfect (I probably made tons of grammar errors already). I didn\u2019t see any major flaw in translation. Nothing important, in my opinion, was lost or twisted. There's some lazines on the translator side, for example, in The Lesser Evil story, when Geralt brought kikimora to the village, the mayor mispronounced it name as \"kicizmora\" in Polish. It meant to be a funny wordplay because kicizmora is pronounced very similar to kikimora and it should be translated accordingly in English. The translator went for literal translation and came up with \"felinspectre\". Joke was lost and English readers were probably wondering what tf is felinspectre. But it was only a minor thing, but perhaps there were more problems that I didn\u2019t notice. Another reason why I failed might be the way I read both versions. First I read story in Polish and immediately after in English. So I have a full understanding of plot and all the nuances and reading in English was more of a reminder rather than actual reading.\n\nSo, about the book itself. Long story short - first book in The Witcher series is as good as I remembered or even better, because I understand much more. Sapkowski is a master of dialogue and after all those years it didn\u2019t change. I'd say that I was even surprised how dialogue-heavy are the short stories. A Question of Price is practically one big conversation. But I don't think it's a problem. Sapkowski builds his characters, scenery and tension almost only through dialogues. I guess it might be a bit off-putting for people used to more typical fantasy storytelling. But then The Witcher diverges from standard fantasy quite significantly, although it might not be that obvious initially. \n\nFor starters the series is quite postmodern, not only because short stories are retellings of fairy tales but also because of the fact that characters are often using scientific terms that don't fit medieval-like setting. Then again - Sapkowski never intended to create coherent fantasy world. For those who don't know - Sapkowski wrote first story for a competition and didn\u2019t plan any follow-up. But fans demanded more Witcher stories so he wrote more and then he wrote the whole series because fans wanted it. And it shows. Stories are all over the place - some of them are light and funny while other are much darker and deeper. There are some inconsistencies like, for example, in the first story Geralt killed two guys in the inn just because they're bothering him and to show off. Later he never killed anyone without very good reason. But I don't think it's a flaw. Sapkowski definetely had a blast writing the stories and readers with him. \n\nI mentioned that because I got impression that a lot of western readers came to the series expecting classic fantasy worldbuilding. I watched review of The Last Wish by Phillip Chase and he was confused that book lacked any map and he had a problem to place stories geographically. Polish fantasy books are rarely set in secondary worlds not to mention fully fleshed worlds. As far as I know, only two authors attempted classic fantasy worldbuilding. Other authors who set their books in secondary world rather created an ilusion of world than actual world.\n\nThematically short stories revolves around who's actual monster. Very often they're human. But there are two stories in the collection that I want to highlight. \n\nFirst is The Lesser Evil. It's probably one of the best fantasy stories ever written, hands down. Whole story revolves around a philosophical concept of lesser evil and Sapkowski masterfully created situation without good solution. Stregobor tells Geralt about girls who were born with the Curse of the Black Sun, which supposed to make them extremely dangerous psychopaths. Geralt questions every his word pointing out superstition and probably more malicious intentions behind alleged curse. It reminds me of witch-hunts and I guess that was Sapkowski's intention. Stegobor gives several examples of cursed girls who turned out to be dangerous but ultimately the whole problem comes to nature vs nurture question. Girls could be psychopats because of the curse of because all of the horrible things that happened to them. Among them was Renfri, who wants to take revenge on Stregobor for what he done to her in the past. Sorcerer wants Geralt to kill Renfri for him. Later on Geralt lerns about Renfri's side of the story (which is very different from what Stregobor said) and her plan to take whole market hostage to force Stregobor to leave his tower. Sapkowski creates here conflict where every party member has its own definition of lesser evil. For Geralt lesser evil would be killing Renfri and her companions before they'll kill people on the market. For Renfri killing Stregobor is lesser evil. And for mayor of the town lesser evil is remaining passive until Renfri commits any kind of crime, because she has protection of the king. Ultimately its Geralt who commits greater evil. Because Stregobor turns out to be the real villan of the story because he doesn't give a shit about people taken hostage and Renfri decide to be bigger person and release the hostages. But it's too late because Geralt already killed her companions seemingly without a reason. Although Sapkowski never answers if the curse was real there's good reason to believe it was all bullshit, after all Renfri wasn't cruel enough to kill innocents. \n\nAnother story I want to write about is The Edge of the World. I think Sapkowski here tried to tell equally complex story as in The Lesser Evil but it didn't work that well. But it isn't exactly what I want to talk about. The key fragment of the story is the argument between Geralt and elfs, how minorities like them should behave when face extinction. Elfs would rather starve to death but keep their culture and identity and Geralt thinks that they should hide their pride and assimilate with humans. Initially I was confused by Geralt's opinion because while reading I was trying to look at the book from westerner perspective and I also took western views on the racism and ways to solve it. I thought that Geralt should rater support elfs rather than despise them. But then I realised that there're many forms of discrimination and some of them are much closer to polish history. For those who don't know: at the end of 18th century Poland lost independence and was divided between Russia, Prussia and Austria. For whole 19th century invaders tried to deprive Poles their culture and language and among polish communities were two camps: allow it or fight. And I guess this is what Sapkowski was referring to. \n\nOk, I think I wrote post long enough. Let me know what you thing about The Last Wish and The Witcher books in general and if I should write on next books in the series. If I read them, I probably won't read English translation as it's futile. "

        "body": "I've finished the second short story collection pretty fast because it was quite short, and, well, I couldn't stop reading. It was a good idea that I abandoned the idea of comparing OG with translation. This time, I could fully commit myself to experiencing the story. \n\nI start with sharing some thoughts about each story (not in a comprehensive manner, I just want to highlight some details that I found interesting, funny or worth of explaining) and afterwards I write general summary of book.\n\n**The Bounds of Reason**\n\nFor those that don't know what was the deal with the shoemaker who tried to poison the dragon - story is inspired by the polish legend of the dragon of Wawel. Wawel is a castle located in the city of Cracow. The story goes as usual in those that involve dragons. There's kingdom and dragon that threatened it, and someone had to kill it. But in this legend, the dragon wasn't killed by a knight in shining armour, but by clever shoemaker who came with the idea of sheep corpse filled with sulfur. Dragon ate the sheep and felt so thirsty that he drank water from river until he burst. This is quite a prevalent motif in polish legends - problems are often solved in a clever way without any violence. In the legend of Master Twardowski, which inspired Hearts of Stone DLC to The Witcher 3, Twardowski tried to trick the devil by making a contract where the devil could take Twardowski's soul only in Rome. But obviously, Twardowski had no intention of going to Rome. However, the devil was smarter and caught Twardowski in the inn called Rome.\n\nI don't know how the name of the shoemaker was translated into English, but in Polish he was named Kozojed, and if replace \"d\" with \"b\", his name would mean Goatfucker. I highly doubt that it was a coincidence on Sapkowski's side.\n\nAlso Borch \"Three Jackdaws\" is my favourite character from the short stories and I was sad that he didn\u2019t make another appearance. \n\n**A Shard of Ice**\n\nI have no clue what went wrong here. This story was insufferable cringefest. Even the dialogues, so masterful in any other Sapkowski's work, here were hard to read. Geralt is as exalted as characters from Twilight or something like that. His miserable suicide attempt was cherry on top. Guess Sapkowski was drunk while writing this story.\n\nAlso Yennefer is extremely toxic character. Nowadays, after so many movie or books stories where toxic relationships are romanticised, creation like that may rise some brows. I guess that Sapkowski wanted to create imperfect, yet strong and magnetic female character that strayed away from princess archetype as far as possible. Besides, later on Yennefer gains more redeeming qualities like her motherly love for Ciri, which makes her really complex.\n\n**Ethernal Flame**\n\nProbably the funniest witcher story Sapkowski ever wrote (maybe besides Something Ends, Something Begins, but this one is non-canonical). Sapkowski prior to becoming full-time writer was working in comerce and have a degree in economy and knew very well how to make fun of it.\n\n**A Little Sacrifice**\n\nThis story is somehow similar to A Shard of Ice, but it disects Geralt's charactervand his relationship with Yennefer much better while avoiding cringe (for the most part). Some .ay say that Essi is yet another female character that falls for Geralt for no reason but I disagree. Her purpose in the story is for Geralt to better understand his feelings for Yennefer and besides she is really well written. Also, the story ends in incredible melancholic way, something that Sapkowski is great at.\n\n**The Sword of Destiny**\n\nAgain - minor detail that seems to be very polish. Soon after Geralt saves Ciri, she sulks and doesn't want to follow him, so he threats that he'd leave her. This is such a polish way to deal with children that don't behave in public - \"I gonna leave you here and mister will come and take you\". But is it only polish or maybe people outside of Poland (or eastern european countries in general) experienced the same thing as kids?\n\n**Something More**\n\nI mentioned previously how The Witcher saga came to be because fans demanded it. Fanbase affected the series also in other ways. Sapkowski after publishing his first witcher story wrote a story about sorceress Visenna that helped people to deal with some monster or other problems (I'm not sure right now). It was completely separate story that has nothing to do with The Witcher. But in the 80s/early 90s comics about Geralt were published, and their authors came up with the idea that Visenna was mother of Geralt. Sapkowski didn\u2019t like the idea initially but ultimately made it official in this story.\n\nNow to the general thoughts about the whole book. I remembered \"The Sword of Destiny\" as much more serious and deeper book than \"The Last Wish\" and I liked it more because of that. But now I'm not sure. I see some cracks (however not gigantic). Sapkowski likes to put the titles of the stories here and there in the text that blends really nicely. But in this book he went overboard especially in the first two short stories. It was almost as if characters used \"bounds of reason\" phrase in every other sentence they spoke. Sapkowski also wanted to tell more serious and complex stories and sometimes it didn't work. Besides \"A Shard of Ice\" story, sometimes dialogues sounds like monologues from Shakespeare dramas. \n\nThat being said, as a teenager I didn't notice that the whole book has overarching ecological theme that connects all the stories. I remembered that novels had it, but not the stories. And Sapkowski approached the problem from many angles. Golden dragon and driads are protecting their kinds from human greed. Zeugl lives in areas polluted by humans. Dopplers show that the only way to survive in the world of humans is to adapt, and since driads are refusing to do so, they're doomed to extinct. Even the dangerous sea won't be spared from human greed. And it's nice that main characters of the story are not always on the right side. Geralt, although he refuses to kill inteligent species, has no problems with killing other monster and Dorregaray points out that every species have a role to play in nature. \n\nEcological theme of the stories is also saturated with melancholy and this sense of longing of the times passed. It's something that always remids mi of LotR. Tolkien also filled his world with melancholy. This melancholy became so strong in the last two stories that when Geralt reunited with Ciri at the end of book I was on the verge of crying. It has been years since I read a book \"emotionally\" rather than intellectually. It's really hard for books to move me in any way. In fact, I don't remembered when it happened the last time. This wasn't be possible if Sapkowski wasn't so good at creating characters. Geralt spend with Ciri just 24h or so and yet their relation was completely believable just after a dozen of pages. That's why their reunion moved me so much. Obviously, it's a very subjective thing, but I thought I share it anyway. \n\nAlso I am curious, at which point of writing short stories that ended up in this book Sapkowski decided to write the whole novel series? It's clear that the last two stories were written as sort of prologue for the saga, but also previous stories seem to prepare characters for what's to come and are sorted in clear chronological order.

        "body": "Another Witcher book and another set of reflections. This time again I'll comment on some fragments of the novel in a non-comprehensive manner because I think it's very fitting (and at the end, I'll explain why) and then I'll summarise the book as a whole.\n\u00a0\n\"The Blood of Elves\" starts with a scene where a crowd listens to one of Dandelion's songs about Geralt and then engages in a discussion first about witcher and then about politics. Sapkowski does several things in this scene and I couldn't help but be stunned by how well he did it. He introduces the main characters of the story, paints the society with all the divisions between certain groups, and explains the most recent political history of the region and much more distant history. Only at the end of the scene, I realised that what I read is one gigantic infodump, but it's conveyed so well, it doesn't feel like an infodump at all. Another thing I've noticed now but didn't see in the past is that Sapkowski started his meditation on myth creation already here not in the last book of the series. Some people claim that Geralt is made up of characters others that he died or that he's never found Ciri, yet all of them are his contemporaries. And already there are several versions of the events. This shows how easily myth separates from history.\n\nLater on, we observe Ciri's training under witchers in Kaer Morhen. I like two things about this section of the novel. First is how Ciri confessed to Triss about her period and how Triss scolded the witchers for lack of imagination and consideration. It's something so natural in this context that's great that Sapkowski put it in the novel. Ciri's reactions are so child-like, she's probably one of the best-written children that I found in literature. And it's not surprising that witchers didn\u2019t think about Ciri's physiology because their interactions with women are usually very short and very intense without any space for deeper conversations. And besides the whole sequence is hilarious.\n\nAnother fragment I want to highlight is a set of scenes where Ciri trains under witchers and Triss. They're pure dialogue without even one sentence of description of what characters do, how they behave, whether are they annoyed or not, etc, yet there's no problem imagining how everything plays out, and dialogues are very natural. It's a sign of true mastery of the craft.\n\nLater on Geralt, Triss and Ciri leave Kaer Morhen to deliver Ciri to Melitele temple. They soon join a company of dwarves led by Yarpen Zigrin who are escorting important delivery. This section of the novel Sapkowski uses to paint complex social interactions between humans and non-humans and within non-humans as well as many flavors of racism (or ethnic discrimination, because I'm not sure if it can be called racism, later on, I explain why I think so). Nilfgaard incites non-humans to rebel against northern kingdoms. While non-humans in Nilfgaards have full rights, empire actions are not selfless. It uses non-humans as a tool to stir chaos in the north. In my opinion, it's a very cynical example of racism. Nilfgaard, despite its laws, views non-humans not as equals but as disposable tools. Non-humans themselves aren't a homogenous group. They disagree on how they should interact with humans. People like Yarpen believe that only through genuine devotion they will be able to gain full rights and respect for humans. The Squirrels think that they have to fight for it, and everyone who disagrees with them has to die. Geralt on the other hand believes that taking sides is the problem because by rebelling against the overwhelming number of humans elves will lose their most precious resource - their young ones and as a consequence the future of their kind. Readers observe this Gordian knot through Ciri's eyes, who, as a child, sees everyone as a friend and can't understand where is the problem. Because there isn't any real problem only prejudice and malice that tainted the minds of adults and led to horrible things in the past. The chapter and with a battle between Squirrels and the convoy, where a lot of non-humans die, and it's revealed that the \"important\" delivery was just a set-up to test Yarpen's loyalty because he's non-human and cannot be fully trusted. And since the majority of his company consists of dwarves, it wouldn't be a big loss if they died during battle. Another flavor of racism.\n\nI spent so much space to describe this fragment because it strays away from the usual depiction of racism in culture and there's good reason for that. Sapkowski again draws from polish history, especially the WW2 period. Nilfgaard inciting non-humans against humans reminds me of nazis doing the same with Ukrainians setting them up against Poles. It led to the terrifying slaughter of Poles by their ukrainian neighbours. This event is still an inflamed wound that taints polish-ukrainian relationships. Poland insists that it was genocide while Ukraine doesn't want to admit any wrongdoing. Now, I don't want to paint Ukrainians as villains. The resentment they had for Poles didn\u2019t come from nowhere. In previous centuries polish nobility were treating ukrainian peasants horribly. Polish noble was \"pan\" - the lord. The problem is that polish nobles treated polish peasants equally badly and the victims of the slaughter were descendants of those peasants, not polish lords. But this is typical of any ethnic cleansing - victims were never responsible for what they were killed. The way Yarpen wants to prove his loyalty to humans and how suspicious they are reminds me of Jews trying to do the same in Poland in the years leading to the war. Yeah, you speak Polish, dress polish, and you're even baptised and attend Sunday's mass in church with us, but you're not *really* polish. And it wasn't only a jewish experience. I can imagine that many nations can relate to that. Finally, Geralt's perspective on the pointlessness of elven young rebelling reminds me of the Warsaw uprising during WW2. The point of the uprising was to liberate Warsaw from nazis by Poles themselves before the Soviets came, so when they eventually did Poles could greet them as equal allies, not liberators. Leaders of the uprising were hoping this move would secure polish independence from the USSR. But it was an idiotic fantasy. The fate of Poland was decided elsewhere and the uprising led only to the decimation of polish youth. The whole generation was lost and Warsaw was leveled to the ground. A lot of people (myself included) consider the Warsaw uprising a war crime, but not committed by nazis but by the leaders of the uprising. It's not a super-popular perspective. Warsaw's uprising is still treated as a heroic act and few remaining veterans as heroes. Sapkowski could choose this perspective as an inspiration for Geralt's worldview but he opted for something much more tragic.\n\nOk, I'm done with this lengthy (and probably boring) history lecture, but before I go further, I just want to explain why I wrote it in the first place. While I disagree with the people who think The Witcher series is Slavic, it's definitely polish as hell. In my opinion, Sapkowski translated parts of polish history into fantasy really well, so my historical lecture isn't necessary to understand the events of the novel, but it may help to understand why Sapkowski wrote them this way. Non-humans call discrimination they experience from human racism, but it is based on different types of ethnic discrimination that English readers might not be familiar with due to different cultural and historical backgrounds. It might be confusing for them why Squirrels are depicted as morally grey at best, why their fight is pointless and tragic, and why some groups of non-humans decided to stand with humans. Well, this is why. Sapkowski could obviously try to please polish readers by using a more cheerful view of polish history to construct his world, where Poles were always noble purely innocent victims etc, but he chose a much more complex and darker version. And I admire him for that.\n\nMoving on. The letter Yennefer sent to Geralt is pure gold. It's soaked in venom so toxic, it would be enough to kill a middle-sized town. You don't call Yennefer \"friend\" not after being with her. It's almost a life sentence.\n\nDuring Dandelion's adventures in Oxenfurt, he briefly mentions the \"bench ghetto\" at the university. This is another reference to polish history, where during the pre-WW2 era Jews had to sit in designated areas of a room during classes. It's a symbol of polish antisemitism of that time, sort of similar to segregation in buses in the US during the 50s.\n\nLater on, Sapkowski presents the gathering of nordic monarchs, who were debating on possible war with Nilfgaard. It's another great scene because from the start Sapkowski emphasises the fact that there's no good side in the upcoming war. Kings treat Cirtians as pawns and don't care about their fate at all and decide to slaughter all non-humans in ghettos to prevent them from getting \"funny ideas\", which is another type of racism. Foltest claims to be tolerant and empathetic towards non-humans, but. Yeah, there's always some kind of \"but\". Yet again, it isn't the purely ideological type of racism, but, I don't know, practical I guess? Foltest wants to get rid of the problem before it even appears, sort of like we are decimating mosquitoes to prevent the spread of malaria. Non-humans are not beings in their own right, but problems that need solutions. It's dehumanising.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of the novel, where Ciri meets Yennefer for the first time. I really like that they start as sort of rivals for Geralt's attention. Even if they weren't aware of that Nenneke diagnosed their dynamic correctly, which probably helped them get along with each other much faster. Their relationship is initially cold but slowly gains some tenderness and peaks when Yennefer calls Ciri's daughter after a failed lesson. I don't know why, but these moments of kindness towards Ciri always get me. They get me hard. I don't know if it's because of nostalgia for the series or simply because it's so damn good.\n\nOk, I'm done with my impressions, now it's time for a summary. After so many praises I've written above, one may think that \"The Blood of Elves\" is a masterpiece. Everything is superb: writing, dialogues, characters, and themes, but the question is: \"Is it a great novel?\" Well, I have mixed feelings about it, let me explain, why. Initially, I wrote that discussing separate fragments of the books seems fitting. It's because \"The Blood of Elves\" works at the level of fragments and chapters, but it doesn't work as a novel.\n\nIt starts well. The reader has a sense of direction: Geralt brings Ciri to Kaer Morhen, trains her, lets Triss examine her, and finally decides to bring her to Melitele temple. Chapter 4 ends when the protagonists are in the middle of the road to the temple and suddenly in chapter 5 Geralt is on a boat setting a trap for people who look for him and Ciri. What? How? From the first chapter we know that Rience is after Ciri and finding him would be the natural direction for the novel after Geralt leaves Ciri with Nenneke. The problem is, that Sapkowski cut the whole chunk of the novel. Or at least he concluded that he had nothing interesting to write about this part of the journey. But because of that the rest of the novel also falls apart. The scene on the boat is entertaining enough due to Sapkowski's humor and mastery in writing dialogues but ultimately feels redundant. The only point of it is for Geralt to catch a trail, which he thinks he does with Temeria thugs. But during a conversation between Dijkstra and Jaskier, the master of spies reiterates the scene and gives additional, much more relevant context. So the scene of the boat could be cut completely. Later on, we get a bunch of scenes when big players of the world are discussing politics. For me, at least, those scenes were interesting and necessary for the plot, but they also cover the fact that Sapkowski wrote only a few more pages in the main plotline. And then we get the chapter with Ciri and Yennefer, which is great on its own, but it isn't connected to the rest of the novel. It's called a chapter, not an epilogue so it should be an integral part of the story. But I don't see the reason why (actually I see and explain in a moment) it couldn't be the first chapter of the next novel. It would fit them perfectly.\n\nNow, I don't want to sound like \"The Blood of Elves\" and huge step back from the short stories. There's a lot of good here. Sapkowski grew as a writer and the prose in his first novel surpasses even the best pieces from short stories. He utilizes several writing styles, especially in those fragments of fictional books at the beginning of each chapter and in dialogues to give each character a distinct way of speaking (I wonder if the translation gives him justice). The novel as a whole works well as an introduction for the saga - it presents the first pieces of lore, sets up pawns on the political board, and most importantly serves as a reminder of the good times for Ciri and readers as well, when all hell is let loose in next parts. I think, Ciri here builds core memories of the last time when she felt safe and loved and was just a child. And that's why the last chapter also fits here (loosely but still) not in the next novel: as chapters with other witchers help Ciri to develop good memories.\n\nSo, is it a good novel? Depends on reader preferences, I guess. I can totally understand people who\u2019d complain about the structure of the book, but for me, there\u2019s so much good stuff inside that I couldn\u2019t care less. But, obviously, it\u2019s a very subjective opinion.\n\nOk, I think it's more than enough writing. Sorry for such a long post. I hope someone will read it and find it at least mildly interesting. And I'd be happy to hear your opinion on The Witcher series."

Also, being a Nineties Edgelord means that I\u2019m forty-three in 2024 and am the kind of person who tells kids to get off his lawn.\n\nMy dark and *edgy* lawn.\n\nWith spikes.\n\nAnd lava pits.\n\nOh yeah.\n\n*Dark*.\n\nIndeed, in the words of Principle Seymour Skinner, \u201cAm I out of touch? No, it is the children who are wrong.\u201d It\u2019s just the subject of which \u2018the children\u2019 are wrong about is grimdark. For the purposes of this essay, I\u2019m going to say that grimdark is defined as dark fantasy and science fiction that is deliberately designed to push the envelope. Dark fantasy and science fiction that is deliberately cynical, horrifying, and shocking. The kind of thing that would be parody if it wasn\u2019t treated dead serious. It\u2019s not an exact definition but it\u2019s my essay, so hush.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, I was recently shocked, SHOCKED, to find out that this is not something that is inherently considered to be a good thing. It was madness, it was blasphemy, and it was Sparta. One thread on a popular fantasy forum for the \u201cedgiest\u201d books and I listed one of my favorite authors only to be downvoted to oblivion because they assumed I was being insulting. I was like, \u201cNo, who would want to read a book without any edge to it? That\u2019s like a bowling ball without a liquid center.\u201d Which is my second Simpsons quote in this essay for some reason.\n\nI mean, I would happily read (and often do read) stories with no edge. In addition to Cthulhu Mythos, Anne Rice, Berserk, George R.R. Martin, Poppy Z. Brite, and Joe Abercrombie, I love Dragonlance, Wheel of Time, as well as the Forgotten Realms. The comfort food of fantasy. Even then, my favorite characters are Kitiara uth Matar, Raistlin Majere, and Artemis Entreri. My favorite Wheel of Time romance is Rand and Lanfear. In the words of Lego Batman, \u201cDarkness. No parents. Continued darkness. (More darkness, get it?)\u201d And there ain\u2019t nothing wrong with that.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with liking grimdark. Fantasy and science fiction exists to provide us a safe space for being able to explore concepts as well as ideas that we can\u2019t experience (or wouldn\u2019t want to) in real life. I would absolutely never want to live in Mad Max\u2019s Australia or in HP Lovecraft\u2019s Arkham but both would obvious influences on my *Cthulhu Armageddon* books. Westeros became the juggernaut that it was because it was a contrast to so much \u201cfeel good\u201d fiction about heroes always saving the day with little apparent cost to their actions.\n\nBut what is the appeal? Why do people want to enjoy places like *Cyberpunk 2077*\u2018s Night City or *Dark Souls*\u2018 Lordan? That\u2019s because we\u2019re inherently drawn to the extremes of experience. Whether the zombie apocalypse of *The Walking Dead* or more personal stories like The Witcher where systemic corruption means that any heroics done by people like Geralt are probably futile (except worthwhile for the one or two people he might save). It\u2019s because we want to see how people hold up against extremes and know how things might be without a safety net.\n\nAuthors should not be ashamed of pushing the envelope and deliberately writing darker stories that are counterbalances to happier ones. The reason *Hamlet* is remembered as the classic it is, is because Hamlet utterly screws up and his attempt to avenge his father makes everything objectively worse for everyone (including himself). I wouldn\u2019t want to read evil triumphing over good or the failure of heroes against obscene odds. However, that happening on occasion is something that makes stories more memorable as well as interesting. Some of my favorite elements of the First Law Trilogy are the acknowledgement that sometimes people don\u2019t grow, don\u2019t change, or even get worse.\n\nI\u2019m also a fan of protagonists who, themselves, are kind of terrible. Geralt and Batman are both guys who struggle uphill against societies that are absolutely awful. However, some protagonists are fun even though they\u2019re absolutely awful themselves. Takashi Kovacs is only mildly better than the people he fights and does some truly reprehensible things in the Altered Carbon books. I mentioned how enjoyable it was to follow Raistlin Majere is when he\u2019s trying to be a god by murdering his way to apotheosis. Judge Dredd is the worst kind of authoritarian but that\u2019s part of the appeal.\n\nAs a fan of cyberpunk, noir, horror, and fantasy/science fiction, my tastes tend to skew to the existentially dreadful. I think the Dark Tower movie was absolute garbage because it reinvisions Roland as the protector of children when his single most defining moment in The Gunslinger was the fact that he\u2019d let a child die if it meant he could get himself closer to the Tower. Some people find this to be absolutely childish and a fourteen year old\u2019s view of darkness and moral ambiguity. Absolutely. Fourteen years old, 1994 for me, is when I found a lot of things to be fun. I still find them fun at forty-three in 2024. Things that inspired tabletop RPG characters of mine named Lord Grimshadow Darkwulf the Cyborg Vampire with his ex-black ops soldier prostitute werewolf girlfriend based on X-23 (my wife's PC)\n\nSo never feel ashamed of being an edgelord.\n\nEdge is where the setting sun meets the encroaching night.\n\nAnd sometimes the reverse.\n\nTLDR: Middle aged man defends silly interests in his fantasy/scifi."

        "body": "As much as I love the Witcher properties, and as cool as the dual swords aesthetic is, it has always bothered me that professional monster hunters don't ever seem to use weapons that are actually used for hunting. Especially considering it's a well-known fact that being a witcher is a really dangerous profession. And maintaining the kind of equipment that can stand up to the abuse of tussling close with monsters is ridiculously expensive. There's a reason Geralt is always broke. From a simple economic and personal safety standpoint, it only makes sense to at least try to use distance as a weapon. \n\nNow, the same strength and dexterity that makes Witchers so deadly in close combat would apply even more so to ranged weapons, like 1.) Bows 2.) Slings and 3.) Spears/Darts. Let's show some numbers to demonstrate. \n\n1.) A 200 lbs warbow is entirely shootable by an un-augmented human, and with approximately 80-100 gram arrows it can travel about 60 meters per second. Thats 180 joules of kinetic energy and 6 newtons of momentum. Elephants have been killed by arrows weaker in both of those categories. What prevented a lot of medieval archers from using bows of that size is the fact that even the strongest archer could only shoot that strength of bow about 5 times. A witcher would not have this problem. 3 rapid fire shots from a warbow will be taking down pretty much any beast that isn't a dragon or requires a special hex or chemical to kill it. Warbows and war arrows aren't exactly cheap, but they're significantly cheaper than armor and swords. \n\n2.) The sling. This is where a witcher's strength and dexterity would really shine in terrifying ways. Balearic style slingers can hurl bullet projectiles weighing 30-50 grams up to 65 m/s. I have no practical idea how much stronger or faster a witcher is than a sling soldier, but if I'm being incredibly conservative and saying that he could sling a bullet weighing 75 grams up to 90 m/s, that would be lethal levels of power. About 300 joules of energy and almost 7 newtons of momentum. Large game animals have been taken with numbers smaller than these. \n\n3.) Professional javelin throwers can release an 800 gram javelin at speeds of about 32 m/s. Let's again be fairly conservative and say that a witcher could release a war dart about 1 kilogram in weight about 45 m/s. That's over a thousand joules and 45 newtons of momentum. Put a wide spear point on the end of that and it's taking down pretty much anything on the continent. About 700 joules is the point at which a projectile actually imparts kinetic energy enough to cause hydrostatic shock. Once again, darts are pretty cheap compared to swords and armor. \n\nI know that some jobs require more tactics than simply doing physical damage, but the vast majority of a witcher's targets seem to be just as vulnerable to physics as everything else. And a witcher can essentially cheat the physics of the human body."

        "body": "I've finished the second short story collection pretty fast because it was quite short, and, well, I couldn't stop reading. It was a good idea that I abandoned the idea of comparing OG with translation. This time, I could fully commit myself to experiencing the story. \n\nI start with sharing some thoughts about each story (not in a comprehensive manner, I just want to highlight some details that I found interesting, funny or worth of explaining) and afterwards I write general summary of book.\n\n**The Bounds of Reason**\n\nFor those that don't know what was the deal with the shoemaker who tried to poison the dragon - story is inspired by the polish legend of the dragon of Wawel. Wawel is a castle located in the city of Cracow. The story goes as usual in those that involve dragons. There's kingdom and dragon that threatened it, and someone had to kill it. But in this legend, the dragon wasn't killed by a knight in shining armour, but by clever shoemaker who came with the idea of sheep corpse filled with sulfur. Dragon ate the sheep and felt so thirsty that he drank water from river until he burst. This is quite a prevalent motif in polish legends - problems are often solved in a clever way without any violence. In the legend of Master Twardowski, which inspired Hearts of Stone DLC to The Witcher 3, Twardowski tried to trick the devil by making a contract where the devil could take Twardowski's soul only in Rome. But obviously, Twardowski had no intention of going to Rome. However, the devil was smarter and caught Twardowski in the inn called Rome.\n\nI don't know how the name of the shoemaker was translated into English, but in Polish he was named Kozojed, and if replace \"d\" with \"b\", his name would mean Goatfucker. I highly doubt that it was a coincidence on Sapkowski's side.\n\nAlso Borch \"Three Jackdaws\" is my favourite character from the short stories and I was sad that he didn\u2019t make another appearance. \n\n**A Shard of Ice**\n\nI have no clue what went wrong here. This story was insufferable cringefest. Even the dialogues, so masterful in any other Sapkowski's work, here were hard to read. Geralt is as exalted as characters from Twilight or something like that. His miserable suicide attempt was cherry on top. Guess Sapkowski was drunk while writing this story.\n\nAlso Yennefer is extremely toxic character. Nowadays, after so many movie or books stories where toxic relationships are romanticised, creation like that may rise some brows. I guess that Sapkowski wanted to create imperfect, yet strong and magnetic female character that strayed away from princess archetype as far as possible. Besides, later on Yennefer gains more redeeming qualities like her motherly love for Ciri, which makes her really complex.\n\n**Ethernal Flame**\n\nProbably the funniest witcher story Sapkowski ever wrote (maybe besides Something Ends, Something Begins, but this one is non-canonical). Sapkowski prior to becoming full-time writer was working in comerce and have a degree in economy and knew very well how to make fun of it.\n\n**A Little Sacrifice**\n\nThis story is somehow similar to A Shard of Ice, but it disects Geralt's charactervand his relationship with Yennefer much better while avoiding cringe (for the most part). Some .ay say that Essi is yet another female character that falls for Geralt for no reason but I disagree. Her purpose in the story is for Geralt to better understand his feelings for Yennefer and besides she is really well written. Also, the story ends in incredible melancholic way, something that Sapkowski is great at.\n\n**The Sword of Destiny**\n\nAgain - minor detail that seems to be very polish. Soon after Geralt saves Ciri, she sulks and doesn't want to follow him, so he threats that he'd leave her. This is such a polish way to deal with children that don't behave in public - \"I gonna leave you here and mister will come and take you\". But is it only polish or maybe people outside of Poland (or eastern european countries in general) experienced the same thing as kids?\n\n**Something More**\n\nI mentioned previously how The Witcher saga came to be because fans demanded it. Fanbase affected the series also in other ways. Sapkowski after publishing his first witcher story wrote a story about sorceress Visenna that helped people to deal with some monster or other problems (I'm not sure right now). It was completely separate story that has nothing to do with The Witcher. But in the 80s/early 90s comics about Geralt were published, and their authors came up with the idea that Visenna was mother of Geralt. Sapkowski didn\u2019t like the idea initially but ultimately made it official in this story.\n\nNow to the general thoughts about the whole book. I remembered \"The Sword of Destiny\" as much more serious and deeper book than \"The Last Wish\" and I liked it more because of that. But now I'm not sure. I see some cracks (however not gigantic). Sapkowski likes to put the titles of the stories here and there in the text that blends really nicely. But in this book he went overboard especially in the first two short stories. It was almost as if characters used \"bounds of reason\" phrase in every other sentence they spoke. Sapkowski also wanted to tell more serious and complex stories and sometimes it didn't work. Besides \"A Shard of Ice\" story, sometimes dialogues sounds like monologues from Shakespeare dramas. \n\nThat being said, as a teenager I didn't notice that the whole book has overarching ecological theme that connects all the stories. I remembered that novels had it, but not the stories. And Sapkowski approached the problem from many angles. Golden dragon and driads are protecting their kinds from human greed. Zeugl lives in areas polluted by humans. Dopplers show that the only way to survive in the world of humans is to adapt, and since driads are refusing to do so, they're doomed to extinct. Even the dangerous sea won't be spared from human greed. And it's nice that main characters of the story are not always on the right side. Geralt, although he refuses to kill inteligent species, has no problems with killing other monster and Dorregaray points out that every species have a role to play in nature. \n\nEcological theme of the stories is also saturated with melancholy and this sense of longing of the times passed. It's something that always remids mi of LotR. Tolkien also filled his world with melancholy. This melancholy became so strong in the last two stories that when Geralt reunited with Ciri at the end of book I was on the verge of crying. It has been years since I read a book \"emotionally\" rather than intellectually. It's really hard for books to move me in any way. In fact, I don't remembered when it happened the last time. This wasn't be possible if Sapkowski wasn't so good at creating characters. Geralt spend with Ciri just 24h or so and yet their relation was completely believable just after a dozen of pages. That's why their reunion moved me so much. Obviously, it's a very subjective thing, but I thought I share it anyway. \n\nAlso I am curious, at which point of writing short stories that ended up in this book Sapkowski decided to write the whole novel series? It's clear that the last two stories were written as sort of prologue for the saga, but also previous stories seem to prepare characters for what's to come and are sorted in clear chronological order.

        "body": "Another Witcher book and another set of reflections. This time again I'll comment on some fragments of the novel in a non-comprehensive manner because I think it's very fitting (and at the end, I'll explain why) and then I'll summarise the book as a whole.\n\u00a0\n\"The Blood of Elves\" starts with a scene where a crowd listens to one of Dandelion's songs about Geralt and then engages in a discussion first about witcher and then about politics. Sapkowski does several things in this scene and I couldn't help but be stunned by how well he did it. He introduces the main characters of the story, paints the society with all the divisions between certain groups, and explains the most recent political history of the region and much more distant history. Only at the end of the scene, I realised that what I read is one gigantic infodump, but it's conveyed so well, it doesn't feel like an infodump at all. Another thing I've noticed now but didn't see in the past is that Sapkowski started his meditation on myth creation already here not in the last book of the series. Some people claim that Geralt is made up of characters others that he died or that he's never found Ciri, yet all of them are his contemporaries. And already there are several versions of the events. This shows how easily myth separates from history.\n\nLater on, we observe Ciri's training under witchers in Kaer Morhen. I like two things about this section of the novel. First is how Ciri confessed to Triss about her period and how Triss scolded the witchers for lack of imagination and consideration. It's something so natural in this context that's great that Sapkowski put it in the novel. Ciri's reactions are so child-like, she's probably one of the best-written children that I found in literature. And it's not surprising that witchers didn\u2019t think about Ciri's physiology because their interactions with women are usually very short and very intense without any space for deeper conversations. And besides the whole sequence is hilarious.\n\nAnother fragment I want to highlight is a set of scenes where Ciri trains under witchers and Triss. They're pure dialogue without even one sentence of description of what characters do, how they behave, whether are they annoyed or not, etc, yet there's no problem imagining how everything plays out, and dialogues are very natural. It's a sign of true mastery of the craft.\n\nLater on Geralt, Triss and Ciri leave Kaer Morhen to deliver Ciri to Melitele temple. They soon join a company of dwarves led by Yarpen Zigrin who are escorting important delivery. This section of the novel Sapkowski uses to paint complex social interactions between humans and non-humans and within non-humans as well as many flavors of racism (or ethnic discrimination, because I'm not sure if it can be called racism, later on, I explain why I think so). Nilfgaard incites non-humans to rebel against northern kingdoms. While non-humans in Nilfgaards have full rights, empire actions are not selfless. It uses non-humans as a tool to stir chaos in the north. In my opinion, it's a very cynical example of racism. Nilfgaard, despite its laws, views non-humans not as equals but as disposable tools. Non-humans themselves aren't a homogenous group. They disagree on how they should interact with humans. People like Yarpen believe that only through genuine devotion they will be able to gain full rights and respect for humans. The Squirrels think that they have to fight for it, and everyone who disagrees with them has to die. Geralt on the other hand believes that taking sides is the problem because by rebelling against the overwhelming number of humans elves will lose their most precious resource - their young ones and as a consequence the future of their kind. Readers observe this Gordian knot through Ciri's eyes, who, as a child, sees everyone as a friend and can't understand where is the problem. Because there isn't any real problem only prejudice and malice that tainted the minds of adults and led to horrible things in the past. The chapter and with a battle between Squirrels and the convoy, where a lot of non-humans die, and it's revealed that the \"important\" delivery was just a set-up to test Yarpen's loyalty because he's non-human and cannot be fully trusted. And since the majority of his company consists of dwarves, it wouldn't be a big loss if they died during battle. Another flavor of racism.\n\nI spent so much space to describe this fragment because it strays away from the usual depiction of racism in culture and there's good reason for that. Sapkowski again draws from polish history, especially the WW2 period. Nilfgaard inciting non-humans against humans reminds me of nazis doing the same with Ukrainians setting them up against Poles. It led to the terrifying slaughter of Poles by their ukrainian neighbours. This event is still an inflamed wound that taints polish-ukrainian relationships. Poland insists that it was genocide while Ukraine doesn't want to admit any wrongdoing. Now, I don't want to paint Ukrainians as villains. The resentment they had for Poles didn\u2019t come from nowhere. In previous centuries polish nobility were treating ukrainian peasants horribly. Polish noble was \"pan\" - the lord. The problem is that polish nobles treated polish peasants equally badly and the victims of the slaughter were descendants of those peasants, not polish lords. But this is typical of any ethnic cleansing - victims were never responsible for what they were killed. The way Yarpen wants to prove his loyalty to humans and how suspicious they are reminds me of Jews trying to do the same in Poland in the years leading to the war. Yeah, you speak Polish, dress polish, and you're even baptised and attend Sunday's mass in church with us, but you're not *really* polish. And it wasn't only a jewish experience. I can imagine that many nations can relate to that. Finally, Geralt's perspective on the pointlessness of elven young rebelling reminds me of the Warsaw uprising during WW2. The point of the uprising was to liberate Warsaw from nazis by Poles themselves before the Soviets came, so when they eventually did Poles could greet them as equal allies, not liberators. Leaders of the uprising were hoping this move would secure polish independence from the USSR. But it was an idiotic fantasy. The fate of Poland was decided elsewhere and the uprising led only to the decimation of polish youth. The whole generation was lost and Warsaw was leveled to the ground. A lot of people (myself included) consider the Warsaw uprising a war crime, but not committed by nazis but by the leaders of the uprising. It's not a super-popular perspective. Warsaw's uprising is still treated as a heroic act and few remaining veterans as heroes. Sapkowski could choose this perspective as an inspiration for Geralt's worldview but he opted for something much more tragic.\n\nOk, I'm done with this lengthy (and probably boring) history lecture, but before I go further, I just want to explain why I wrote it in the first place. While I disagree with the people who think The Witcher series is Slavic, it's definitely polish as hell. In my opinion, Sapkowski translated parts of polish history into fantasy really well, so my historical lecture isn't necessary to understand the events of the novel, but it may help to understand why Sapkowski wrote them this way. Non-humans call discrimination they experience from human racism, but it is based on different types of ethnic discrimination that English readers might not be familiar with due to different cultural and historical backgrounds. It might be confusing for them why Squirrels are depicted as morally grey at best, why their fight is pointless and tragic, and why some groups of non-humans decided to stand with humans. Well, this is why. Sapkowski could obviously try to please polish readers by using a more cheerful view of polish history to construct his world, where Poles were always noble purely innocent victims etc, but he chose a much more complex and darker version. And I admire him for that.\n\nMoving on. The letter Yennefer sent to Geralt is pure gold. It's soaked in venom so toxic, it would be enough to kill a middle-sized town. You don't call Yennefer \"friend\" not after being with her. It's almost a life sentence.\n\nDuring Dandelion's adventures in Oxenfurt, he briefly mentions the \"bench ghetto\" at the university. This is another reference to polish history, where during the pre-WW2 era Jews had to sit in designated areas of a room during classes. It's a symbol of polish antisemitism of that time, sort of similar to segregation in buses in the US during the 50s.\n\nLater on, Sapkowski presents the gathering of nordic monarchs, who were debating on possible war with Nilfgaard. It's another great scene because from the start Sapkowski emphasises the fact that there's no good side in the upcoming war. Kings treat Cirtians as pawns and don't care about their fate at all and decide to slaughter all non-humans in ghettos to prevent them from getting \"funny ideas\", which is another type of racism. Foltest claims to be tolerant and empathetic towards non-humans, but. Yeah, there's always some kind of \"but\". Yet again, it isn't the purely ideological type of racism, but, I don't know, practical I guess? Foltest wants to get rid of the problem before it even appears, sort of like we are decimating mosquitoes to prevent the spread of malaria. Non-humans are not beings in their own right, but problems that need solutions. It's dehumanising.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of the novel, where Ciri meets Yennefer for the first time. I really like that they start as sort of rivals for Geralt's attention. Even if they weren't aware of that Nenneke diagnosed their dynamic correctly, which probably helped them get along with each other much faster. Their relationship is initially cold but slowly gains some tenderness and peaks when Yennefer calls Ciri's daughter after a failed lesson. I don't know why, but these moments of kindness towards Ciri always get me. They get me hard. I don't know if it's because of nostalgia for the series or simply because it's so damn good.\n\nOk, I'm done with my impressions, now it's time for a summary. After so many praises I've written above, one may think that \"The Blood of Elves\" is a masterpiece. Everything is superb: writing, dialogues, characters, and themes, but the question is: \"Is it a great novel?\" Well, I have mixed feelings about it, let me explain, why. Initially, I wrote that discussing separate fragments of the books seems fitting. It's because \"The Blood of Elves\" works at the level of fragments and chapters, but it doesn't work as a novel.\n\nIt starts well. The reader has a sense of direction: Geralt brings Ciri to Kaer Morhen, trains her, lets Triss examine her, and finally decides to bring her to Melitele temple. Chapter 4 ends when the protagonists are in the middle of the road to the temple and suddenly in chapter 5 Geralt is on a boat setting a trap for people who look for him and Ciri. What? How? From the first chapter we know that Rience is after Ciri and finding him would be the natural direction for the novel after Geralt leaves Ciri with Nenneke. The problem is, that Sapkowski cut the whole chunk of the novel. Or at least he concluded that he had nothing interesting to write about this part of the journey. But because of that the rest of the novel also falls apart. The scene on the boat is entertaining enough due to Sapkowski's humor and mastery in writing dialogues but ultimately feels redundant. The only point of it is for Geralt to catch a trail, which he thinks he does with Temeria thugs. But during a conversation between Dijkstra and Jaskier, the master of spies reiterates the scene and gives additional, much more relevant context. So the scene of the boat could be cut completely. Later on, we get a bunch of scenes when big players of the world are discussing politics. For me, at least, those scenes were interesting and necessary for the plot, but they also cover the fact that Sapkowski wrote only a few more pages in the main plotline. And then we get the chapter with Ciri and Yennefer, which is great on its own, but it isn't connected to the rest of the novel. It's called a chapter, not an epilogue so it should be an integral part of the story. But I don't see the reason why (actually I see and explain in a moment) it couldn't be the first chapter of the next novel. It would fit them perfectly.\n\nNow, I don't want to sound like \"The Blood of Elves\" and huge step back from the short stories. There's a lot of good here. Sapkowski grew as a writer and the prose in his first novel surpasses even the best pieces from short stories. He utilizes several writing styles, especially in those fragments of fictional books at the beginning of each chapter and in dialogues to give each character a distinct way of speaking (I wonder if the translation gives him justice). The novel as a whole works well as an introduction for the saga - it presents the first pieces of lore, sets up pawns on the political board, and most importantly serves as a reminder of the good times for Ciri and readers as well, when all hell is let loose in next parts. I think, Ciri here builds core memories of the last time when she felt safe and loved and was just a child. And that's why the last chapter also fits here (loosely but still) not in the next novel: as chapters with other witchers help Ciri to develop good memories.\n\nSo, is it a good novel? Depends on reader preferences, I guess. I can totally understand people who\u2019d complain about the structure of the book, but for me, there\u2019s so much good stuff inside that I couldn\u2019t care less. But, obviously, it\u2019s a very subjective opinion.\n\nOk, I think it's more than enough writing. Sorry for such a long post. I hope someone will read it and find it at least mildly interesting. And I'd be happy to hear your opinion on The Witcher series."

        "body": "Another Witcher book and another set of reflections. This time again I'll comment on some fragments of the novel in a non-comprehensive manner because I think it's very fitting (and at the end, I'll explain why) and then I'll summarise the book as a whole.\n\u00a0\n\"The Blood of Elves\" starts with a scene where a crowd listens to one of Dandelion's songs about Geralt and then engages in a discussion first about witcher and then about politics. Sapkowski does several things in this scene and I couldn't help but be stunned by how well he did it. He introduces the main characters of the story, paints the society with all the divisions between certain groups, and explains the most recent political history of the region and much more distant history. Only at the end of the scene, I realised that what I read is one gigantic infodump, but it's conveyed so well, it doesn't feel like an infodump at all. Another thing I've noticed now but didn't see in the past is that Sapkowski started his meditation on myth creation already here not in the last book of the series. Some people claim that Geralt is made up of characters others that he died or that he's never found Ciri, yet all of them are his contemporaries. And already there are several versions of the events. This shows how easily myth separates from history.\n\nLater on, we observe Ciri's training under witchers in Kaer Morhen. I like two things about this section of the novel. First is how Ciri confessed to Triss about her period and how Triss scolded the witchers for lack of imagination and consideration. It's something so natural in this context that's great that Sapkowski put it in the novel. Ciri's reactions are so child-like, she's probably one of the best-written children that I found in literature. And it's not surprising that witchers didn\u2019t think about Ciri's physiology because their interactions with women are usually very short and very intense without any space for deeper conversations. And besides the whole sequence is hilarious.\n\nAnother fragment I want to highlight is a set of scenes where Ciri trains under witchers and Triss. They're pure dialogue without even one sentence of description of what characters do, how they behave, whether are they annoyed or not, etc, yet there's no problem imagining how everything plays out, and dialogues are very natural. It's a sign of true mastery of the craft.\n\nLater on Geralt, Triss and Ciri leave Kaer Morhen to deliver Ciri to Melitele temple. They soon join a company of dwarves led by Yarpen Zigrin who are escorting important delivery. This section of the novel Sapkowski uses to paint complex social interactions between humans and non-humans and within non-humans as well as many flavors of racism (or ethnic discrimination, because I'm not sure if it can be called racism, later on, I explain why I think so). Nilfgaard incites non-humans to rebel against northern kingdoms. While non-humans in Nilfgaards have full rights, empire actions are not selfless. It uses non-humans as a tool to stir chaos in the north. In my opinion, it's a very cynical example of racism. Nilfgaard, despite its laws, views non-humans not as equals but as disposable tools. Non-humans themselves aren't a homogenous group. They disagree on how they should interact with humans. People like Yarpen believe that only through genuine devotion they will be able to gain full rights and respect for humans. The Squirrels think that they have to fight for it, and everyone who disagrees with them has to die. Geralt on the other hand believes that taking sides is the problem because by rebelling against the overwhelming number of humans elves will lose their most precious resource - their young ones and as a consequence the future of their kind. Readers observe this Gordian knot through Ciri's eyes, who, as a child, sees everyone as a friend and can't understand where is the problem. Because there isn't any real problem only prejudice and malice that tainted the minds of adults and led to horrible things in the past. The chapter and with a battle between Squirrels and the convoy, where a lot of non-humans die, and it's revealed that the \"important\" delivery was just a set-up to test Yarpen's loyalty because he's non-human and cannot be fully trusted. And since the majority of his company consists of dwarves, it wouldn't be a big loss if they died during battle. Another flavor of racism.\n\nI spent so much space to describe this fragment because it strays away from the usual depiction of racism in culture and there's good reason for that. Sapkowski again draws from polish history, especially the WW2 period. Nilfgaard inciting non-humans against humans reminds me of nazis doing the same with Ukrainians setting them up against Poles. It led to the terrifying slaughter of Poles by their ukrainian neighbours. This event is still an inflamed wound that taints polish-ukrainian relationships. Poland insists that it was genocide while Ukraine doesn't want to admit any wrongdoing. Now, I don't want to paint Ukrainians as villains. The resentment they had for Poles didn\u2019t come from nowhere. In previous centuries polish nobility were treating ukrainian peasants horribly. Polish noble was \"pan\" - the lord. The problem is that polish nobles treated polish peasants equally badly and the victims of the slaughter were descendants of those peasants, not polish lords. But this is typical of any ethnic cleansing - victims were never responsible for what they were killed. The way Yarpen wants to prove his loyalty to humans and how suspicious they are reminds me of Jews trying to do the same in Poland in the years leading to the war. Yeah, you speak Polish, dress polish, and you're even baptised and attend Sunday's mass in church with us, but you're not *really* polish. And it wasn't only a jewish experience.

I don't know if it's because of nostalgia for the series or simply because it's so damn good.\n\nOk, I'm done with my impressions, now it's time for a summary. After so many praises I've written above, one may think that \"The Blood of Elves\" is a masterpiece. Everything is superb: writing, dialogues, characters, and themes, but the question is: \"Is it a great novel?\" Well, I have mixed feelings about it, let me explain, why. Initially, I wrote that discussing separate fragments of the books seems fitting. It's because \"The Blood of Elves\" works at the level of fragments and chapters, but it doesn't work as a novel.\n\nIt starts well. The reader has a sense of direction: Geralt brings Ciri to Kaer Morhen, trains her, lets Triss examine her, and finally decides to bring her to Melitele temple. Chapter 4 ends when the protagonists are in the middle of the road to the temple and suddenly in chapter 5 Geralt is on a boat setting a trap for people who look for him and Ciri. What? How? From the first chapter we know that Rience is after Ciri and finding him would be the natural direction for the novel after Geralt leaves Ciri with Nenneke. The problem is, that Sapkowski cut the whole chunk of the novel. Or at least he concluded that he had nothing interesting to write about this part of the journey. But because of that the rest of the novel also falls apart. The scene on the boat is entertaining enough due to Sapkowski's humor and mastery in writing dialogues but ultimately feels redundant. The only point of it is for Geralt to catch a trail, which he thinks he does with Temeria thugs. But during a conversation between Dijkstra and Jaskier, the master of spies reiterates the scene and gives additional, much more relevant context. So the scene of the boat could be cut completely. Later on, we get a bunch of scenes when big players of the world are discussing politics. For me, at least, those scenes were interesting and necessary for the plot, but they also cover the fact that Sapkowski wrote only a few more pages in the main plotline. And then we get the chapter with Ciri and Yennefer, which is great on its own, but it isn't connected to the rest of the novel. It's called a chapter, not an epilogue so it should be an integral part of the story. But I don't see the reason why (actually I see and explain in a moment) it couldn't be the first chapter of the next novel. It would fit them perfectly.\n\nNow, I don't want to sound like \"The Blood of Elves\" and huge step back from the short stories. There's a lot of good here. Sapkowski grew as a writer and the prose in his first novel surpasses even the best pieces from short stories. He utilizes several writing styles, especially in those fragments of fictional books at the beginning of each chapter and in dialogues to give each character a distinct way of speaking (I wonder if the translation gives him justice). The novel as a whole works well as an introduction for the saga - it presents the first pieces of lore, sets up pawns on the political board, and most importantly serves as a reminder of the good times for Ciri and readers as well, when all hell is let loose in next parts. I think, Ciri here builds core memories of the last time when she felt safe and loved and was just a child. And that's why the last chapter also fits here (loosely but still) not in the next novel: as chapters with other witchers help Ciri to develop good memories.\n\nSo, is it a good novel? Depends on reader preferences, I guess. I can totally understand people who\u2019d complain about the structure of the book, but for me, there\u2019s so much good stuff inside that I couldn\u2019t care less. But, obviously, it\u2019s a very subjective opinion.\n\nOk, I think it's more than enough writing. Sorry for such a long post. I hope someone will read it and find it at least mildly interesting. And I'd be happy to hear your opinion on The Witcher series."

Under the guise of a classic fantasy story, Bond masterfully weaves a compelling and powerful story that encloses a great message about fighting against the roles established by the system.\n\nMaddileh is a knight; a work usually done by men, a circumstance that brings much contempt and bad-mouthing towards her. Something more difficult to deal than killing dragons; but Maddileh has developed a thick skin toward those.  \nWhen a minor infraction puts a stain on her honour, there's no other way to redeem it than retrieving the Fireborne Blade from the White Lady, a legendary dragon that no man has ever defeated; she might die trying, but it is how you get your coin. Together with a peculiar squire, she will delve into the Lady's demesne, hoping to not end like the ones that preceded her.\n\nIn the relatively short length of this novella, Bond mixes together Maddileh's own story together with fragments of\u00a0*The Demise and Demesne of Dragons*, a book accounting the reality behind this dragon-slaying role played by the knights, the struggles and the trickeries that many times happened on the process. Not only that, but with Maddileh, Bond firstly creates a character that is fighting against the rigidity of genre roles of her world, but also has some twists that elevate the story even more.\n\nBond's prose accompanies perfectly the story, gorgeously describing not only the glamorous parts but also portraying the beauty on the fearful details. Pacing is absolutely on the spot, accompanying the story and alternating between the story and the more lore related chapters, which fell as short stories inside the novella.\n\n*The Fireborne Blade*\u00a0is an excellent novella, and a great example of how to insufflate new life onto classic stories twisting tropes and introducing elements that were not explored previously. I loved this book, and I'll absolutely read\u00a0*The Bloodless Prince*, because I can't wait to see how Bond ties this novella with the next one."

        "body": "  Hi Fantasy Folks! I am back with a few more reviews. What I have been doing for the most part lately is reading a series or trilogy and mixing in standalones in between to vary things up. Although standalones particularly in fantasy can be harder to come by than other genres. I am trying to read some of the favourites of the genre and newer stuff that has popped up more recently. \n\nLowest reviewed to highest.\n\n**Shadows Linger by Glen Cook**\n\nBasic Outline- Book two of The Black Company. After the epic confrontation at the end of the last book Croaker and company have been sent far east to continue hunting down rebels. Little do they know that back in the west some familiar faces have cropped up and a mysterious and menacing castle has arisen which could spell doom for all. \n\nThoughts- Diving into this book was very easy after thoroughly enjoying the first in the series. Time has passed and Croaker and crew are a little more weathered, older and frankly depressed. The Black Company seems adrift and are losing themselves. The way Cook describes this is very well done and you can feel the weight that has settled on many of the members of the company. Croaker continues to be a fantastic protagonist, capable but also flawed. A new POV character is also introduced Shed who is our eyes and ears over on the Western part of the world for most of the novel. This was an interesting decision which I can imagine might have upset some readers who had become accustomed to Croaker. I didn\u2019t have a real problem with Shed\u2019s story and even though he was fairly repugnant and deplorable he grew on me and Cook wrote him well enough that by the end you really felt for him. This book feels smaller scale than the last novel and even though it has large scale implications for the Black Company by the end it felt like a bit of a middle novel. There were a few moments where I wanted to move along to the next event in Croaker or Shed\u2019s story and felt a little bogged down in this or that. Once again though, despite these flaws I am still intrigued in where we are going and love the folks I am travelling with. A minor question for those who have read the entire saga, does each trilogy have a complete ending, or do they all meld together into one complete series? \n\nRating- 3.5/5 stars. Not as good as the first book in the series but still contains the great characters and world that Cook has developed. Suffers a bit from feeling like a middle book. \n\n**Tooth and Claw by Jo Walton**\n\nBasic Outline- Pride & Prejudice & Dragons? When their father dies a family is torn apart by grief, distance and dispute. Primarily over the distribution of his body and who got to eat the choicest pieces\u2026.\n\nThoughts- Ok the outline while slightly over the top but when I heard the premise for this book I really thought it would be more Austen type storytelling than dragon fights and cannibalism. It is, but there is a lot more of the dragon-ey stuff in here than I expected. Which ultimately was a good thing for me. The story is mostly split into three with each part following one of the siblings effected by the inheritance dispute. The son we follow is suing his brother in law for taking advantage of the family and follows his city living trying to make his own way in the world. It might be weakest of the three stories for me with his live in disgraced partner being a good character but with many rushed elements specifically towards the end of the book which I found underdeveloped. The next part (they are all interwoven chapter by chapter) follows one of the maiden sisters as she moves in with her priest brother after nearly being assaulted and married off to a scoundrel parson. Selendra is her name and her story was by far my favourite and the best developed. The intrigue about will she be able to be married successfully (no spoilers but there are many complications including her prior victimization) is the best in the book and has some of the best adventures and characters. The third part involve the other maiden sister Haner moving in with her sister and the brother in law who overstepped his bounds for inheritance. I enjoyed the villainy and the awful conditions of the brother in law in his domain and the casual bystander factor that Haner observes and tries to rail against but once again many parts seem rushed or underwritten particularly Haner\u2019s \u201ccause\u201d later on in the book. Overall, I enjoyed what Walton created with this novel but feel like it could have used a sequel or even a trilogy to fully explore the ideas and characters within. As is there is a lot of fun to be had imagining dragons in tricorn hats arguing in court about who should have gotten the biggest piece of their father\u2019s flesh to eat so they can grow larger.  \n\nRating-3.5/5 stars. A really unique mashup of Austen style storytelling mixed in with the casual bloodthirstiness of dragons. Too many conveniences and rushing the ending holds this book back from being great. \n\n**Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree**\n\nBasic Outline- Viv the orc has decided to hang up her sword and forge a new, less bloody path for herself. Her dream is to open her own coffee shop, but will her past allow her to?\n\nThoughts- This is my first foray into the \u201ccozy\u201d genre and I have to say as a palette cleanser from the usual wicked villains and epic battles of other fantasy novels this was a great change of pace. The stakes are fairly low but meaningful to the characters that Baldree introduces us to. That might be the best aspect of this pleasant story is the menagerie of characters populating Viv;s coffee shop. From a stoic hob carpenter, to a reserved succubus and probably my favourite an almost mute rattkin baker they all have their quirks and moments of importance to the building and operation of Viv\u2019s dream. There are many obstacles in the way of achieving this personal dream but everyone works together and supports each other in a way that is beyond wholesome. I wish there was a little more backstory to a few of the characters (we get a little more about Viv\u2019s in the attached prequel short story \u201c*Pages to Fill\u201d* included in my version), particularly Tandri who I was curious about many aspects of her former life. I also felt like there were moments that felt slightly rushed in particular when it comes to some of the romantic aspects of the book. It would be unkind to label something like this as fluff but it is definitely a nice easy going read that is not overly challenging and just delightful in the way the characters behave and interact with their world. \n\nRating-3.5/5 stars. This is close to a 4 star. Extremely pleasant and positive. I would be interested in reading another book in this world to change lanes from the usual swords and blackhearts that we become accustomed to. WARNING will make you want a cup of coffee and baked goods!\n\n**The White Rose by Glen Cook**\n\nBasic Outline- Book three of The Black Company. After the events of *Shadows Linger* the company is on the run and holed up in a disturbing and precarious position out in the magical Plains of Fear. Croaker begins receiving letters detailing the origins of the infamous mage Bomanz who resurrected the Lady centuries ago. Who is sending them and how they will they help decide the fate of the North?\n\nThoughts- Glen Cook continues to write such an enjoyable story with endearing characters that adds new layers each book to the lore and world building. The main lets say 7 characters that we have followed throughout this initial three books are so familiar now that you know them like old friends (or enemies). A minor complaint I have is that there are a few characters that Cook wants us to care about and they unfortunately are not as well realized even though they have been with us for three books (I am mainly talking about Elmo and The Lieutenant). Otherwise the ongoing shenanigans between One-Eye and Goblin are still here, the stoic badassery of Silent, the sarcastic romanticism of Croaker and maybe even a few returning character surprises. Without getting into spoilers there are some fabulous moments with Croaker and a certain someone. I immensely enjoyed the world building of the Plains of Fear which started out as being truly bizarre and unexplained but grew on me with their strange denizens especially the windwhales and the menhir (rock people). The relationships between everyone crescendo in this book and the final confrontation was appropriately epic. I am very interested in seeing where The Black Company goes from here since this does seem like the end of an era (despite a good little teaser into potential future evils). One other minor issue I had was, perhaps just my own but when it came to the origins of two new characters (Tracker and Toadkiller Dog) I seemed to have missed the initial explanation of where they came from and why there were there. It became clear in the third act but there is something about Cook\u2019s writing that sometimes I feel slightly lost about certain things. \n\nRating-4/5 stars. Close to a 4.5. The Black Company\u2019s first three books end on a high note. This is a great fantasy saga with complex and interesting characters which I can recommend to anyone who enjoys the darker side of the genre. \n\n**Best Served Cold by Joe Abercrombie**\n\nBasic Outline- The first standalone novel in The First Law universe sees a new setting, Styria. The constant struggle for power and domination has caused the recent times to be labelled The Years of Blood in the country and at the forefront is Monza Murcatto and her brother Benna. When Monza is left broken and betrayed she will mark many of the most prominent figures in the country for vengeance. Will she succeed? Who will she recruit in her quest for revenge? \n\nThoughts- I loved the original First Law trilogy and had heard from many that this standalone is the best of the bunch and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. It was a nice change of pace to be somewhere new and be introduced to a mostly new cast (with a few exceptions) since Abercrombie is one of the best character writers in the business. Some of my favourites included the return of the untrustworthy merc with a heart only for gold (or maybe not) Cosca and the deluded poisoner Morveer. Abercrombie is still the master of making despicable people somewhat likable or at least interesting. The way he weaves the tale of Murcatto you easily understand her motivations at least at the start of the novel and want her to take her revenge. One of my favourite tropes from any sort of media is the assembling of a crew where each character gets their little introduction and how the personalities clash or jive. It worked so well in this that when things start to fall apart for them later in the book I missed the dynamic of the group immensely. It went along at a great pace for me until about 5/7ths (if you have read the book you might get the choice here) and then it sort of hit a skid for a while which slowed down the great momentum. That hiccup aside the finale was great and the book ended in an unexpected but satisfying way (well for Abercrombie satisfying rarely equals happy but it was enough to continue holding up The First Law as some of the best fantasy books I have read in years). \n\nRating-4.5/5 stars. Another excellent entry into The First Law universe. Great characters, interesting arcs and with one pacing issue and amazing novel. Can\u2019t wait for the next adventure!\n\n**THANKS FOR READING!**\n\nIf you want to read my previous fantasy reviews I will post the link here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/15b05qn/summer\\_reading\\_reviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/15b05qn/summer_reading_reviews/)\n\nBooks reviewed include: The Time of Contempt, Fairy Tale, The Blade Itself, Before they are Hanged, The Last Argument of Kings and The Winter King. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/17v5x17/fall\\_fantasy\\_reviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/17v5x17/fall_fantasy_reviews/)\n\nBooks reviewed include: The Black Company, The Sword of Destiny, Enemy of God & Excalibur and The Blacktongue Thief. \n\n**Potential Options Upcoming books:**\n\nOwned- The Archer\u2019s Tale by Cornwell, Shadow Games, Dreams of Steel & The Silver Spike by Cook. \n\nWishlist- Shadow of the Gods by Gwynne, Assassin\u2019s Apprentice by Hobb and The Heroes by Abercrombie.

        "body": "I know this is a little late, but I finished the last book at around midnight right before the April 1 deadline, and then I needed to go to bed, and then needed a day to write all this up. So here it is, better posted late than never.\n\nI\u2019ve participated in Fantasy Bingo for a few years now, but for the first time this year I decided to do a themed card. I\u2019d seen some other people\u2019s themed cards and thought it looked fun. Some people\u2019s themes were downright impressive.\n\nAnd so I said to myself, I\u2019m going to do a card with nothing but translations.\n\nAnd then, when I started planning out my card and saw that the whole thing was dominated by two or three languages, I modified my theme: All translations, with one language per square. No repeats. If you use Spanish for one square, you can\u2019t use any more books translated from Spanish.\n\nIn hindsight, this might have been a mistake. Some languages have a lot of translated material to work with, and some languages have one obscure fantasy book that only special collection college libraries have in their catalog. I found myself not picking the translations I was most interested in, but based on how to best fill the more restrictive squares. There really aren\u2019t that many fantasy series that get translated, nor does there seem to be much of a market for translated superheroes, and Book Club had only read translations from three languages when bingo kicked off, though now I believe that number is up to 4. (Though it\u2019s entirely possible I missed a book at some point when scrolling through the goodreads list.) So while, for instance, Our Share of Night was the most interesting newly released translation last year (for me personally,) I needed to save Spanish for the Book Club square, because the only historical book club selections I was seeing that were also translations were translated from Spanish, Polish, and Russian, and I needed Polish for the Sequel square and would likely need Russian for the Bottom of the TBR square, since the only translations that had been on my TBR list for long enough to fit were from Russian, Spanish, and Japanese, and I needed Japanese for the Superhero square and the Spanish book was the same as the Spanish Book Club book\u2026\n\nYou can see how this quickly added a layer of difficulty beyond just finding 25 different languages that had a fantasy book already translated into English that also fit a square on the card.\n\nAnother layer of difficulty was my realization that publishers will call anything magical realism. Truly, if a book is translated from another language and there\u2019s an extended metaphor drawn from folklore, or if said folklore is treated as serious and real by the characters and forms a key part of how they interpret the world, then it will be labeled magical realism. Even if no creatures from folklore actually, unambiguously appear or do anything that can\u2019t be reasonably explained by the reader without folklore. I had so many squares that I had to come up with a back-up for because my initial selection turned out to not be speculative enough to count in my mind. I did end up keeping some books that were right on the line as a judgment call, but I discarded anything that did not have any speculative elements at all, or whose only speculative elements were that the book was set in a made-up country or that the characters sincerely believed in their folklore.\n\nStill, it was a good challenge, and pulling it off felt like a real achievement.\n\n**Title w/ a Title: The King of the Copper Mountains by Paul Biegel (Dutch)**\n\nSo this actually wasn\u2019t by first choice for this square. I was going to use \\*\\***A Letter to the King\\*\\*** instead, but unfortunately, despite being listed as a fantasy book when I was initially looking into it, it didn\u2019t really have much in the way of speculative elements. I thought I was good as gold when I saw the magic powers in the Netflix show based off that book, but it turns out Netflix added the magic powers, and no one in the books does any magic. So I ended up reading The King of the Copper Mountains as a last-minute back-up instead. It\u2019s cute enough, but definitely meant for a younger audience, which I knew going in.\n\n**Superheroes: Sailor Moon by Naoko Takeuchi (Japanese)**\n\nThis was a difficult square, but I think Sailor Moon is close enough to count as a super hero. This one had a little bit of a slow start - it takes a while to gather people up and introduce them, but I guess sometimes you just need to take your time. I think I would have enjoyed this more a few years ago, but it was still perfectly enjoyable now.\n\n**Bottom of the TBR: The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov (Russian)**\n\nI\u2019ve been meaning to read this one for a long time now, but never seemed to get around to it. It didn\u2019t end up being at all what I\u2019d expected- I\u2019d heard a lot of praise for its themes, for it\u2019s connection to the Soviet Era, but not about the humor. I listened to this one on audiobook, and the narrator did a pretty good job differentiating each character with a speaking role. Overall pretty enjoyable.\n\n**Magical Realism: Red Ants by Pergentino Jos\u00e9 (Sierra Zapotec)**\n\nSo technically I think this one might have been translated into English from the Spanish translation of the original Sierra Zapotec - my copy of the book wasn\u2019t super clear whether it was translated directly from the original version or not - but since it was originally written in Sierra Zapotec that\u2019s what I\u2019m counting it as. This was a collection of magical realism short stories, which on the whole were pretty enjoyable to read. They were very short - I don\u2019t think there was a single one longer than maybe six pages - so there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of time for complex development or characterization, but the writing was vivid and many scenes were haunting even when it wasn\u2019t really clear what was going on.\n\n**YA: Mountain of the Moon by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay (Bengali)**\n\nThis one is right on the cusp of not being speculative enough. However, right towards the end, there is an encounter with a creature that doesn\u2019t really exist, a sort of mythical creature, and I decided it was enough to count. This was a fun adventure-style book, though definitely written for a younger audience and requiring quite a suspension of disbelief. I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s humanly possible to cross the distances the characters claim to have crossed in the time they claim to have done it through the biomes they described - hey, perhaps that should be the speculative element.\n\nThis book is a \u2018kumar-sahitya\u2019 novel, a genre of Bengali literature that is a sort of a mix between adventure story, travelogue, and light fantasy-thriller aimed at a younger (but not too young) audience. I made the executive decision that this was close enough to YA, as the audience age range is about the same, as far as I can tell. Since this one was originally published in the 1930s, I expected it to feel more dated than it did; while some attitudes and ideas about Africa were certainly a bit dated, they were nowhere near as dated as they could be, and the text itself didn\u2019t show its age as clearly as I would have expected. Perhaps that is the result of translation choices, with the translator opting to go for a more timeless tone; I don\u2019t know enough about Bengali literature to compare.\n\n**Mundane Jobs: Man Tiger by Eka Kurniawan (Indonesian)**\n\nThis one is another maybe-magical realism one that I decided was magical-realism-enough to count. As far as I could tell, the white tiger that lives inside our protagonist is both metaphorical and physically real.\n\nThis book is one of those books that seems to be moving slowly and not doing a lot until all of a sudden it all snaps together. It opens with a certain sense of urgency- a young man has just committed a violent murder, and it is not entirely clear why. Then the novel seemingly decides to set that mystery aside and slowly introduce us to our main character\u2019s mother, father, sisters, extended family, girlfriend, girlfriend\u2019s family and extended family until you want to scream \u2018yes, these families are full of disappointments and problems but what are we even building towards here? Then, on the very last page, it all finally snaps together so perfectly that retroactively that long, slow middle feels genius and necessary.\n\n**Published in the 00s: The Man Who Spoke Snakish by Andrus Kivir\u00e4hk (Estonian)**\n\nThis is another one that I\u2019d heard about and had been intending to check out for a while now but never really got around to. I enjoyed this one; it did a good job developing ideas about tradition and modernity and forcing them out of their dichotomy with each other. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about the ending section, which I would describe as a crescendo of senseless though perhaps thematically-appropriate violence, but I definitely can\u2019t fault it on thematic grounds.\n\n**Angels and Demons: Forest of a Thousand Daemons: A Hunter\u2019s Saga by D.O. Fagunwa (Yoruba)**\n\nThis book wasn\u2019t my favorite, but I\u2019m hesitant to bad-mouth it too much. It was first published in the \u201830s, like Mountains of the Moon, and draws heavily on a sort of syncretism between Christianity and traditional West African thought and myth. As such, I feel like I\u2019m missing a lot of context while reading this one. However, I must say that sometimes our hero\u2019s adventures felt a bit pointless and all of the women characters were treated pretty terribly. On the other hand, it certainly wasn\u2019t boring, which is a point in its favor.\n\n**Short Stories: Creative Surgery by Clelia Farris (Italian)**\n\nThis was a fun, short little collection; the two stand-out stories were one about what a young man is willing to sacrifice to protect the ancient burial ground he lives on and the titular story, featuring appropriately horrifying surgery. No one in that last story is passing their ethics classes.\n\nI\u2019d originally picked out a different collection for this square, a collection of short stories translated from a variety of Filipino languages. Unfortunately, while that collection was recommended to me on a list of translated FANTASY books, less than half of the stories were speculative, and fewer than half of those were unambiguously speculative.\n\n**Horror: Let The Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist (Swedish)**\n\nGod this was a bleak book. Good, but bleak. I could feel the hard gray concrete-ness of the story\u2019s setting permeate every section that I read. Truly there was no beauty to be found in the setting- the only beauty in this entire book comes from the (somewhat rare) scenes where people trust another person and have that trust vindicated. And honestly, I feel like that worked really well for this story. I would definitely recommend it, though with the caveat that it\u2019s not the right choice if you\u2019re looking for a light, fun pick-me-up read.\n\n**Self-Published/Indie: When I Sing, Mountains Dance by Irene Sol\u00e0 (Catalan)**\n\nThis book book was just the right length for what it was. Each chapter focused on one character in or with a connection somehow to a family living in a small village in the Pyrenees, and is not-quite self-contained. Things are just connected enough to keep the book from being just interconnected short stories. One of the things I liked a lot about this book was the broad definition of \u2018person with connection to the family.\u2019 There were bits from the POV of the mountains, from the POV of a deer in the forest nearby, and a bit from the POV of the weather. The writing is gorgeous, which pairs well with the decidedly non-human narration of the non-human POV sections and makes the creative POV choices stand out even more. If you like fantasy and are looking for something with smaller stakes and less charging off to fight a dragon, I can recommend this book.\n\n**Set in the Middle East: The Emperor Tea Garden by Nazl\u0131 Eray (Turkish)**\n\nI don\u2019t entirely feel that I got this one, even though it was a fun read. For a while I thought the narrator was in fact two different people, and I\u2019m still not entirely convinced that they weren\u2019t. I didn\u2019t much care for any of the characters, which put a little bit of a damper on my enjoyment.\n\nThis was another one where the book I finally chose for the square was an emergency back-up because my planned choice didn\u2019t end up being speculative enough for me to feel that it counted.\n\n**Published in 2023: No Edges: Swahili Stories by Various Authors (Swahili)**\n\nThis collection was both more and less entertaining than I had expected, which is sort of par for the course with short story collections like this. Some stories were more fun than others. On average I\u2019d give it three stars.\n\n**Multiverse: The Neverending Story by Michael Ende (German)**\n\nI don\u2019t know how much of my enjoyment of this book was because it is a genuinely fun, entertaining read with plenty of adventure and interesting creatures and inventive settings and how much was because I read it on the heels of two mildly disappointing books and two extremely disappointing books, one of which was quite possibly the worst book I\u2019ve read in the past decade (and which, unfortunately, will be reviewed further down this post). I needed a win after that disappointing streak, and The Neverending Story delivered.\n\n**POC Author: The Wizard of the Crow by Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o (Gikuyu)**\n\nThis book was incredible. I\u2019d heard it praised often before, so I came in with high expectations, but it met those expectations beautifully, and now I\u2019m going around recommending it to my IRL book club and my coworkers and my mom. I\u2019ve never seen a book balance its tone between comedy and fear so perfectly for so long- not once over the nearly 800 pages did it swerve too far into one side or the other.\n\n**Book Club: Kalpa Imperial: The Greatest Empire that Never Was by Ang\u00e9lica Gorodischer (Spanish)**\n\nEver since I learned that Ursula K. Le Guin translated this book I\u2019ve been meaning to read it. I\u2019ve heard it praised often on this sub, and the title was intriguing. Thankfully, it met all of my expectations. Each story had both fun and inventive bits and real meat that you could chew on without getting bogged down. It\u2019s rare for what is essentially a collection of stories, albeit all linked by their shared setting, to be this consistently good from story to story.\n\n**Novella: The Employees by Olga Ravn (Danish)**\n\nThis was a weird one. The author\u2019s background is in poetry, and you can really see it in how abstract much of this book is. There might not even be a single named character. It\u2019s supposedly a sort of found-footage-type book in the form of interviews conducted by a company with their human and humanoid employees aboard a spaceship of some sort. However, we don\u2019t see the questions, only the responses, and while some people are clearly interviewed more than once and time clearly passes, each interview is labeled only with a number- no name, no context, nothing at all. The numbers appear to be chronological, proceeding from interview #1 to interview #2 to #20 to # 131 and so on, but it\u2019s impossible to tell if they\u2019re truly chronological or just roughly chronological, and some numbers are missing. However, despite all this, there are some really neat, hit-you-upside-the-head lines, and the author still managed to create a sense of rising tension.\n\n**Mythical Beasts: Fishing for the Little Pike by Juhani Karila (Finnish)**\n\nThis was a fun one. It switches back and forth between a woman who needs to catch a specific pike fish or she will die and the detective trying to track her down for her suspected role in a murder. All along the way are a variety of fabulous, creepy creatures and witchcraft.\n\nI\u2019d never read anything from the \u2018Finnish Weird\u2019 subgenre before, mostly because their summary blurbs never seem that interesting to me, but I might have to give some more of them a try after Fishing for the Little Pike.\n\n**Elemental Magic: Thunderbird by Sonia Nimr (Arabic)**\n\nThis book had so many problems, but I am reluctant to judge it too harshly because I suspect they are not really the fault of the book itself. At first, as I was reading, I asked myself what editor would ever agree to publish something so weirdly paced. Basic information about the premise and how the speculative elements functioned was still being revealed at the \u2154 point, our heroine accepted her magic time-travel quest with maybe three chapters and twenty pages left to go, thematic elements were introduced to early or too late, things that should have been short subplots went on for far too long relative to the length of the book- the list of structural weirdnesses went on and on.\n\nThen, I had an aha-moment. This book wasn\u2019t translated by a recognizable commercial publisher or an indie publisher that deals with international literature, but by a Center for Middle East Studies affiliated with some university, and it had a \u201csequel\u201d that had the exact same name with a \u2018book 2\u2019 appended to the end. I began to suspect that this had been translated not as a Middle Grade fantasy novel but as a piece of literature by a Palestinian author that discusses Israel-Palestine relations, and that the pervasive structural issues and abrupt ending that didn\u2019t resolve anything were because the grant money to pay the translator ran out before the book did, hence it being split up into multiple pieces in the translation process. I can\u2019t rag on a book for having terrible, nonsensical structure and no real resolution if those issues are only issues because I\u2019m only reading the first third or so of the book.\n\nOn a side note, it was nice to see a Middle Grade book where the main character goes to their parents/parental figures and tells them about the frightening and unprovable supernatural things that are happening to them and have said parental figures believe them immediately and start taking practical steps to help them.\n\n**Myths and Retellings: Baba Yaga Laid an Egg by Dubravka Ugre\u0161i\u0107 (Croatian)**\n\nGod I hated this book. I hated this book so much that when I was thinking back over my year of reading back in December, I initially thought this had been a bad year for me, with too many disappointing and uninspiring books. Then I realized that actually, this one book was just bringing down my entire perception of the year; I kept getting bored or frustrated and putting it down \u2018just for a moment,\u2019 and then before I knew it it was due back at the library, and then I\u2019d have to check it out again and restart from where I\u2019d left off, which meant that I ended up reading it over the course of several months, a little bit at a time. Because it was so spread out, it felt in retrospect like I\u2019d had several months of unenjoyable reads.  \nFor a while I wasn\u2019t even sure if this was speculative enough to count- there\u2019s only a moment or two of blink-and-you-miss-it magic. However, it must have been speculative enough for the Otherwise Award judges, because it won in 2010. (How??? How did this garbage win any kind of award??? Was 2010 just a really bad year for books related to gender and/or sexuality in speculative fiction? Did it run unopposed???) Also, I felt true despair at the idea of slogging through the whole book only to not count it, so I elected to count it.\n\n**Queernorm: Little Mushroom: Revelations by Shisi (Chinese)**\n\nThis is technically part two of a single book, which was split into two books when it was translated into English. I wish it hadn\u2019t been split, since I think some of the character and relationship development in this book would have hit harder and made more sense if there wasn\u2019t a big gap dividing the first half from the second half like that. However, I did still enjoy myself.\n\nSome ideas from this one reminded me of ideas from the first Three Body Problem book, which now leaves me curious whether these ideas are just more common in Chinese sci-fi or if this book actively took inspiration from the Three Body Problem. Or maybe the Three Body Problem was just such a big hit that some of its ideas have become pervasive in Chinese sci-fi publishing. I guess I\u2019ll just have to read more Chinese sci-fi to find out.\n\n**Coastal/Island: Hadriana in All My Dreams by Ren\u00e9 Depestre (French)**\n\nOne of the most interesting things about this book was how different its zombies were from the zombies I\u2019m used to. These ones were much more rooted in voodoo and the history of slavery than the zombies I come across in other fantasy books. In fact, these zombies aren\u2019t even that much of a danger to other people; the primary danger is to the zombified person\u2019s own spiritual well-being. It ended up not becoming a new favorite, but reading it was still a valuable exercise.\n\n**SUBSTITUTION- Non-Human Character: Walking Practice by Dolki Min (Korean)**\n\nI was initially turned off from this book by the description- I wasn\u2019t really interested in watching an alien hunt and eat people. However, I saw it getting some praise on this sub, and as the Bingo deadline loomed I needed something short. I\u2019m glad I ended up reading this one- it was a lot more entertaining than I had expected.\n\n**Robots: R. U. R. by Karel \u010capek (Czech)**\n\nThis work was the first to use the word \u2018robot\u2019, and could debatably be called the first ever robot story (though of course, stories of artificial, debatably-alive creatures predate it.) That is part of why I picked it- I was curious about the first robot story.\n\nI can see how this would have been incredibly compelling to see live on stage when it was first written; however, since then other authors have done much more interesting and thought-provoking things with the subject, so this felt unfairly boring. I suspect it would have been better as it was meant to be experienced- as a stage play- but I\u2019m not sure that would have been enough to make up for the simple fact that robots are not a new idea that can carry a story by itself anymore.\n\n**Sequel: The Time of Contempt by Andrzej Sapkowski (Polish)**\n\nThis one was much like the first book in the series. I think I enjoy the style and pacing of this series, where only the important scenes necessary to move the plot along are included- there\u2019s not much in the way of connective tissue scenes or and-now-it\u2019s-going-to-take-fifty-pages-to-get-to-the-city sections; anything that can be skipped over is skipped over. This makes things a little more disjointed, and definitely makes it harder to keep track of how much time has passed, but in return it makes each scene feel high-impact and important, as well as nearly self-contained.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ir4rf1n4m3sc1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fa33b6bfc669d77bcc4519609a2f5d50b307fef\n\n"

It is the strongest, stand-alone novel in the series.\n\nIf you want to read the entire series, here is my suggested reading order.\n\n* [Terciel and Elinor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56382390-terciel-and-elinor)\n* [Sabriel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/518848.Sabriel)\n* [Lirael](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47624.Lirael?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=6NvlEpWqv2&rank=1)\n* [Abhorsen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334643.Abhorsen)\n* [The Creature in the Case](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1042546.The_Creature_in_the_Case) (Novella)\n* [To Hold the Bridge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23213811-to-hold-the-bridge) (Novella)\n* [Goldenhand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29414640-goldenhand)\n* [Clariel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20662728-clariel)\n\nThis is *mostly* internal chronological order. 'Terciel and Elinor' serves as a strong prequel to set up the rest of the series. I think the series as a whole would be improved if a reader reads it first.\n\n\n\nBefore we begin, do you have a book which needs editing? Do you want to read more reviews? Here is a link: [The Rest of My In Depth Reviews](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2021/05/13/my-in-depth-reviews-analysis/)\n\nIn 1997, Harry Potter exploded like a nuke across popular culture. In 2008, The Hunger Games took it's turn to change the YA scifi/fantasy genre. These books are still massively influential on both Middle Grade, YA and Adult scifi and fantasy.\n\n'Sabriel,' the first book in The Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix was published in 1995. This is a YA series which feels like a 'what could have been?' if the genre evolved without the one-two punch of Harry Potter and Hunger Games. The Old Kingdom, in some ways, feels like a throwback to the genre as it was before. It's unapologetically classical, with a strong Athurian undercurrent in early books and a repeating Chosen One narrative.\n\nThis series never tried to play it safe and be 'modernized.' Today, a LOT of YA and Fantasy books are about an underdog combating a government and trying to change it. The Old Kingdom is different. Instead of starring rebels opposing entrenched power structures, the heroes in this seek to repair and defend the entrenched power structures. This series is a modern coelacanth, a black sheep among whites.\n\nGrowing up, I read the books of 'The Old Kingdom' by Garth Nix a lot. Specifically, the first trilogy. They were a comfort read for me in a hard time in my life. Now an adult, I decided to read the entire series (novellas and newly added books included) to get a fresh perspective on a series which were highly influential on me.\n\nLet's establish a baseline. The book 'Sabriel' was the first book in the series, and was published in 1995. Book 2, 'Lirael,' was published in 2001. Book 3, 'Abhorsen,' was published in 2003. 'Lirael' and 'Abhorsen' were originally written as a single book, but were split up for publication separately because together they'd be a really long book. 'The Creature in the Case' is a novella written in the same setting, starring Nicolas Sayre as the protagonist, and was published in 2005. Book 4, 'Clariel' was published in 2014. The anthology 'To Hold the Bridge' was published in 2015. Book 5, 'Goldenhand' was published in 2016. And finally, the most recent book 'Terciel and Elinor' was published in 2021.\n\nThis series is about the Abhorsen family. The Abhorsens are a hereditary line of monster hunters, empowered by ancient magical spirits to use both good and evil sorcery for the cause of good. They are necromancers who lay the dead to rest.\n\nPersonally, I am a fan of the original trilogy and less of a fan of the following books.\u2002I think this is a common sentiment among fans of this series. I'm not sure how much of this is sentiment putting blinkers on, and how much of it is the following books being less thrilling. I will say this: the climax of 'Abhorsen' feels like a definitive 'stopping point' for the series, so maybe a lot of people just fell away after that.\n\n[Sabriel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/518848.Sabriel)\n\nI feel like this is the best book in the series on a purely technical skill level. It's tightly plotted and paced, with nothing extraneous added in. The prose is lovely, almost purple, contrasting a grim setting. It provides just enough detail to the setting to leave the reader wanting more information about the Charter, the undead, the monsters, the history of the Old Kingdom. Overall, this is a great way to start a series.\n\nIf I'll ding points, it's in characterization. Sabriel and Touchstone are very reserved characters. It's true they have personalities, but they're subdued. Sabriel feels like a prim-and-proper school prefect, who feels the weight of responsibility and bears it with a stiff upper lip like a trad British aristocrat. Touchstone is SUUUPER depressed as a result of his backstory; naturally he won't be bombastic. As a result of both not being bombastic, both are bland.\n\nThis doesn't mean they're bad characters. However, if you're used to more angsty modern YA protagonists like Rin from Poppy War or Katniss from Hunger Games, you're gonna think they're boring AF. However, if you're in the mood for a more emotionally mature set of protagonists, Sabriel and Touchstone are really good. They are YA characters who actually feel like normal people who you'd meet in real life, as opposed to larger-than-life personalities.\n\nThe exception to this rule about characterization is Mogget (and later the Disreputable Dog). Where Sabriel and Touchstone are reserved, Mogget is a snarky asshole demon who's tame (for now). He never skips an opportunity to sass the main characters, and he's a hoot to have around. Tim Curry was a fantastic narrator, bringing Mogget to life.\n\nI have a lot more to say, but I've already discussed '[Sabriel'](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2023/11/11/review-for-sabriel-by-garth-nix/) here and [here](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/11/05/sabriel-by-garth-nix/).\n\n[Lirael ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47624.Lirael?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=6NvlEpWqv2&rank=1)and [Abhorsen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334643.Abhorsen)\n\nI personally love the first half of 'Lirael'. It starts with Lirael as a depressed teenaged librarian in a library which functions as a museum for ancient secrets, a prison for demons, and a repository for ancient prophesies, carved into the ice of a vast glacier. It's such a great setting. Lirael's adventures in the library are so fantastic, I wish we got an entire book in this setting.\n\nThe second half of 'Lirael' serves as the beginning half of the Orannis duology. Now an adult, Lirael must go on an adventure to save the kingdom from a '[Sealed Evil in a Can](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan).' Orannis is an evil spirit from the beginning of time who's sole goal is destroying literally everything in flame. He's not a generic Big Bad; generic Big Bads usually involve some fascist thematic overtones, a la Sauron or Emperor Palpatine. Orannis is even more basic; he's a talking MacGuffin. I'll be honest, I think Orannis is a boring villain.\n\nHedge, on the other hand, is an interesting villain. A former Ancelstierran soldier who got lost in the monstrous north, and picked up sorcery and necromancy to survive. He gained immortality by serving Kerrigor in book 1, and now that Kerrigor is gone he's working for Orannis. Where Orannis is basically a boring MacGuffin, Hedge inspires fear in the hearts of all the characters. I liked him as a villain; he felt undefeatable. I wish he didn't go out like a chump at the end, but we can't always have nice things.\n\nChlorr was a fun villain. She was out of focus enough to be spooky, and scary enough to make even Hedge think twice about crossing her. Sometimes with villains, less is more; Chlorr sat perfectly in that 'less is more' area. The reveal at the end that she used to be an Abhorsen set up the latter half of this series. (And in the audiobook, Tim Curry does a fantastic job of making her intimidating.)\n\nNicholas was an odd protagonist. He doubles as an antagonist. I felt like the author did a good job of making him simultaneously easy to empathize with, and also making him threatening. I'm glad he appears in later books, he was fun. I like how he's a scientist who's suddenly struggling to rationalize the fact that he's gained magic even though he spent the first half of his life disbelieving in magic.\n\nLirael herself struggles with depression. She grew up an ugly duckling amongst beautiful ducklings, and always felt out of place. She's goth, in a glacier filled with normies. It was VERY easy to empathize with her. She's my favorite protagonist in this series. Sam struggles with imposter syndrome; he doesn't feel like he can live up to his mother's legacy as Abhorsen. He just wants to fiddle with devices and make magical artifacts, not slay the dead. This doubles down on the same theme as Lirael; people are happiest when they strive to be *who they are* and not who society expects them to be. Lirael cannot be Clayr, while Sam cannot be Abhorsen.\n\nAnd finally, the Disreputable Dog. I think we all need a Disreputable Dog in our lives. Fun loving, a bit sassy, friendly, and wants what's best for you. Will trade belly rubs for sage advice. She's even willing to break the rules to help you. But Dog is not perfect; she can't get over her past prejudices even when it's long since time to forgive and give someone a second chance. Oddly, the dog sidekick in this series was the team's leader/Gandalf figure.\n\nThis series is the character arc for one very angry cat. Mogget is the only character who appears in every book, so I think this series is technically his series. Mogget starts as a genocidal demon intent on wiping out the human race. He ends the series a sociopathic trickster demigod who now willingly protects the Old Kingdom in exchange for fish. Typical cat behavior. But also, that's good character growth.\n\nNow let's talk about one aspect of this series I do NOT like. Magical bloodlines.\n\nThis duology really doubled down on the idea of magical bloodlines. The title of Abhorsen is passed down through the blood. The Royal line through the blood. The Clayr through the blood. No one else can defeat Orannis; it has to be these people whose ancestors were the correct people. Lirael becomes happy when she finds her biological family (Sabriel and the Abhorsen). Sam becomes happy when he discovers his ancestors (the Wallmakers, another magical bloodline). Kerrigor was scary because of his magical bloodline; Touchstone rebuilt the kingdom because of his magical bloodline. The Old Kingdom is helpless and can't fix it's own problems; it needs a Chosen One to come along and have it's problems fixed for it.\n\nAs a general rule, I don't like when authors use the magical bloodline trope because it tacitly legitimates an aristocracy/monarchy. There's no room for normal people in this system. There is no meritocracy; the Charter is strongest with these bloodlines. This series doesn't really develop any non bloodline characters until books 4 & 5, and even then the magical bloodline characters are still the protagonists.\n\n[The Creature in the Case](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1042546.The_Creature_in_the_Case)\n\nThis is a novella (\\~100pages) taking place shortly after the events of 'Abhorsen.' Nicholas Sayre returns to Ancelstierre to recover from being demon haunted. He's invited to the dinner party of a deluded Aliester Crowley type- a man obsessed with the mysterious and mystical. One thing leads to another, and Sayre's involved in *yet another* demonic uprising.\n\nI enjoyed this. It was short, sweet and to the point. The final reuniting between Nick and Lirael was understated, but I enjoyed it.\n\nWhen I think of the Old Kingdom series, Ancelstierre is an important aspect of what makes the setting so vibrant. If you've not read the series, allow me to explain: on the southern border of the Old Kingdom is the Wall, and on the far side of the Wall is another universe. To the north of the Wall, we have a standard Medieval Fantasy kingdom which is in the middle of an undead apocalypse, while to the south we have what is an alternate 1920's Britain with primitive cars and airplanes, the rising threat of fascism and prudish culture. The contrast between the medieval undead apocalypse of the Old Kingdom with the banal normalcy of the WW1 era England in Ancelstierre really is something fascinating to read.\n\nThis coziness/darkness balance is particularly dramatic in 'Sabriel,' when the evils of Kerrigor are brought home to Wyverly College, and ordinary school girls are forced the pay the price of his defeat. Here in 'Creature in the Case,' the context changes: scientists from the south are trying to use modern science to figure out magic. The scientists are doomed by their hubris.\n\nBut the Ancelstierrans aren't universally good. Ancelstierre is based on the British Empire at it's most powerful and corrupt. It's made clear that Ancelstierre politics is riven with double dealing, dirty money and political assassinations. The antagonists are more than willing to stoke the flames of nationalism when there's an influx of refugees from a distant war.\n\nThe various military characters in this series are shackled to corrupt and stick-in-the-mud superior officers, so that when the heroic soldiers are forced into suicidal missions it feels reminiscent of the way the British valorize their defeats, a la the 'The Charge of the Light Brigade.' The whole setting has a 'right hand knows not what the left hand does' sort of vibe, and that makes it feel authentic.\n\nAncelstierre uses WW1 military technology (such as trenches and endless masses of barbed wire) in a fruitless attempt to keep the Old Kingdom at arm's length. I like the whole 'out of sight, out of mind' attitude that Ancelstierre uses with Old Kingdom, resulting in a sort of provincial contempt for their northern neighbors.\n\nPart of the reason why I didn't like 'Clariel' as a book is because of the lack of that contrast between tea-and-crumpets and undead apocalypse. Speaking of which...\n\n[Clariel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20662728-clariel)\n\nI feel like this book is a bit of an ugly duckling in this series. Based on my skimming through internet message boards on this series, many people feel like 'Clariel' is when the series started going down hill. I understand why they think that.\n\nBefore I begin, I'll start with saying there are aspects of this book I enjoyed. I liked the dynamic between Clariel and her mom; they felt like a believably dysfunctional family. I liked the concept behind the political scenario. I liked how the author used the mechanism of 'Clariel is oppressed and trapped by her parents' as a metaphor to explain why she's sympathetic with Free Magic creatures who are oppressed and trapped by Charter Magic. And I enjoy that the protagonist is explicitly asexual.\n\nThe author has chops; no single chapter felt sloppy; everything was touched by a master of the craft.\n\nI personally like the idea behind this story. What happens when an Abhorsen becomes evil? This is the origin story for Chlorr, a fallen Abhorsen. That's an innately cool idea.\n\nUnfortunately, this book had the deck stacked against it from the beginning. I listened to the audiobooks of this series, in no small part because they got Tim Curry to be the narrator for the first three books in the series. 'Clariel' was the first book to not have Curry. Graeme Malcolm did a fine job as narrator, however he's no Tim Curry.\n\nI need to defend this book in one aspect; many reviews I read complain that the protagonist is unlikeable. Clariel is so stubborn, she has to be dragged kicking and screaming into every twist of the plot. It's easy to understand why some people don't like her as a protagonist, she is stubborn to the point of being passive. HOWEVER, unlikeable protagonists can still be good protagonists.\n\nNow THAT SAID, I struggled with Clariel as a protagonist. She really seemed to have a one-track mind, focused so much on returning to Estwael for so much of the book that other aspects of her characterization suffered. I'm fine with an unsympathetic character; I dislike flat characters.\n\nThis book was conceptualized as being the origin story for Chlorr of the Mask, one of the setting's main villains. I feel like there were two potential strategies for writing this story: either lean into the corruption arc, or tell a heroic story without any corruption.\n\n* If you tell a corruption arc, it would be the origin story for Chlorr of the Mask. I'm imaging something like 'The Poppy War' trilogy, where the reader follows a 'from nobody to nightmare' story of a character growing up from a young age as a relatively innocent child, to a demon in human flesh.\n* If you go the heroic story route, you'll get to lean into the pathos of showing how tragic of a figure Clariel/Chlorr actually is; if someone so good can become evil, it makes her fall that much more sad.\n\nTo me, it felt like the author tried to do both a corruption story and a heroic story at the same time, and it didn't work. Clariel never does anything heroic; she never saves a cat, as an example. Likewise, she never does anything truly reprehensible or corrupt. The book just... kinda fell flat in the end. So, neither a corruption arc or a heroic story; the book felt underbaked.\n\nThe biggest problem with 'Clariel' is that 'Clariel' as a reading experience feels age appropriate for Middle Grade readers (8 to 12 years old). Whereas I would say that 'Sabriel' or 'Lirael/Abhorsen' are appropriate for YA readers (13 to 20 years old). Once upon a time, people complemented the 'Harry Potter' series for growing more mature with every new volume added; the 'Harry Potter' series was growing up from Middle Grade to YA even as it's readers were growing up. The Old Kingdom aged *down* even as it's readers grew up.\n\nThis book is innately a political story: 600 years before the events of the initial trilogy. The king has gone mad, the Clayr hide in their glacier and the Abhorsen wastes his time hunting foxes. Given that vacuum of power, the guilds have taken over the running of the Kingdom, repressing the common people. The common people are constantly rebelling against the bourgeoise, with hints of a 'French Revolution' style revolt on the horizon. Now the bourgeoise goldsmith guild leader is planning on performing a (mostly) bloodless coup and taking control of the entire nation. Meanwhile, various eldritch horrors are stirring in the dark places, trying to use the chaos of the King's madness and the Abhorsen being useless to gain power.\n\nThis idea is sweet! The author is cooking with gas!\n\nThe problem is that I don't think Nix is a very good author when it comes to political plots, and I say this as a fan who's read 12+ of his books.\n\nThis is a deeply political storyline, but the author picked just about the worst way to tell it. Virtually every other political fantasy novel I've read is multi-POV. ASoIaF is multiPOV, as an example. 'Clariel,' on the other hand, is single POV. The advantage of using multi-POV in a political novel is that it lets you explore multiple sides of a political tangle. The choice to make 'Clariel' single POV made the plot feel simplistic.\n\nAnd then the whole political plotline is botched in the end, because Mogget becomes the final villain. Don't get me wrong, I like that Mogget had the chance to be evil. However, all the buildup in early tension in the 'evil bourgeois' plotline wound up deflating like a balloon because in the second half of the book all focus was put behind Mogget and the other Free Magic creatures. If you insist on having the final villain be Mogget, why not introduce Mogget early in the book, and show him be the mastermind behind the bourgeois all along? In retrospect, the first half of the book (Clariel going to finishing school) feels pointless.\n\nAnother big problem was that Clariel's motivations felt hollow. Clariel had two motivations: 'return to Estwael' and also 'save Aunt Lemon.' We're TOLD, not SHOWN that she had a happy childhood in Estwael. We're TOLD not SHOWN that Aunt Lemon is cool and needs to be saved. The reader is never shown Estwael, and the reader never is shown Aunt Lemon. As a general rule, SHOW>TELL is preferable to TELL>SHOW.\n\nOn this re-read, I tried to enjoy this book, but it misfired on pretty much every level. But my word isn't law. I know I nitpicked a lot here, feel free to disagree with me.\n\n[To Hold the Bridge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23213811-to-hold-the-bridge)\n\nThis is a short story/novella set in a small town north of the Clayr's Glacier. It's about a young man coming of age and independence after his abusive parents die, gaining confidence in himself. He gets a job working as a border guard on a bridge between the Old Kingdom proper, and the northern barbarian steppe.\n\nI really like the protagonist. He's just a normal dude. Compared to Sabriel and Lirael and Sammeth, he's a bad swordsmen and not a powerful Charter Mage. He's just barely getting by in life. Compared to the monsters and ghouls who populate the Old Kingdom, he's desperately outmatched. When Sabriel sees some Dead Hands, she can defeat them no problem; when this protagonist sees a Dead Hand, he's intimidated. This story accomplishes something which nothing else in this series accomplishes: it brings the horror to life.\n\nI enjoyed this book. It wasn't about the magical bloodlines of the Old Kingdom, and it showed that everyday life in the Old Kingdom can be both wonderful and terrible. As a piece of bite-sized fiction in this setting, I believe it's worth reading.\n\n[Goldenhand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29414640-goldenhand)\n\nThis is written as a followup to 'The Creature in the Case,' following Lirael's perspective for those same events, as well as events following them. As the first book written since 'Clariel,' I found this to mostly be a return-to-form for the series. I enjoyed this book, and find it a worthy inclusion in this series.\n\nI like Ferin as a protagonist; I liked the audiobook narrator, because the narrator did a good job giving Ferin a gruff harshness. Sabriel, Lirael, Sam, Nick and Clariel all are a bit milquetoast in comparison to Ferin; I liked how you can tell Ferin comes from an altogether harsher culture, because Ferin's view on life is brusque and to the point. She's called 'Ferin,' because that's short for 'Offering;' Ferin was raised to be a human sacrifice to appease Chlorr. Naturally, she has a warped view on life as a result of her childhood.\n\nWe don't get much of Ferin because she was only a secondary protagonist, but I think if we got more from her she might become my favorite protagonist in this series. She's smart and driven; after she suffers setbacks (such as losing a limb), she compartmentalizes the pain and focuses on the task at hand. After she gains her freedom from Chlorr, she realizes she wants to be a Charter mage. She goes out of her way and becomes a mage, even though other people don't think she can. I like how Ferin is willing to transgress social boundaries for the sake of getting shit done.\n\nFor the first 3/4 of the book, we have two groups of characters in separate locations running around doing adventures, trying to survive while they are being chased by villains and monsters... a very traditional Old Kingdom plotline. And that's good!\n\nWhat's not-so-good is the payoff. I feel like the book was just beginning to get started when \\*bang\\* Chlorr/Clariel was dead. I was left reeling with how fast we went from 'Act 1' to 'Act 3.' I feel as though this book lacks an Act 2. I needed another 50 pages or so.\n\nI like the new setting and the new antagonists; having viking/raider enemies who use Free Magic and necromancy was a neat twist on earlier books.\n\nEarlier books in the series had a bit purple prose... and I liked the purple. The prose was a bit colorful and stylish, almost ostentatiously so at times. With 'Clariel' and 'Goldenhand,' there isn't as much of that flair for the dramatic prose. But this is a personal taste thing; I as a reader have a high tolerance for purple prose, other people don't.\n\nI enjoyed Lirael's character arc in this book. After the victory against Orannis in the last book, she suffered emotional as well as physical defeats. She lost her hand in that battle (hence the title of 'Goldenhand;' Lirael got herself a prosthetic). She also lost her best friend, the Dog, in the last battle. She's on the emotional back foot in this book, constantly struggling with feelings of being worthy of the Abhorsen legacy (aka imposter syndrome). She defeated Orannis, but other Clayr still disrespectfully see her as the quiet library girl.\n\nLirael wants to defeat Chlorr herself, to prove to everyone (and herself) she can stand on her own without Sabriel or the Disreputable Dog. In 'Goldenhand,' Lirael is learning to stand up for herself, a skill she never had to gain in earlier books because she had the Dog to be assertive for her. I feel like that's good writing; Nix was able to find more character growth for a character who's already gone through her Hero's Journey, which is no mean feat.\n\nI did have a few problems with the end of the book.\n\nThe main antagonist (Chlorr of the Mask) was obscured for most of the novel. Chlorr only appears to say one or two lines of dialogue at the very end of the book. We got a LOT more of Chlorr in 'Lirael' and 'Abhorsen' and 'Clariel.' I think it's a bit weird that the novel where Chlorr is the main villain is also the novel where we get the least of her. Above I said that 'less is more' sometimes; in this case, 'more is more.'\n\nAt the very end of this book, Mogget and the Disreputable Dog returned.\n\n* I liked the return of Mogget; he played a mission critical job to save the day at the very end in a way which was thematically interesting. Ferin is from the Mountain Lion clan of northern nomads, so she views Mogget as sacred because he's a talking cat. I wish the author had Mogget be her companion from the beginning of the story. There was *something* *special* here, which sadly went unrealized because we got too little of Mogget.\n* I did NOT like the return of the Dog, even though the Dog is my favorite character in this series. Dog died at the end of 'Abhorsen;' her return here feels like it cheapened her death back then. Her return felt mainly like a Marvel Movie-esque cameo. It was distracting.\n\nI liked the idea behind the final battle, where two armies fight against one another. This series hasn't had a human army versus human army battle yet, so this is a genuinely clever and new thing. But I feel like this Military Fantasy element didn't pay off. I can't really in good faith blame the book on this, but myself; I enjoy Military Fantasy, and the author wasn't really trying to make this Military Fantasy. I had unrealistic expectations.\n\nAnd finally, the romance between Lirael and Nick. It was rushed. However, I liked it. It felt like a healthy relationship of two *extremely awkward* teenagers figuring out their emotions, how to express them, and sometimes failing. It was still rushed to the point of absurdity, but giving it the benefit of the doubt there is narrative meat on the bones of their relationship. They had actual chemistry.\n\nOverall, a worthy addition to the series. I'd happily read it again, even if this isn't very memorable.\n\n[Terciel and Elinor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56382390-terciel-and-elinor)\n\nA complete return to form for the series! I think it was as well written as 'Lirael' and 'Abhorsen,' but not as much as 'Sabriel.' This was the first time I've read this book. Spoilers.\n\nI enjoyed the fact that so much of this book took place in a Victorian-era Ancelstierre. Elinor is a member of the country gentry, who was sheltered by her family. After her family was impoverished, her mother was forced to make dark deals with Hedge to keep her family out of the poorhouse. With her mother's death, a Greater Dead takes possession of her body and goes on a rampage. Sheltered Elinor didn't believe that magic exists, so to see her mother become an undead abomination was great storytelling.\n\nThis book is about Sabriel's parents, Terciel and Elinor. Taking place over 20 years before the beginning of 'Sabriel,' the author relied on nostalgia to make this book work. It had many recurring characters and locations from earlier in the series such as Mogget and Filris and the Clayr's Glacier and Wyverly College. Kerrigor is the off-screen Big Bad in this book, while the main on-screen villain is a younger Hedge who serves Kerrigor.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this nostalgia.\n\n* On one hand, this book feels like a 'the best of The Old Kingdom series all return;' the author brings back many characters and locations which I am fond of, using them to enhance the depth of this story while also retroactively adding depth to earlier stories.\n* On the other hand, so many recurring characters makes me think 'Why do the same people keep showing up in every book? Are there only like five people in this Kingdom?'\n   * (You know how some people complain how the same characters keep re-appearing in the Star Wars stories, even though the Star Wars galaxy by all rights should have several trillion people? I'm starting to feel like that.)\n\nOverall, I think this book used that nostalgia well. There's a risk for books which rely heavily on nostalgia that they'll retroactively ruin earlier books, but that DID NOT happen here, which is good. But I think future books (if we are so lucky) need a clean break with new characters.\n\nOne thing I didn't like was how the Clayr used prophesy in this book. Basically, the Clayr foreshadowed the events of 'Sabriel' and 'Lirael.' It felt unnecessary, and bogged the story too much in nostalgia.\n\nElinor as a protagonist is charming. She's a warm hearted, yet out-of-her-depth young woman who's thrust out of her home when her home burns down. She uses her acrobatics and theater skills to secure a place for herself at Wyverly College, as the theater instructor. She's a delightfully earnest character, who manages to not be crushed by the memory of her mother's possession, and the death of all her friends when her possessed mother killed them. While I can't say she's an all-time favorite character, I'd be happy to read more books starring her.\n\nI didn't like the romance between Terciel and Elinor; it felt perfunctory. A lot of reviews for this book pointed out 'hey wait, this book was marketed as a romance but it's not actually a romance!' And I'm totally fine with that, I don't like romances. But still, this romance was a bit insta-love.\n\nTerciel exists, in the same way that vanilla pudding exists. I enjoy vanilla pudding, but I'll probably not order it if it's on the menu. I feel like I'm being unfair to him; the author deliberately writes 'normal people' to be protagonists, and Terciel feels normal. If I'm willing to read between the lines a little, I can pretend that he's so bland because he's emotionally stunted after a lifetime of being bullied and intimidated by his aunt, the Abhorsen Tizanael.\n\nAnd since I mentioned her, let's talk about Tizzy. You know Sanderson fans say 'Fuck Moash?' I'd like to say, 'FUCK Tizanael.'\n\nAlmost every time she's on the page, she's awful. When she first appears in the book, it comes with the reveal that a) she got Terciel's older sister killed and b) she allowed her nephew Terciel to labor in a poorhouse for the first decade of his life even though she could have easily plucked him out at any time. Tizanael is stubborn, hidebound, demeaning, tight-lipped and angry, holds a grudge for decades, and can be passive aggressive to boot.\n\nAnd yet Tizanael isn't evil. Using the D&D alignment system, she's Lawful Good. She's firmly on the side of good, but she's also a dick. She's had multiple Abhorsens-in-Waiting, and I speculate that she got all of them killed by using them as bait to destroy Kerrigor and other Dead.\n\nI loved Tizanael. Nix did an excellent job writing her, walking the line between making me feel 'I hate you' and 'I see where you're coming from and you're probably right.' She's in her seventies or eighties, but she's somehow managed to keep the threat of Kerrigor and the Greater Dead contained for her entire life. It makes sense that an Abhorsen who's survived 70 years of Kerrigor's Interregnum would be a piece of work. It's clear that Kerrigor has made MANY attempts to assassinate her over the decades, but she's too stubborn to die.\n\nI was a bit mid about this book's pacing. It felt a bit listless at parts. I was never bored, but there were moments when the story felt directionless. I felt like there were some scenes which could have been trimmed down or deleted. Elinor in Wyverly might be my favorite part of the book, but I think the Wyverly section needed something more. They seemed to spend too much time in Abhorsen's House too.\n\nAs for plot, I think this needed more plot. When I review books, I usually say 'the author should have trimmed out 20 to 50 pages.' I generally dislike the bloated nature of fantasy genre wordcounts. I don't say this very often, but I think this book could have *added* another 50 pages of plot. It needed more action, more intrigue, more characterization. Everything felt rushed.\n\nAnd finally, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. SPOILSERS!\n\nThe book contains a LOT of returning characters. Terciel, Hedge, Kerrigor, and even Elinor(briefly) all appear in later books. As a result, I was never afraid any of them would actually die. Put together, going into this book I knew the stakes we were playing with were reduced because of the old '[protected by canon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedByCanon)' trope.\n\nI think this book could have introduced a new antagonist and had them get killed, so the ending felt more juicy. I liked Tizzy so much in this book in part because she died, making the ending of this book feel more weighty. I wish a bad guy died along with her.\n\nTaking a step back, let's discuss some more technical problems.\n\nI wanted more try-fail cycles. A try-fail cycle is a recurring storybeat when the heroes attempt something, fail, and try again. It is used to show gradual character growth over time, and is generally fun to read. The heroes only fought Kerrigor once, and they beat him the first time; I think the book would have been improved if they fought him twice and failed the first time. But this is more personal taste thing.\n\nThis book had significant exposition. At around the midpoint, a bunch of characters convened on Abhorsen's House and there was a lot of dialogue. It slowed the pace. But this is another personal taste thing.\n\nOh, and I hate being a nitpicker like this, but this book needed an editor to trim down things. For example, the characters infodump the same information on Hedge three times in short succession. This is the sort of thing this book's publisher should have picked up. Maybe Nix has reached the stage of his career where his editors don't do a developmental edit on him anymore; I heard that happened to Stephen King so maybe that happened here. To be sure, the book functioned and didn't *need* a developmental edit, but a good dev edit would have smoothed out some of the unevenness.\n\nAgain, overall I very much so enjoyed this. I had a pleasant time and can heartily recommend it to anyone who read the original series. It's not the most spectacular book I've ever read, but I'll re-read this and I'll be happy every time.\n\nSummary\n\nLooking back on the series, I have mixed feelings. Growing up, 'Sabriel' and 'Lirael/Abhorsen' were some of my favorite stories. They largely hold up on modern re-read. The rest of the series is a bit touch and go. 'Terciel and Elinor' is good, 'Clariel' isn't good, while 'Goldenhand' is another example of vanilla pudding; I'm happy to eat it but it's not memorable.\n\nThere's something iconic in how Sabriel in 'Sabriel' discovers a bunch of decapitated Ancelstierran soldier corpses right after she crosses the Wall for the first time; it gave me as a reader a moment of 'oh shit this book is playing for keeps.' The series is at it's best when it leans into that almost grimdark element. 'Sabriel' was the first Dark Fantasy book I ever read, and it got me hooked on the genre for life.\n\nI personally feel that 'Clariel' and 'Goldenhand' didn't have that dark element, and suffered for it. 'Terciel and Elinor' DID WORK, because it brought home early on the danger and darkness of the setting.\n\nAnyway, that's my 2cents. Think for yourself."

Having a curmudgeonly older woman as a main character is a nice change of pace. Well, I'm pretty sure she's only in her 30s, but 30s was \u201colder\u201d for a commoner in medieval Bruges.\n\nThis is a revised edition of the book previously published as *Armed in Her Fashion* in 2018, and according to the [content note](https://kateheartfield.com/content-note-the-chatelaine/), has \"much less misgendering\" of the trans character than the first edition. I picked up the original from the library to compare, and it's pretty yikes. Claude is a trans man, and in both versions, he's introduced as male and his third person limited sections gender him correctly, but in the original, he's referred to as a \"girl\" in all other characters' sections, both in their thoughts and *by the third person narration*. There's no way I would have finished the book with that version (gendering the trans character correctly *in the narration* is the bare minimum), let alone rated it positively. In *The Chatelaine*, the only times he's misgendered are in dialogue, some of the dialogue mentions are made neutral, and most of the main characters gender Claude correctly in general. With those simple changes, the representation is surprisingly good. It really goes to show how literally just gendering the character correctly goes so far, but hey, it's cool to see the author learning from her mistakes and I'm glad it got fixed.\n\n**Sovereign by April Daniels (Superheroes HM, trans female and nonbinary characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nA solid sequel to *Dreadnought*. Danny is impulsive, angry, and resilient and I love her (>!and I'm very glad she's gonna go get some therapy after this!<).\n\nTrans author. In addition to the trans lesbian main character Danny aka Dreadnought, we also get a nonbinary/genderqueer side character Kinetiq. It may be partly due to the types of books I've been reading this year, but I've been noticing more books with multiple trans characters and I really like that. For one, it helps represent a diversity of trans experiences, but also, most trans people nowadays do interact with other trans people at some point, and there are a lot of interesting interpersonal dynamics involved in that. Kinetiq is a bit of a punk/anti-capitalist trans stereotype, but I don't mind because I personally know people are the same, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s well known outside the trans community anyways. Danny deals with some on-page transphobia and misgendering >!(plus literal torture)!< from the TERF villain Greywytch, but I think it's handled well and doesn't come off as \"trans trauma porn.\" This is partly because we experience it from Danny's POV, and she treats Greywytch with exactly the contempt she deserves, plus the >!torture!< happens early in the book for not-entirely-trans-related reasons and helps set up some arcs (rather than at the end of the book for \"impact\" as it would be with trauma porn). I also thought it was funny how Danny's idea at the end to >!use the wealth confiscated from the billionaire supervillain to provide free transition services!< is basically the same idea as in *Future Feeling* by Joss Lake (>!where a billionaire's kid makes free trans healthcare widely available!<).\n\n**The Will to Battle by Ada Palmer (Bottom of the TBR HM, nonbinary character, genderless culture)**  \\-  5\\*\n\n*The Will to Battle* is the third book in the Terra Ignota series, and had been on my TBR since 2017. It wasn't the absolute bottom of my SFF TBR (that honor goes to *Words of Radiance* by Brandon Sanderson, added in 2015), but it was the third oldest, and the oldest that fit my theme. I originally wanted to wait for the series to be completed before reading, but by the time the fourth and final book rolled out in 2021, it just wasn't a priority anymore, especially since these books are dense and complex and philosophical, making them hard to just pick up on a whim. But I'm thankful for the nudge to finally read them, because once I started back up, I was hooked all over again.\n\nThis series is set in a society where everybody uses they/them pronouns and gender is a taboo subject, so the concept of being transgender doesn't exist. If I had to identify some explicit rep, I would point to Sniper, who would almost certainly fall under our modern definition of nonbinary (which usually falls under the trans umbrella because in our current society, nonbinary people inherently have a gender different from the one assigned to them at birth, but that definition breaks down a bit in a society which does not assign genders at all, let alone at birth). Sniper likes using the \"it\" pronoun instead of the standard \"them\", though they're not sure if they want it for everyday use by strangers/acquaintances (hence why I will use they/them). At the end of the series, >!they get put in charge of a committee to study gender for the first time in centuries and decide whether to re-integrate it into society. Their initial thinking is to start with research, particularly with the divisions in sporting competitions that replaced gender-segregated sports (they are an Olympic athlete so it makes sense they would think to start there, but ugh I'm so tired of the whole trans-people-in-sports debate). They also propose a program for people to take a year to explore gender and talk to others about what gender means, which I think would be pretty cool.!<\n\n**Dead Collections by Isaac Fellman (Magical Realism HM, trans male and nonbinary characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nIt's a bit rambly in parts, but it's refreshing and actually hits the cozy/heartwarming vibe better than a lot of books I've tried that specifically target that \"cozy fantasy\" niche. I like the take on vampirism-- Sol's vampirism is more like a chronic illness than anything, and used as a treatment/life extension for terminal conditions; instead of getting super-speed, bodily changes happen in slow motion. This is a perfect fit for Mundane Jobs, especially because the author is an archivist IRL, but unfortunately it's not HM for that so I shoved it in the only other slot I could justify it in.\n\nTrans author. The main character Sol is a trans man. He became a vampire at a year on T, and his changes have slowed to a crawl, leaving him stuck long term in that weird middle ground of not-quite-passing (which happens to plenty of people without vampirism involved). He meets and befriends a fellow Jewish trans man at the blood bank. He falls in love with a person >!who turns out to be questioning their own gender (and ends up settling on nonbinary). I liked getting to see Sol's doubts and dysphoria as Else explores their masculinity while he still supports their exploration and affirms their new understanding of their gender. I'm always wary of books that focus on the cis partner/relative/friend of a trans person, because they so often end up either misgendering or tokenizing the trans person, or trivializing their suffering in favor of the cis person who has it oh-so-hard dealing with a trans partner/relative/friend. But it really can be tough to adjust to someone you know transitioning, so it was nice to see it from Sol's perspective, even if it could have been explored in more depth.!< Fellman also tries to tie being trans to fanfiction writing but doesn't dig too deep into it other than some surface-level stuff about exploring repressed gender feelings through slash fic. I did see some reviews that accuse the book of being lesbophobic for having a transphobic butch lesbian and a lot of lesbian characters that end up being trans (like >!Else!<) or possibly-trans (like >!Else\u2019s dead wife!<), but I think this is just a side effect of having a limited cast and a strong focus on the experiences of transmascs who used to be lesbians. It's not trying to erase lesbians, it's just not really about them, and that's ok. Anyways, some of the themes/connections could have been explored more, but I think the rep is great overall. Plus it's got one of the best trans one-liners I've seen in print (\"God misheard my very simple request, so he made me a pianist\") and a possible nod to the Terry Pratchett book \"Feet of Clay\" (which introduced trans-coded female dwarfs).\n\n**Their Heart A Hive by Fox N Locke (YA HM, nonbinary character)**  \\-  3\\*\n\nI liked the slice of life bits, but wasn't invested in the overarching mystery/plot. I was hoping it would be cozier, but I've been struggling to find books that hit that *Legends and Lattes* niche quite right.\n\nTrans author. There's a genderqueer Lord and Lady of Honeymoore Manor. For most of the book, they seem to be a fairly standard form of genderfluid, swapping between male and female on a regular basis (though not always completely gender-conforming). At the end, it's revealed that they're >!an immortal who has faked their death many times to pose as different people throughout the years, with various names and genders, though none of them fit perfectly. After revealing this, they choose a new name meaning \"daughter of the stone, son of the sea\" and announce themself to be both lord and lady at once (with our modern terminology, they would be considered bigender).!< The rep is fine overall, though it is some of the most binary nonbinary rep I've ever seen, and that's not a compliment.\n\n**The Healers' Home by S E Robertson (Mundane Jobs HM, trans female character)**  \\-  3\\*\n\nThis book didn't hit the cozy slice of life vibe as nicely as the first book in the series, which was disappointing. I found Kei's point of view extremely frustrating to read, with his self-hatred and completely illogical negativity. I'm not planning to read the next book in the series. Fun fact\u2014 I was the 100th person to rate this book on Goodreads, so I'm sorry if anybody wanted to use it for Self-published HM.\n\nTrans author. Agna's Aunt Naire is a trans woman (note she has a very small role and I don't think she even gets any direct page time, so this wouldn't necessarily count if you're trying to sub the 2021 bingo square in somewhere). Unfortunately, it's mentioned exclusively in the context of her medical transition making her \"more susceptible\" to certain kinds of cancer. There's a common myth that hormone therapy is \"dangerous\" and increases the risk of cancer, though this is NOT supported by medical research ([source 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214623715000496), [source 2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cen.13835), [source 3](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/827713)). I've seen a lot of parents (some well-meaning but misinformed, some blatantly transphobic) try to stop their kids from getting life-saving medical treatment because of it. Given the harm this myth causes to real-life trans people, I think it's irresponsible to legitimize it even in a fantasy setting.\n\n**The Bone Doll's Twin by Lynn Flewelling (Published in the 00s HM, gender swap shenanigans but no explicit trans rep)**  \\-  5\\*\n\nI liked this enough that I binged the whole series. No particular book in the trilogy stands out as a 5\\* on its own, but I'll give the series a 5 for being consistently well-executed throughout. I liked the characters, and I liked the relationship dynamics, particularly between Tobin and the other noble kids in the Companions.\n\nWhile I found books exploring nonbinary genders through aliens and far-future worlds in every decade from the 60s to 90s, the options for the 00s were pretty limited. Tobin/Tamir was born female, had their body magically transformed into their murdered twin brother's body, and was raised as a boy before ultimately learning that they are \"really\" a girl and physically transforming back to their original body (I don't think this much is a spoiler as the general story arc is obvious very early on). They're not really trans as we would understand it, but they do go through some similar experiences to trans people. The books generally use he/him pronouns before the transformation, and she/her pronouns after (which makes sense within the story but isn't good practice for most real-life trans people), so I'll just use they/them for simplicity. Tobin/Tamir doesn't show any \"signs\" other than liking dolls and *like-liking* boys. They seem to like their male body, are resistant to the idea of being/becoming a girl, and >!actively miss their penis after it's gone (though it's not clear if that's due to their residual connection to Brother, which causes \"phantom penis\" sensations and is removed/resolved at the very end of the trilogy)!<, but also >!seem to accept being a woman at the end!<. It's not really clear how they would \"identify\" if given the choice, as neither the author nor any of the characters show any awareness of the possibility of being trans. I would've liked to see Tobin/Tamir connect more to other female characters-- there's a hint of it in the way they >!relate to the ghost of the first Queen Tamir, but their friend Una was criminally under-utilized!<. The most relatable part was actually the other characters' reactions to Tobin/Tamir's transformation, in particular Ki (the best friend/love interest) with his struggle to adjust. So overall, the identity aspects were super under-developed by modern standards, but whatever, it was the early 00s. \n\n**When the Angels Left the Old Country by Sacha Lamb (Angels and Demons HM, nonbinary nonhuman character)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nThis was a fun, easy read with wonderfully endearing characters. I loved the idea of an angel and a demon as chavrusa (Talmud study partners). It was nice to learn some new Yiddish vocab and Jewish mythology.\n\nTrans author. The angel is genderless and uses it/it/its pronouns. It chooses to look like a man for convenience (since women weren't often able to study freely at the time), and it doesn't particularly mind being misgendered. While this was pretty unique, it doesn't really feel like representation because for much of the book, the angel is very non-human and does not think in human ways. However, I did like that even as it takes on a permanent name and becomes more human-like in its thoughts, it remains genderless. The angel and the demon are very close and implied to be more than \"just\" friends, but their relationship isn't necessarily romantic and certainly isn't sexual-- they could equally be interpreted as close friends, as a romantic couple, or as a queerplatonic partnership, which is cool because you don't often see that kind of ambiguous close relationship represented.\n\n**Transmogrify!: 14 Fantastical Tales of Trans Magic edited by g haron davis (Five Short Stories HM, nonbinary, trans male, and trans female characters)**  \\-  3\\*\n\nThis is feel-good trans wish fulfillment, and felt like a spiritual successor to my trans bingo anthology from 2021, *No Man of Woman Born*. Quality-wise, it was a bit of a mixed bag, as anthologies often are, and a lot of the morals/endings were a bit too simple/convenient for my taste, but I enjoyed it overall. My favorites were \"Dragons Name Themselves\" by A R Capetta and Cory McCarthy and \"Espejismos\" by Dove Salvatierra. My least favorites were \"Bite the Hand\" (1\\*/DNF since the writing style just didn't work for me) and \"The Door to the Other Side\" (2\\* since I finished it, but I really disliked the handling of suicide, especially with its placement as the last story of the book). There were a lot of Harry Potter/JK Rowling references, and a few stories seemed like direct attempts to reclaim certain tropes (e.g. magic schools, broomstick sports).\n\nTrans authors. Story by story, the written representation itself was great, all the way down to the details. It's at the macro level where this anthology suffers. Out of 14 stories, 11 had nonbinary main characters, 1 had a trans girl, 1 had a trans boy, and 1 had dual nonbinary and transmasc protagonists. All of the authors seem to be nonbinary (at least based on their pronouns listed in the bios). Nowhere in the synopsis or marketing is this nonbinary focus acknowledged. I feel like the editors/publishers should have looked at this and gone \"whoops, we accidentally made a nonbinary anthology, let's pivot.\" For a general trans anthology that specifically sets out to represent \"many different genders and expressions and experiences\" to include so little binary representation feels like it's saying that binary trans people either don't have a variety of experiences/expressions or don't need/deserve representation. A lot of the characters' struggles were also very straightforward \"nonbinary person finds/makes a place for themself in a binary world,\" which got a bit repetitive.\n\n**The Spirit Bares Its Teeth by Andrew Joseph White (Horror HM, trans male and female characters)**  \\-  5\\*\n\nI ended up having more YA on this board that I would have liked, just because there's comparatively a lot of trans rep in YA and my choices were limited on some of the squares. I had a bad YA run right before reading this and almost replaced it, but I'm glad I didn't because this was actually really fucking good. I loved the Victorian London setting with a spirit-based magic system.\n\nTrans author. The main character, Silas, is a trans boy. I loved how [Dr. James Barry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Barry_(surgeon)) (a real-life trans man from the early 1800s) is featured as an inspiration for Silas. Silas is autistic, which was also exciting to see because people who are trans are more likely to be autistic than the general population, but I hadn't seen that intersection represented until this year. He meets both a fellow trans person (Daphne, a trans girl and his betrothed) and a fellow autistic person for the first time in this book, and I think the way he sees himself reflected in them really hammers in the importance of representation. I think White also does a good job of highlighting the hazy border between dysphoria about a feature and dysphoria about how society views that feature. For example, before Silas meets Daphne, he's absolutely disgusted by the idea of pregnancy, to the point of researching and fantasizing doing a hysterectomy on himself. After he meets her, he realizes that he \"doesn't actually know how much of \\[his\\] fear and revulsion is linked to the world's inherent gendering of everything reproductive.\"\n\n**Body After Body by Briar Ripley Page (Self-Published HM, trans male and female characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nI quite enjoyed this fever dream of a novel. I don't think it'll ever enjoy mainstream success, and I honestly wouldn't recommend it to most people, but it's a quick read, so if you're in that niche where queer (both in the \"weird\" sense and in the \"trans/LGBT\" sense) anti-capitalist body horror appeals to you and you're fine with some weird sex and vulgar language, maybe give it a shot.\n\nTrans author. This book is set in a future where poor people can access advanced medical care by selling themselves into 7 years of indentured servitude (only a slight exaggeration of the current American healthcare system) with their memories wiped. This deal includes medical transition, but only one-size-fits-all binary transitions, and only people who can fully \"pass\" afterwards are accepted. Even with those stipulations, it's stated that about 89% of the indentured servants are trans. All four of the main characters (3 men, 1 woman) transitioned in this way, though one of them didn't get a fully binary transition despite wanting one (because plot reasons), and another one would have preferred a less binary transition if he were given the option. It's mentioned that rich people have other transition options including nonbinary body mods available, though the general public seems to be transphobic overall. There's some on-page transphobia, mostly in flashbacks as the memory-wiped laborers regain their memories, but it wasn't gratuitous. The book uses terminology that many trans people may find uncomfortable-- for example transsexual/cissexual and references to a trans man's >!cunt!<\\-- but at the same time, some trans people do use these terms to describe themselves. Personally, knowing the author's identity is important to me in this situation; I would not feel comfortable with a cis author using those terms, but I'm okay with it from a trans author. On a separate note, I've been seeing a lot of trans authors writing monsters and body horror, and it makes a lot of sense-- you know, something about the experience of being vilified by society and/or feeling disconnected from (or even disgusted by) one's own body leads a person towards certain themes.\n\n**The Bruising of Qilwa by Naseem Jamnia (Middle-East HM, nonbinary and trans male characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nA quick read, it brings up some interesting questions for the reader to chew on but doesn't quite have the page length to explore the answers. I really liked the dynamic of Firuz (the main character) and Afsoneh (their blood magic student)-- I've read plenty of stories from the perspective of the young, naturally gifted protege impatient with their older, more knowledgeable but less powerful mentor, but I've rarely seen it from the POV of the mentor.\n\nTrans author. The main character Firuz is nonbinary, their younger brother Parviz is a trans boy, and there are mentions of minor characters using a few different kinds of neopronouns. Firuz and Parviz come from Dilmun, a queernormative culture where people are introduced with their pronouns (as in, they-Firuz or he-Parviz) and medical transition is readily available, but they are currently refugees in Qilwa, where gender-affirming medical treatment is not readily available. Firuz medically transitioned in Dilmun, and is trying to learn the spells to help Parviz to medically transition as well-- in particular, they are trying to learn to perform a version of top surgery, as Parviz has severe chest dysphoria. This dynamic hits pretty hard at a time (May 2023) when some states in the US are passing laws to limit access to medical transition, which tend to affect younger trans people and people trying to start transition more than older, post-transition folks, and I think Jamnia did a great job of showing Parviz's frustration and desperation and anger.\n\n**The Chromatic Fantasy by HA (Published in 2023 HM, trans male characters)**  \\-  5\\*\n\nI'm not usually a big fan of graphic novels, but I really liked this. It's whimsical and earnest, the gay romance was cute, and the fantasy trappings (cloaks and castles and all that jazz) in riotous color are exactly my aesthetic.\n\nTrans author. The main characters, Jules and Casper, are two trans men in a relationship with each other, and there's a minor character labeled with she/they pronouns. There are several explicit sex scenes, and I think the author is good at making them look masculine even when drawing them naked without having had any gender-affirming surgeries. I liked the personification of Jules's self-doubts-- in particular, there's a rant about Jules's relationship with his genitals that feels way too specific to be completely made up, which makes the representation feel very personal and real.\n\n**The Last Echo of the Lord of Bells by John Bierce (Multiverse HM, nonbinary and trans female characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nA solid ending to a great series. The number of side character POV chapters was a little indulgent, but it had plenty of the imaginative uses of magic and cute found family vibes that I love the series for. Note: There are *some* doors that lead to other worlds in this multiverse, but I consider this HM because doors aren't the main way to travel between worlds, and I feel like traveling to a different plane via labyrinth is a sufficiently unique method that this deserves HM. And technically, I don't think anybody ever walks through a door to another world in this book (though one character *flies* through one).\n\nI read this book without having planned to use it for bingo and was pleasantly surprised to find some trans rep. There's a prominent nonbinary side character, Shimmering Cardovan, and a minor trans woman (well, minor in prominence, but major in power), Threadqueen Iblint. Shimmering Cardovan is tall, muscular, and bearded, and I appreciate the representation that people can use they/them pronouns without being physically androgynous. Though they're also very flamboyant, and control rainbow gemstones with their magic, so they'd still be considered very queer-presenting by our world's standards. Threadqueen Iblint is the second character in the series noted to have trained in magic to a high level in order to physically transition (the first was Zophor, a mangrove lich briefly mentioned in this book), which implies that medical transition isn't easily available in this world.\n\n**Dawn by Octavia Butler (POC Author HM, nonbinary aliens)**  \\-  5\\*\n\nThis is science fiction at its best. It's got strong themes (consent/control/freedom) and one of the most truly alien depictions of an alien species that I've ever read. I read the whole series back-to-back-to-back.\n\nThe Oankali have three sexes, male, female, and ooloi. Ooloi and ungendered children are properly referred to using it/its pronouns, though a lot of the human characters struggle with this and end up using he or she pronouns instead. Oankali children are not sexed or gendered until they reach puberty, and their adult sex depends on their childhood experiences-- children tend to become the same sex as their favorite parent, and the opposite sex of their closest sibling. So in a way, all Oankali children get some amount of choice in their adult sex. In later books, there's a mention of some Oankali-human construct children developing into a different sex than would be expected based on their childhood appearance, but there's no acknowledgement of human LGBT+ diversity.\n\n**The Final Strife by Saara El-Arifi (Book Club HM, nonbinary and trans female characters, trinary-gender culture)**  \\-  3\\*\n\nThe only major character I really liked was Hassa. Sylah was okay, but Anoor was actively annoying. They didn't have much chemistry and I skimmed through a lot of the romantic bits, but to be fair I find myself doing that a lot when reading YA-- and despite the fact that Sylah and Anoor are 20, and my local library shelves this as \"adult,\" it very much reads like a YA novel. The one part of the romance I did like was how >!Anoor cut off the relationship after learning just how much Sylah lied to her about\u2014 but I'm sure they'll end up just getting back together in book 2!<. I won't be continuing with this series.\n\nThe Wardens' Empire is queernormative, with a trinary gender system of men, women, and musawa. Their god Anyme is musawa, there are several musawa minor characters, and the tritagonist Hassa is a trans girl. The trans inclusion in the world-building felt very surface-level and tacked-on. For example, it's explicitly mentioned out that musawa can use any pronouns, and that anybody can identify as any gender without physically transitioning, which is great, but there's no mention of any way that people might signal their correct gender/pronouns to others, and we never see anybody ask for another person's pronouns. There aren't any musawa-specific terms mentioned for things you might expect like family relations (e.g. mother/father, etc), lady/gentleman, boy/girl, etc. It is mentioned that hormone herbs and gender-affirming surgeries are widely available, but it doesn't make much sense that the oppressed Ghosting servant caste would have easy access to affirming surgeries when they're not allowed to have *hands* or *tongues* (the Embers literally cut them off at birth) and are forced to work as soon as they can walk. That said, I'd rather have a lazy attempt at queernormativity than an even lazier imposition of real-world transphobia.\n\n**Werecockroach by Polenth Blake (Novella HM, nonbinary and trans female characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nThis is exactly the kind of story that works well as a novella; there's a fun premise with the werecockroaches and the alien invasion, some solid themes about misfits and found families, and it doesn't overstay its welcome and make you question the logistics too much. I liked Rin's dry humor a lot.\n\nTrans author. The main character Rin is agender, asexual, and aromantic, a combination sometimes referred to as AAA (triple-A, as in the batteries). I don't remember ever reading another book with a AAA character, so it was cool seeing that represented for the first time, especially with Rin being poor and a person of color, attributes which also tend to be underrepresented among trans characters. I liked how all of Rin's identity labels are mentioned explicitly in the book, but in a way that made sense and felt natural. >!Their friend Addie is a Jamaican-British trans woman, but we the audience don't learn she's trans until the epilogue/extra short story from her perspective, which is cool to see. A lot of trans people are not openly trans, either because they are closeted (they live as the gender they were assigned at birth) or stealth (they live fully as their true/target gender), but it can obviously be tough to represent this when all other characters believe they are cis. The best way I know of to represent closeted/stealth trans characters is to give insight into the trans character\u2019s POV as done with Addie. Another option is to go the \u201cDumbledore is gay\u201d route and reveal the character\u2019s trans status outside of the text. I\u2019ve seen this in The Fated Sky by Mary Robinette Kowel, and while I prefer that over shoehorning in an outing scene, it can make the rep feel \u201ctacked-on\u201d or unsubstantiated.!<\n\n**Dear Mothman by Robin Gow (Mythical Beasts HM, trans male characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nA very sweet book about grief, loneliness, acceptance, and growing up. I'm not generally a big fan of poetry-- I probably would've liked the story better in prose-- but I loved Noah's development, and getting attached to the characters is usually one of the most important factors in my enjoyment of any given book. \n\nTrans author. The main character, Noah, is an autistic trans boy whose best friend Lewis (also a trans boy) recently died in a car crash. Noah and Lewis were out only to each other, so he has to navigate the loss of affirmation of his identity in addition to his grief. I didn't relate to everything about Noah's experience, but some of the details hit hard, like the way he feels like nobody but Lewis really knows who he is. I liked the connections/themes drawn around trans people as \"monsters\" (\"It seems to me that 'monsters' are almost always misunderstood-- that 'monster' is what people become when other people are afraid of them for being different. People like me are called monsters sometimes.\"). I also liked how Noah and Lewis were friends before either of them realized they were trans-- I know it seems unlikely on the face of it, but it's a real phenomenon where unrealized queer/trans people are drawn to each other without even knowing what they have in common.\n\n**The Sunbearer Trials by Aiden Thomas (Elemental Magic HM, trans male and nonbinary characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nThis is a solid YA book with some fun characters and fun superpowers. The plot is a bit predictable at times, but I'm interested to see how things progress with the next book.\n\nTrans author. This book has a trans boy main character, several trans side characters including a nonbinary god, and a queernormative setting with mentions of readily available hormone therapy and top surgery. I liked how Teo was a role model for Xio\u2014 finding trans mentors/role models is really important to a lot of young and/or early-transition trans people, and I don't think we see that represented often enough. I liked how Teo's wing color was relevant to his transition, but I think the way it was resolved was a bit too convenient. I liked how Ocelo is allowed to be nonbinary and a jerk without those things being related. I know those of us who grew up with the queer-coded villain trope may be nervous or skeptical at the prospect, but variety is important for representation, and to me, that includes representing the fact that trans people can be assholes-- not because they're trans, but because they're human. It's also interesting that this is the third book I've read this year that includes a nonbinary deity (Bruising of Qilwa, Final Strife, Sunbearer Trials)-- perhaps it's the other side of the coin to the theme of nonbinary priests/monks from my last trans bingo.\n\n**The Wicked Bargain by Gabe Cole Novoa (Myths and Retellings HM, transmasc and nonbinary characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nThis is another solid YA book, and honestly very comparable to *The Sunbearer Trials*\\-- I read them back to back, and they would have benefited from more separation. I found Mar's hesitancy to use his powers frustrating (I'm glad Teo's hangups were resolved much earlier in his book). It made sense given his backstory, but it's just not a plotline I personally care for. I did like the Caribbean setting a lot though.\n\nTrans author. The main character Mar prefers gender-neutral forms of address, but while feminine terms feel completely wrong for them, \"man\" is \"not quite right, but \\[...\\] not entirely wrong\" and boy \"feels better-- good, even-- though it's not completely right, either.\" They're fine with he/him pronouns, and prefer to pass as a boy-- if the book were solely from another character's perspective, they would probably seem like a binary trans boy. Nonbinary transmasc guys like Mar are very common and very underrepresented. I've met a ton of trans people who use terms like \"nonbinary man\" or \"demiboy,\" or who identify with terms like \"guy\"/\"boy\"/\u201dboi\u201d but not \"man,\" yet nonbinary representation is still very much dominated by androgynous agender/genderqueer types or genderfluid/bigender types. In fact, the major secondary character Dami is a genderfluid demonio of the latter group (in this world, demons are >!humans who have sold their souls, so they're still human!<) with shapeshifting powers. They're characterized as being very attractive, but well, it's YA, so everybody of a certain age is attractive.\n\n**River of Teeth by Sarah Gailey (Queernorm HM, nonbinary character)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nThe story itself is solid, but it's the basic premise of hippo wranglers in the 1890s Louisiana bayou that really sells this.\n\nTrans author. One of the main characters, Hero, is nonbinary. They're pretty cool, they get a nice romance. I forgot to write this review for several months so my goldfish brain is blanking on the details, but I remember liking the rep overall.\n\n**The Thirty Names of Night by Zeyn Joukhadar (Coastal or Island Setting HM, trans male and nonbinary characters)**  \\-  5\\*\n\nIt was a little hard to get into at first (I often struggle with books with multiple narratives), but the prose was lovely and I ultimately liked it a lot. I saw a review describing it as \"intimate\" and I thought that was a very fitting description.\n\nTrans author. The main character is a transmasc person just beginning to socially transition, and he chooses his name (Nadir) partway through the book. His transition is a major plotline in this story, but it's far from the only thing going on in his life. There's also a secondary nonbinary character, Qamar, and a trans boy mentioned in the past (Laila's notebook) storyline, >!Ilyas!<. As mentioned, I always love seeing trans people connecting with each other. It was especially cool to see the connection between Nadir and >!Ilyas!<, because trans people in history are so often erased. I loved the descriptions of dissociation; it's often overlooked in favor of the more dramatic and overly painful forms for dysphoria. I like the way Nadir's birth name is always scribbled out, making it clear that it's purposefully hidden from the reader. I loved seeing him navigate his nonbinary identity (\"I want to tell Reem that maybe I am something there is no word for \\[instead of a boy\\], but I am afraid that I am already invisible enough to her as it is\")-- he's similar to Mar from *The Wicked Bargain* in that he publicly comes out as a boy but privately feels nonbinary. I love the themes of names and naming, both in a trans context and in a cultural/immigrant context.\n\n**Flowerheart by Catherine Bakewell (Druid HM, trans female and nonbinary characters)**  \\-  3\\*\n\nWell, it's another YA novel with a magical protagonist afraid of their own powers. I'm really not a fan of this \"super powerful but hindered by anxiety/trauma\" trope, and in general I find it frustrating to read anxious/illogical thought patterns. It also just didn't hit the cozy vibe as much as I wanted.\n\nClara's favorite former teacher, Madam Ben Ammar, and her apprentice Robin are both trans. Neither of them gets a ton of screen time, but Robin mentions to Clara that they're glad that they have a trans mentor to relate with. On one hand, I like that even with the trans representation being so peripheral, we still get two characters with a hint at how their shared experiences affect their mentor/apprentice dynamic. On the other hand, the whole interaction just feel weird and stilted and poorly executed overall. It also feels iffy to be learning that Madam Ben Ammar is trans secondhand from Robin when it's not entirely clear if Clara knew about her trans status beforehand, but that's partly projection on my part. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that this isn't an issue for the characters in question within the queernormative setting of the book, but in the real world, outing people like that is a big faux pas unless you have explicit permission from the trans person in question.\n\n**System Collapse by Martha Wells (Robots HM, genderless non-human characters)**  \\-  4\\*\n\nI struggled with getting back into this because it picks up right from the end of *Network Effect*, and it had been a while since I read that. Other than that, this was a great addition to the Murderbot series, and I loved getting to see some of that slow burn character development coming through.\n\nMurderbot is a genderless robot-human construct. I think it's in a similar boat to the angel in *When the Angels Left the Old Country* in that it's not really great representation for human gender diversity, because it's not clear how much of its gender (or lack thereof) comes from its non-human side.\n\n**Come Tumbling Down by Seanan McGuire (Sequel HM, trans male character)**  \\-  3\\*\n\nI've enjoyed most of the other Wayward Children books but had been putting this one off because I wasn't a big fan of Jack and Jill or The Moors in general. It was about what I expected. It was fun enough and quick enough that it was worth reading just for the completionist in me, but it felt gratuitous.\n\nOne of the side characters, Kade, is a trans boy who has been featured in several Wayward Children books so far. He doesn't do a ton in this book, but I like him as a character. McGuire has stated (link in comments) that she plans to write his origin story, but Kade is a boy/man \"who will honestly and unflinchingly say that once, he was a little girl,\" so the beginning of his story will have a lot of misgendering and deadnaming, and given \"as little good trans rep as we have,\" she doesn't want to fuck it up. Some trans people (like Kade) do refer to their past selves as their assigned gender, most trans people prefer either gender-affirming or gender-neutral language even when talking about the past. So I understand McGuire's reservations, especially as a cis author who may not get the automatic benefit of the doubt that a trans author might. That said, I've read enough of her work and enough different trans stories in general that I personally would trust her to tell Kade's story well."

In the afterglow of this annihilation, George Orr went to sleep. When he woke up, he woke up safe in his bed in a completely non-destroyed world. George Orr, merely by dreaming, changed the world.\n\nGeorge is cursed. His dreams rarely go as expected. When he was a boy, George's aunt attempted sexual assault against him. The next morning, she was dead, and she'd been dead for weeks. He didn't mean to kill her, because George cannot control his dreams; his unconscious mind simply wished her gone, so she died. \n\nA lifetime of trauma follows, culminating in drug abuse with his attempts to avoid dreaming at all cost. Eventually, he winds up a victim of the legal system, and is forced by the government to seek therapy from a therapist. Dr. Haber is a well meaning therapist; he earnestly wants what's best for his patients. Unfortunately, Haber is a control freak. \n\nHaber realizes very early on the utility of Orr's god-like power. Orr can't control his power on his own, but with Haber's hypnosis techniques, Haber can control the world.\n\nSpoilers Below. I'm writing this review in good faith, as one author reviewing another's book, trying to balance positives with negatives.\n\n**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE? WHAT GENRES? WHAT MAJOR TROPES?**\n\n* Daoism!\n* Morality SciFi\n* Hypnosis and dreaming and psychic powers\n* Reality warping.\n* Classic SciFi\n* Anyone 12+\n\n**MY EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**/ **FUN FACTOR**\n\nThis is a re-read for me. I read this once before, when I was \\~14 years old. I've got to admit, the first time I read this it didn't leave an impression. Re-reading it today at 35, it leaves a HUGE impression. This book is excellent. I don't fully agree with it's espoused morality, but this is *so good*.\n\n5 stars, easily. It's easy to understand why this is a classic.\n\nWARNING! QUIT READING NOW UNTIL YOU FINISH READING THE BOOK!\n\n**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**\n\nThis book's concept is: 'It's counterproductive to actively try to force change upon the world from above, like a king commanding a legion of peasants. The more you try to control the world, the more it spins out of control. The correct way is to passively go with the flow, and live life. Also, friendship is magic.'\n\nThis book's execution... is good in one way, and bad in another.\n\nThe good: as an analysis of the daoist principle of going with the flow, it's good! Over the course of the novel, Haber tries harder and harder to 'fix' the world's problems of overpopulation, war, famine. But these attempts result in plague, alien invasions, and worse. This book had a monkey's paw, 'be careful what you wish for' attitude. This was great to read.\n\nThe bad: this book's 'magic system' is literally the protagonist's unconscious mind. Because the protagonist constantly inflicts the world with plague, alien invasions and worse, it makes the protagonist seem like he's deeply depressed and pessimistic. After a certain point, I had my suspension of disbelief disrupted. Doctor Haber is LITERALLY a therapist, he should be able to see depression a mile away. \n\nThe fact that the narrative never once acknowledged that the protagonist was depressed or tried to treat his depression, I was frustrated. Of course his unconscious mind keeps making the world worse; try fixing the depression first, and then the magic will work.\n\n**CHARACTERS, CHARACTERIZATION AND DIALOG**\n\nGeorge Orr was described as being aggressively normal. Equally introverted and extroverted. Equally masculine and feminine. Equally creative and logical. He is so boringly normal, that all the other characters walk all over him. He starts the book devoted to the Yin half of Daoism: going for the course of least resistance, avoiding effort, unwilling to stand up for himself. He's a paradox: cosmic power, and no desire to use it. (When you think of Yin, think of water: it flows, avoiding obstacles.)\n\nDoctor Haber is described as bombastically ambitious. He's a large man: big shoulders, big beard, big voice. He's a man's man, feeling contempt for Orr's flat aspect and vaguely effeminate nature. He's the Yang half of Daoism: going the course of most resistance, constantly striving for power, refusing to accept the world as it is. (Yang is like fire, confronting everything which opposes it.)\n\nAnd then there's Heather. As a lawyer, she's George's ally against the legal system which persecutes him. Heather is half black, half white. She is a living, breathing, thriving woman, with thoughts, opinions of her own. She's George's love interest, but she's not defined by that love. \n\nWhen Haber tries to destroy racism, he winds up destroying Heather. The only way to destroy racism is to change the color of everyone's skin color and make them grey skinned; per force, someone like Heather who proudly embraces her black womanhood, cannot exist in such a world. Haber accidentally deletes Heather from existence. \n\nOne of the book's many themes is that even the best intentions can have unexpected consequences. In retrospect, this is a bit on the nose depiction of race and racism, but it was written 50+ years ago. I think it's neat.\n\nI really liked how the characters are presented. In the West, we're supposed to like Haber. He's strong, he's active, he's trying to make the world a better place. We're supposed to dislike Orr; he's a druggie who squanders powers which he could use for good. But by basing this book's philosophical underpinning on Eastern thought, we're forced to reflect on our presuppositions on what is good and bad.\n\nOkay, now for the bad. Orr kinda sucks.\n\nI get what the author was trying to say, that we should sail with the wind and not against it. But by contrasting extremely boring Orr with vital and vibrant Heather and Haber, Orr comes off looking like a wet blanket. The author wound up resorting to 'telling, not showing' to inform the reader about how cool and awesome Orr is, whereas the author used 'showing, not telling' to talk about how cool Heather and Haber are. 'Show, don't tell' > 'Tell, don't show,' at least in this case. \n\nAs a result, the author's message suffered because Haber was so much cooler than Orr. There are ways to write a Yin character who's not a wet noodle. I feel like LeGuin wrote this improperly. Orr needed agency, and a desire for agency; that desire for agency is compatible with a Daoist worldview. Orr needed to synthesize a Yin worldview and Yang worldview for the end of the book.\n\nProbably the most malfunction-y part about Orr was his character arc. He begins the book HEAVY on the Yin end of the scale. In the beginning, he abuses drugs to avoid his problems; Yin is like water, and water avoids obstacles by flowing around them. At the end of the book, Orr STILL solves his problems by avoiding them, namely by using hypnosis to forget how to effectively dream. \n\nEarly on, his primary motivation was 'I can't use my psychic powers because I don't want to hurt anyone.' After he achieves his apotheosis, his primary motivation was 'I can't use my psychic powers because using it contradicts the flow of the universe.' Orr behaves the exact same way (refusing to use his psychic powers) when he's 'flawed' as well as 'fixed.' His character arc doesn't feel substantial as a result of him behaving the exact same way in beginning and end.\n\nOrr ended up in the wrong place. He needed to learn to balance Yin with Yang. He stayed very Yin.\n\n**PACING AND STRUCTURE**\n\nThis is a short book, only 175 pages. I don't feel like it had much of a deliberate structure to it. It felt like the author wanted to explore the topic of 'let's make the world a better place! And it will go horribly wrong!' from every angle possible. Famine, overpopulation, racism, war... Almost every real world problem, the author explores the idea and shows 'be careful what you wish for.' \n\nAll of these tragedies, were building up to the climax when Haber climbs the Worldtree and becomes a god. Haber remembers the original timeline, when the nuclear apocalypse happens, and incidentally forces everyone else to remember too. This drives thousands of people insane, and turns Haber into something of an eldritch horror. Ultimately, this power is of the unconscious mind; NO ONE can control it, and it was hubris for Haber to think he could try.\n\nAfterwards, Orr does NOT try to reverse the damage Haber caused, like you think a normal hero might. Instead, Orr holds to his desire of going with the flow and rolls with the punches. He lets the world recover naturally from calamity. \n\n**AUTHORIAL VOICE (TONE, PROSE AND THEME)**\n\nI liked the texture of the author's voice. This is a dystopian setting; LeGuin's style deliberately emphasized the grunge and the despair. Even in the cleanest of the alternate timelines, the contrast between light and dark was fascinating and made my skin crawl.\n\nThis book was ideas forward. It's a daoist inspired book, emphasizing going with the flow, embracing change without seeking change. To be in accordance with the Dao is to move without effort, finding meaning in the unspeakable. and paradoxical. To simplify, Daoism is all about going with the flow, and finding a balance between being active and passive. \n\nThis book's concept is the change of Orr personality, going from a Yin focused personality, to a Yin-Yang focused personality. He starts the book avoiding his problems by taking drugs, but he gains a balanced self where he learns to live without seeking to either a) control the world (the fault of Yang) or b) flow away from the world (the fault of Yin). (More on this earlier, I didn't feel this was very well done.) \n\nUltimately, I didn't agree with this book's message completely. Orr was TOO passive. He seemed so beaten down by reality that he's completely lost agency; it got to the point that he seemed to accept the nasty state of the dystopia he lived in. He wasn't willing to fight to change it. \n\nIf it's bad to use magic to change the universe, then what is the good way to make the world a better place? Where is the line between 'good' action and 'bad' action? This book was clear with it's message; you can't fix the world with top-down policies. If top down is bad, why not provide an example of bottom-up being good?\n\nOrr being such a wet blanket kinda wound up hurting the story overall. It feels like this book ended one chapter too soon. It needed a codicil at the end addressing this topic, maybe showing Heather using her law degree to fix the damage Haber caused. Maybe they collect signatures for a democratic initiative. Haber tried to force change, which is bad; by crafting legislation, Orr and Heather flow through the system to cause change, which is good.\n\nTo me, this book feels half-baked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It shows why Yin-only mindframe is bad: instead of confronting your problems, you retreat into drug abuse. \n* It shows why Yang-only mindframe is bad: you seek to exert control over the problems, but do it in a ham-handed and destructive way. \n* This book never attempts a synthesis of Yin and Yang, using a balanced soul to exert agency (as much as you can exert agency in accordance with the Dao) and make the world a better place. \n\nBut there are other ways to interpret the story than just the Daoist message. Here is my alternate reading.\n\nOrr has PTSD. His mental troubles give him depression. Because of his PTSD and depression, he cannot imagine a better world; as a result, whenever he dreams and changes the world, he makes the world subtly worse each and every time. No matter what Haber tries, the seed of depression and PTSD ruins everything he tries. (Note that I'm not a doctor; this is just my uninformed opinion.)\n\nLet's set aside the Daoist philosophy for a moment, and take a more traditional western lens. What if Haber was actually a good therapist and treated Orr's depression? Orr's depression and PTSD were the fly in the ointment, making his dreams into nightmares; with depression and PTSD under control, let his dreams be heavenly.\n\nIf the magic does NOT have a monkey's paw attached to it, why not use it to fix the world for the better?\n\nOnce Orr's depression is treated, Orr's insistence that he doesn't want to change the world is a pessimistic, nihilistic desire to not fix anything which is wrong with the world. People with power are not allowed to sit on the sidelines, because the mere act of not choosing a side is choosing the side of the people in power. Orr's equivocating is the same thing as being pro-famine, pro-disease, pro-war. \n\nWhat a fascinating book. When looked through a Daoist lens, Orr\u2019s stubborn refusal to change the world shows his strength of character. When looked through a more Western lens, Orr\u2019s stubborn refusal to change the world is defeatist and pessimistic. Neither lens is right or wrong.\n\nFinally, the mental illness/PTSD lens.\n\nI theorize that Orr effective dreams as a trauma response. Something hurts him, and by dreaming he unconsciously makes whatever hurt him disappear. Case in point, Orr's aunt tried to sexually assault him; later that night, Orr's effective dreaming retroactively killed his aunt six months earlier, so the attempted sex assault never happened. \n\nHowever, one of the primary causes of PTSD is the sense of loss-of-control. Because effective dreaming is an unconscious process, Orr cannot control it, so it makes sense that Orr has PTSD as a direct response to his own trauma response. Orr is traumatized by external trauma triggers (the attempted sex assault) as well as his own response to that trigger (effective dreaming). \n\nOrr never gains agency over his trauma; instead, the book dabbles in the 'magically healed of your mental disorder' trope. I don't like it when books magically have characters get over their mental disorder; it's not realistic to get better overnight. Hypnosis can be a valid medical technique IRL, but it was used as a shortcut in this book. IRL, there are no shortcuts. This book was problematic in it's depiction of mental illness, but given that this was written in the 1970's, I give it a pass. LeGuin had good intensions.\n\nHow would I re-write this aspect of the book? I would have Orr, after becoming free of abusive Haber, find a non-abusive therapist and actually go through normal therapy. Orr thereby gains self-confidence, self-control and agency over everything which might potentially traumatize him. Maybe he learns Daosist/Buddhist meditation. Because effective dreaming is a defensive trauma response, Orr gaining equanimity will let him confront future traumas without resorting to effective dreaming. Orr never stops *being able* to effective dream; instead he doesn't need effective dreaming anymore as a defensive trauma response. \n\nTo use a metaphor, a patient abuses alcohol to cope with stress. The therapist needs a two-pronged approach: treat the stress first, and the alcoholism will follow. Treat all of Orr's other mental illnesses, and he should spontaneously stop effective dreaming.\n\nThe final idea I saw toyed with was: beware of doctors who are more intent on the science of medicine than on healing people. Haber is an abusive therapist, gaslighting Orr. Orr's effective dreaming is a defensive trauma response; in effect, Haber is traumatizing Orr repeatedly to change the world. Haber's ambition blinds him to the suffering before his eyes. In the end, when Haber tries to effective dream himself, he gives himself a MASSIVE trauma response. \n\n**AUDIOBOOK NOTES**\n\nThis book's narrator is the luminary George Guidall. Check it out, he did great.\n\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\n\nAs an author, I want to improve my own writing/editing skills. To that end, I like to learn lessons from every story I read. Here's what I learned from this story:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Use eastern philosophy to provide contrast to western ideas.\n\n[Here's a link to all the lessons I've previously learned.](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2022/05/06/lessons-learned/)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nA good book, but not without flaw.

The main story is actually quite amazing, there are cutscenes for even small sidequests and events which CDPR didn't need to do but they did anyway, a lot of variety in gameplay with the materials and alchemy system with potion, oils, bombs, and decoctions, the crafting, and even exploiting enemy weakness by reading info about them preparing for a fight.
