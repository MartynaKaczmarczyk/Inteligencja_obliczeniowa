They were especially unhappy with Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski as Geralt and Gra\u017cyna Wolszczak as Yennefer. \u017bebrowski was perceived as (and that's a quote from one member of the committee) \"too much of a sissy\" who's only \"fit to play fragile princes and momma's boys\".\n\nAs for Gra\u017cyna Wolszczak, the criticism wasn't about her appearance, but instead the fact that she has never read Sapkowski's works and most of the characters she played weren't particularly deep or nuanced.\n\nAnother character to be wildly criticised was Dandelion, played by Zbigniew Zamachowski, who's far from the elven-looking poet the readers imagined. The problem was that plenty of the people involved in the production decided to read the comic books instead of the books, and in the comic books, Dandelion was modeled after a real-life writer, disliked by the comic book artist.\n\nWhen the TV show came out, the reception was rather negative, however, the casting was one of the most warmly received parts of the whole production, with \u017bebrowski gaining particular praise.\n\nIn fact, his portrayal of Geralt was so respectable that he received a letter from... Andrzej Sapkowski himself, who wrote him \"You played it EXACTLY as I imagined it should be, but I will never give the rights to Polish movie makers again.\"\n\nIf you've never watched it, I strongly encourage you to give \"The Hexer\" a try. Is it good? No. Is is entertaining?\n\nYES.\n\nThere are things about it that you can genuinely appreciate and there are things that are so bad they're good. Plus, it's worth it just to make your own opinion about it."

Everything you need is probably well described there. Therefore, I will not describe most of the items here, only a few misssing from the post.\n\nSome time ago I decided that if I wanted to come back again to read Sapkowski\u2019s books and play the game trilogy, before the start of The Witcher from Netflix, I could go a step further and acquaint myself with everything that was released under the Witcher brand. Looking through the Reddit in search of a full list of Witcher media, I found myself missing a few noteworthy books developing the lore created by CDPR and a few which are considered non-canonical but were published with the permission of Sapkowski. And this is what this post intends to do; list and describe less known items that are often overlooked, some rightfully, some not so much. So, if you are interested in such, I invite you to read my post.\n\nI divided the items into available in English, Polish only, and miscellaneous - things released under the cdpr license that did not really fit into the main list\n\n## Available in English\n***\n 1.

They kept confusing me, I only remember that Geralt met one of them when he was traveling with Dandelion and Milva, Dandelion started hearing music and then he joined the song.\n\nAnd the last one is the ending. Why did Ciri had to leave when they were around Geralt's body? i thought that the unicorns wanted Ciri to be on her place and time, and did they carried Geralt and Yenefer on the same boat, left them on some place and then Ciri went alone to another place?"

I meant to have it finished by January 2018, if I recall correctly, but to hell with it, life gets in the way sometimes.\n\nBecause of Reddit post size limits, this covers the first three stories. The fourth one was discussed in Part 3, the remaining two will be in Part 5, coming by Friday.\n\nBoth my UK paperback and my UK Kindle file come from the first edition, and at least some of the books have a second edition with some corrections, so bear that in mind.\n\nAlso, a reminder that this guide is highly subjective. Finally, this collection relies on folklore, mythology and such to a much lesser degree, so there's less to explain, which made me unconsciously give up my plan not to go for close reading.\n\nProbably minor spoilers.\n\n\n---\n\n\nBOUND OF REASON\n\n**Important:**\n\n[The cobbler\u2019s story references the tale of the Wawel Dragon.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel_Dragon)\n\n> \u201cYennefer twisted her neck and spat at him, but was wide of the mark. \n\n> \u2018Yen,\u2019 the Witcher said reproachfully, wiping his spit-covered ear on his shoulder. \n\n> \u2018I wish he would stop staring!\u2019 \n\n> \u2018Not on your life,\u2019 Dandelion said, without taking his eyes off the bedraggled sorceress. \u2018I\u2019m here because of her. They may slit our throats, but at least I\u2019ll die happy.\u2019 \n\n> \u2018Shut up, Dandelion,\u2019 the Witcher said.\u201d\n\nA rape joke was removed here. In the original, Dandelion says \u2018we\u2019re here because of her. And they may slit our throats. Worst case scenario, she\u2019ll get raped, which, at her age\u2026\u2019\n\nAlso, the title. \u2018Granica mo\u017cliwo\u015bci\u2019 can mean \u2018Limit/border/end/bound of that which is possible/those things that are possible/the possibility/the possibilities/possibilities\u2026\u2019 Sadly, the singular and plural genitives are the same for \u2018mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107.\u2019 \u2018Potentiality\u2019 is probably a translation, too. Even \u2018chance.\u2019\n\n\n**The rest:**\n\nI\n\n\n* \u2018Pockmarked\u2019 might be too strong, especially given that French calls him \u2018spotty-faced\u2019 a few sentences later, while Sapkowski uses the same word, \u2018one with spots being a defining characteristic,\u2019 consistently.\n\n* The alderman\u2019s eyebrows are thin (as in: with a lot of spacing in between individual hair), not thinning.\n\n> \u201cWe made a deal with a living man, Alderman,\u2019 said the spotty-faced man\u2019s companion, a giant in a leather butcher\u2019s apron. \u2018And now he\u2019s dead, sure as eggs is eggs.\u201d\n\nThe Alderman made the deal, not all of them. Literally \u2018sure as the Sun in the sky.\u2019\n\n> \u201cYou\u2019ve saved yourself a shilling, Alderman,\u2019 the spotty-faced man added. \u2018For there\u2019s no one to pay for the basilisk. So get off home nice and easy. And we\u2019ll take the sorcerer\u2019s horse and chattels.\u201d\n\nA grosz/grosch is being saved, or rather some groszes; it\u2019s could be either, technically, because the locals\u2019 speech is certainly archaic, but the former interpretation would only be correct in dialectal or colloquial Polish. In the more likely, latter case, it\u2019s an expression meaning saving some money. In general, when the word \u2018grosz\u2019 is declined in a non-standard way, it refers to a more significant amount of money.\n\n* Borch first calls the butcher \u2018kocha\u015b,\u2019 which is an \u2018-er\u2019 kind noun related to \u2018to love\u2019 and kind of reminds one of the way you\u2019d say \u2018pick up this soap for me, lover.\u2019\n\n> \u201cYou carry no weapon.\u2019 \n\n> \u2018\u2019Tis true.\u2019 The stranger smiled even more venomously. \u2018I do not.\u2019 \n\n> \u2018That\u2019s too bad.\u2019 The spotty-faced man removed his hand\u2013and with it a long knife\u2013from inside his coat. \u2018It is very unfortunate that you do not.\u201d\n\n\u2018True\u2019 would suffice. As for Borch\u2019s smile, \u2018zjadliwy\u2019 means \u2018malignant\u2019 and (of a disease) highly destructive, it just looks like it would have something to do with venoms. Also notice that the locals use second-person plural to address Borch, while he doesn\u2019t bother. The spotty-faced man simple says \u2018that\u2019s bad, that\u2019s very bad.\u2019\n\n> \u201cHe sprang back, tripping against a collapsed fragment of wall, and looked at the curved, birdlike beak, webbed wings and the hooked talons on the scaly feet. At the swollen dewlap, once crimson, now a dirty russet. And at the glazed, sunken eyes.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s not as bad as in Stok\u2019s translation so far, when Sapkowski uses parallel sentence structure, let him, don\u2019t spoil his rhythm with an unnecessary \u2018and.\u2019\n\n> \u201cThe spotty-faced man was also retreating. The spots on his white face were unpleasantly conspicuous.\u201d\n\nSuddenly whitened face.\n\n\u2018Gaping\u2019 in \u2018gaping dungeon\u2019 is the same word used for \u2018breathing\u2019 in \u2018fire-breathing.\u2019 \n\n* The women\u2019s tattoos are blue.\n\n* \u2018Three Jackdaws\u2019 can also mean \u2018three little coffees.\u2019 The women (called \u2018girls\u2019 or maybe \u2018maidens\u2019 in Polish) are just Vea and Tea in Polish, but of course it\u2019s clear to a Polish reader that the names have two syllables each. Still, umlauts would have done.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n* Crayfish are very popular in Poland and Eastern Europe, or at least they were before industrialisation lowered water quality. I\u2019m torn as to how many of them Borch orders. French did his research and went for three-score, but the word can also just mean \u2018a pile/bunch.\u2019\n\n* Geralt has a kaftan, not a tunic like the one Borch is wearing.\n\n> \u201cPrices are going up, and one has to live, as a sorceress acquaintance of mine used to say.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just easier to make up sayings in Polish. \u2018Wszystko dro\u017ceje, a \u017cy\u0107 trzeba.\u2019\n\n> \u201cIt does,\u2019 Geralt confirmed. \u2018Most often a dream, a wish, a desire, a yearning. Faith that there are no limits to possibility. \u201d\n\nWell, yes, that\u2019s the title.\n\n* Alveaenerle has six syllables if you read it in Polish (although it doesn\u2019t use the letter \u201cv\u201d).\n\nIII\n\n\n* Barefield is a very good translation, although the very rural feel of the original name (on top of it, \u2018Ho\u0142opole\u2019 instead of \u2018Go\u0142opole\u2019 gives it an East Slavic vibe) is necessarily lost. As for the Braa river, wasn\u2019t Sapkowski a bra trader before going into furs? Of course, the Polish word for \u2018bra\u2019 is completely different.\n\n* \u2018Niedamir\u2019 literally means \u2018will-not-leave-alone,\u2019 but it\u2019s not immediately obvious, because people don\u2019t tend to focus on Slavic meanings of names.\n\n* While I know that some disagree, decurion and centurion are not bad translations, I believe. \u2018Dziesi\u0119tnik\u2019 and \u2018setnik\u201d come from \u201cdziesi\u0119\u0107\u2019 and \u2018sto,\u2019 and now that I\u2019ve written it, I see I can\u2019t explain it without a long lesson in Old Slavic phonology.\n\n> \u201cWe wanted to cross the Braa, myself and this knight\u201d\n\n\u2018We wanted to get to the other side of the Braa.\u2019 \n\n* The cobbler\u2019s name means \u2018sheep-eater,\u2019 but sounds very much like \u2018sheep-fucker.\u2019\n\n* \u2018Warlord Nelumbo\u2019s rebellion\u2026\u2019 It was a [rokosz,]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rokosz) he was a [wojewoda,]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivode) as for his name, your guess is as good as mine.\n\n* \u2018It makes me want to laugh and vomit\u2019 Is much more quotable in Polish, but it's hard to explain why. Some mixture of brevity and rhythm, maybe. \u2018\u015amia\u0107 si\u0119 chce i rzyga\u0107.\u2019 Dum-da-dum-da-dum-da. \u2018To-laugh [reflexive] one-wants and to-vomit.\u2019\n\n\nIV\n\n\n* Gyllenstiern\u2019s name reminds one of the Gyllenstiernas, a Scandinavian noble family.\n\n* The joke that Yarpen doesn\u2019t quite remember the word \u2018harmony\u2019 and calls it \u2018harmonium\u2019 is one of Sapkowski\u2019s favourites. It\u2019s originally about coexistence, which he calls \u2018next-to-each-other-xistence\u2019 by changing just one vowel. It\u2019s one of the best Polish puns, out of the total of roughly six you can make.\n\n* \u2018Bordello on wheels\u2019 is an expression meaning complete disorder.\n\n> \u201cWell, Yarpen, do we tell the Witcher?\u2019 \n\n> \u2018Ain\u2019t got nothing against it,\u2019 the dwarf answered.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s a weird choice. It\u2019s probably the most correct and elaborate sentence Yarpen says: \u2018I do not see any contraindications.\u2019\n\n> \u201cIf would be better, Yarpen\u2019\u2013Yennefer narrowed her eyes, turning her head towards the dwarf\u2013\u2018if you kept quiet. From the very first day you\u2019ve been treating me as if I were nothing but air, so please continue, don\u2019t let me bother you. Because it doesn\u2019t bother me either.\u2019\n\n> \u2018Really, m\u2019lady,\u2019 Yarpen\u2019s smile revealed uneven teeth. \u2018May I be infested by ticks, if I haven\u2019t been treating you better than the air. I\u2019ve been known, for example, to spoil the air, which there\u2019s no way I\u2019d dare to do in your presence.\u201d\n\nTreating someone like air is an expression for ignoring. Also, it\u2019s not clear-cut, but there\u2019s a case to be made that Yarpen talks of spoiling Yennefer like one spoils the air.\n\n> \u201cFor inns cost money.\u2019 \n\n> \u2018Beer does too,\u2019 Gar added. \n\n> \u2018And dirty strumpets,\u2019 Beanpole said, daydreaming.\u201d \n\n\u2018For inns cost money.\u2019 / \u2018And beer,\u2019 added Gar. / \u2018And dirty strumpets,\u2019 Beanpole got dreamy.\n\nV\n\n> \u201cShe was wearing just two colours, as usual: black and white.\u201d\n\n\u2018As usual, she was only wearing two colours. Her colours: black and white.\u2019\n\n> \u201cOh, no, my dear. I\u2019m not a slut or an elf-woman met by chance in the forest, who can be discarded in the morning, walked out on without being woken, with a posy of violets left on the table.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not a whore or an elf woman\u2026 Accidentally/Serendipitously caught in a net? What?\n\nVI\n\n> \u201cIn my day, witchers didn\u2019t have two pennies to rub together, just two stinking boots.\u201d\n\nGraceful. Originally: \u2018they did not smell of money, just of footwraps.\u2019 Footwraps were proverbially notorious for their smell.\n\n* Sapkowski makes use of the fact that typhoid fever and typhus traditionally have very different names in Polish. The former is poorly-known, the latter wakes up the memories of the Second World War.\n\nVII\n\n> \u201cthe serpent, the foul dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, will come forth from the abyss! And on his back will sit a woman in purple and scarlet, and a golden goblet will be in her hand, and on her forehead will be written the sign of all and ultimate whoredom!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think it could be translated in a better way. It\u2019s just even funnier in Polish, where the word he uses for 'whore' is extremely vulgar and is extremely out of character for him. For those who don\u2019t know much about Christianity, it\u2019s a very clear reference to the Biblical Book of Revelations, also known as the Apocalypse.\n\n> \u201cI know her!\u2019 Dandelion said, delighted. \u2018It\u2019s Cilia, the wife of the Alderman of Sommerhalder!\u201d\n\nI thought the Alderman\u2019s name was Sommerhalder, but it\u2019s ambivalent.\n\n* The golden dragon is referred to with masculine pronouns, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply anything about its sex at this point, it\u2019s just that \u2018smok\u2019 (which eventually gave NY English the word \u2018shmuck\u2019) is masculine. There\u2019s a separate word for female dragons, but Polish tends to default to masculine nouns in cases of uncertainty, not least because they tend to be shorter, in this case by two syllables, smok-smoczyca.\n\n> \u201cI will not permit knightly honour to be insulted in my presence. Whomsoever dares to violate the principles of this honourable duel\u2026\u201d\n\nWhosoever. Whosoever. How hard can it be?\n\n? \u201cwhomsoever affronts honour, also affronts me, and his or my blood will be shed on this tired earth. The beast calls for a duel?\u201d\n\nI\u2019d go for \u2018tormented earth\u2019 here. \u2018Beast\u2019 or \u2018bestia\u2019 is much more negative in Polish. Also, it hints at an extension of the Apocalypse reference.\n\nVIII\n\n> \u201cYou must have used an entire barrel of mandrake elixir on what I can see, Yennefer,\u2019 the bard laughed. \u2018Your skin\u2019s like a sixteen-year-old\u2019s, dammit.\u201d\n\nHe roughly says \u2018I\u2019ll be damned,\u2019 but it literally means \u2018may a goose pinch me.\u2019 Probably a custom expression\u2026\n\n\n> \u201cRight,\u2019 Boholt rasped, \u2018let\u2019s have at him.\u2019 \n\n> \u2018Oh, no,\u2019 said a deep voice, sounding like a brass trumpet. \u2018I have come to you!\u201d \n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go to him\u2019 / \u2018No, I\u2019ve come to you!\u2019\n\n\n---\n\n\nSHARD OF ICE\n\nII\n\n> \u201cAs usual it was anything but ordinary.\u201d\n\nA play on words. \u2018Jak zwykle by\u0142o niezwykle.\u2019 'As ordinary, it was extraordinary,' pretty much.\n\nIII\n\n> \u201cShe was present in those objects. She was present in the fragrance. \n\n> But she was not there.\u201d \n\n\u2018Present\u2019 is jarring. \u2018She was\u2019 would have sufficed.\n\n> \u201cHe was annoyed that the girl was no more than twelve years old. And had tears in her eyes.\u201d\n\nPolish, like French, uses \u2018to have\u2019 for one\u2019s age, so it\u2019s \u2018\u2026the girl had no more than twelve years. And tears in her eyes.\u2019\n\n> \u201cHe was not allowed to enter the castle; instead they sent him to speak to the mayor in the merchants\u2019 guild.\u201d\n\nNot the mayor, but [someone with very different responsibilities and powers.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starosta)\n\n> \u201c\u2019\u2026No one knows why they keep changing, because anyway every second one is a half-elf or quarter-elf; accursed blood and race. Everything bad is the fault of the elves.\u2019 \n\n> Geralt did not add that it was also the fault of the carters, because the joke, although well-known, did not amuse everybody.\u201d \n\nAdapted from an old anti-anti-Semitic joke. Originally it was about Jews and cyclists, I believe (\u2018Why cyclists?\u2019 \u2018Why Jews?\u2019).\n\n> \u201cWell, but we\u2019re sitting here chin-wagging, and we need to get on, as my late first wife was wont to say.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u2026Chin-wagging, and the vein\u2019s down\u2026\u2019 Yes, that\u2019s a reference to an expired erection.\n\n> \u201cThe brute, so I am informed, ate old Zakorek, who was famous for never being sober, one old bag from up near the castle and several children of the ferryman Sulirad\u201d\n\n\u2018Sulirad\u2019 means \u2018promising joy\u2019 (not in modern Polish, though) and it\u2019s an actual Slavic name, so I\u2019m fine with it remaining untranslated, but \u2018Zakorek\u2019 isn\u2019t, it means \u2018behind-the-cork.\u2019\n\n* Secretary Peregrib is originally Przegrzybek. It\u2019s an interesting attempt at making the name more appealing to an English eye by reverting it to what its simplified Old Slavic form might have been. It also kind of means \u2018ultimate little mushroom.\u2019\n\n> \u201cThere was fuck-all here, I says to that, except green fields, bushes and werewolves\u201d\n\nBushes and werewolves rhyme. Krzaki-wilko\u0142aki.\n\nIV\n\n> \u201cideally one killed by a lightning bolt from a clear sky during a full moon.\u201d\n\nA bolt from a clear sky is a common expression for a sudden shock, like when San Marino score against England 20 seconds in.\n\n> \u201cmany would think again.\u201d\n\nA nice verb single-word meaning \u2018to conclude a consideration of something by deciding not to do it.\u2019 Literally \u2018to dissipate the thought.\u2019\n\n> \u201cPoor thing,\u2019 the Witcher grimaced. \u2018Indeed, it brings a tear to my eye.\u2019 \n\n> \u2018Why the sarcasm? I\u2019m trying to explain why sorcerers aren\u2019t fond of village quacks, charmers, healers, wise women and witchers.\u201d \n\nThe Polish text has \u2018irony.\u2019 In general, while Polish has the word \u2018sarkazm,\u2019 it feels a bit foreign. Also, funnily enough, French uses \u2018wise women\u2019 for a word which, at least in modern usage, is a sexist (or at least gender-specific) term most typically used for the kind of middle-aged or old woman the user of the word can\u2019t wait to get divorced with.\n\n> \u201c\u2018Your perspicacity,\u2019 the sorcerer went on, \u2018will save us a great deal of the time we would have wasted on further fudging.\u201d\n\n\u2018Fudging\u2019 is literally \u2018wrapping in cotton.\u2019 It\u2019s a relatively recent, relatively colloquial expression, and, of course, one would not expect cotton in a quasi-Medieval quasi-European setting. Edit: as u/Nowa_Korbeja pointed out below, the expression goes back at least to the 1800s and cotton was, after all, present in Medieval Europe, so the only point remaining here is that it's colloquial. Thank you!\n\n> \u201cTo vanish from her life, to stop interfering. In short: that you get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nIn an interpretation that would feel too literal to a Polish reader, it can be taken to mean \u2018that you move in with the Devil.\u2019\n\n> \u201cGeralt noticed his knuckles whitening.\u201d\n\nNoticed his knuckles had whitened.\n\n> \u201cThe space above the table suddenly teemed with fabulously coloured Apollo butterflies.\u201d\n\nTheir name doesn\u2019t have the Apollo part in Polish, but it doesn\u2019t matter anyway, Sapkowski once wrote an article on why it\u2019s fine to use Greek mythology references in fantasy literature.\n\n> \u201c By all the demons of the Netherworld, Geralt, you aren\u2019t a child;\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear that this is the intended meaning, it shares the same word with \u2018Down\u2019 (or \u2018Below\u2019) and \u2018Hole.\u2019\n\n> \u201c[\u2018]What you take for emotion is cellular, somatic memory, if you know what those words mean.\u2019 \u2018It so happens I do.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018What you take for emotions is cellular memory, somatic, if you know what that word means.\u2019 \u2018Imagine that I do.\u2019 \u2018Imagine\u2019 is very sarcastic here.\n\n> \u201cIstredd, I cannot even rule out her treatment of you as completely objectionable.\u201d\n\nCompletely instrumental. Geralt and Istredd talk of being instruments and instrumental treatment, rather than objects and\u2026 Did French just think of the wrong adjective with \u2018object\u2019 in it?\n\nV\n\n* Yennefer\u2019s hair is compared to a rook, not a raven.\n\n* When the narrator describes Geralt as looking into the ceiling, he uses a modern word for it, but when Yennefer does it, she uses an archaic term.\n\n* \u2018To go to bed with someone\u2019 has a particular bluntness to it.\n\n\n> \u201cWho? What is truth, Geralt? What is the essence of truth?\u2019\n\nRather graceful, I\u2019d say. Originally \u2018Co jest prawd\u0105, Geralt? Czym jest prawda?\u2019 or \u2018What is truth, Geralt? *What* is truth?\u2019 Huh. The first one asks \u2018what is true?\u2019 while the second one \u2018[the?] truth is what?\u2019 Of course, there\u2019s a lot more to be said about it.\n\nVI\n\n* Geralt comes to Istredd to face him undoubtedly, not undeniably.\n\nVII\n\n> \u201cGeralt did not look at him. He did not look at the mayor as he left the inn, shielded by Cicada from the staggering log drivers and carters. A small man with a ratty face and piercing, black eyes sitting a few tables away was watching him.\u201d\n\nNot sure what happened here. Geralt is watching the man, not the other way around. Later, he throws two gold coins, not just coins, on the table.\n\nVIII\n\n> \u201cand reached above his right shoulder. For his sword. His sword was not there. \u2026 dropping to one knee again, dodging a blow, and reaching into his boot for his dagger. There was no dagger.\u201d\n\nAgain, if Sapkowski wants parallel structure, let him. \u2018For his sword. He had no sword. \u2026 reaching into his boot for the dagger. He had no dagger.\u2019\n\n> \u201c\u2018By Baal-Zebuth,\u2019 Geralt heard somebody pant. \u2018It\u2019s a witcher . . . A real bruiser . . .\u2019 The other swore, breathing heavily. \u2018He didn\u2019t have a sword . . . O Gods, save us from the Evil . . . Let\u2019s scarper, Radgast! Don\u2019t touch him.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe heard somebody pant. Not a bruiser, Sapkowski uses \u2018charakternik,\u2019 an archaic word for a sorcerer. The rest of what is said relies heavily on an onomatopoeia for spitting, which is connected with trying to prevent bad things from happening in superstitions. \u2018He didn\u2019t have a sword\u2026 Gods\u2026 Spit, spit, on [evil charms], on the Evil\u2026 Let\u2019s blow away [highly colloquial], Radgast! Don\u2019t touch him, spit, spit!\u2019\n\n> \u201c\u2018I\u2019m challenging you to fight! Do you hear me, mutant?\u2019 Cicada shouted, barring his way again. \u2018What are you waiting for? Draw your weapon! What, got cold feet? Or perhaps you\u2019re nothing more than one of those other fools who\u2019s humped that witch of yours, like Istredd?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018Do you hear me, [rather offensive term for someone different]?\u2019 \u2018Draw your iron from the shagreen! [before Googling \u2018shagreen\u2019 to make sure, I thought it went \u2018from the lizard (as in lizard leather),\u2019 and that might me many people\u2019s first thought]\u2019 \n\nAnd, most importantly, \u2018Or perhaps you only face those who, like Istress, have screwed that witch of yours?\u2019\n\n> \u201cHe was watching the Witcher\u2019s eyes, not his hands, and that was a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u2018not his hands. That was a mistake.\u2019\n\n> \u201cHe punched Cicada right in the mouth, straight in his twisted lips. They split, exploding like mashed cherries.\u201d\n\n\u2018He hit right in the mouth, straight in the twisted lips. The lips of Cicada split, exploded like mashed cherries.\u2019 The middle of this passage is literally \u2018wykrzywione wargi. Wargi Cykady\u2019 and the repetition of \u2018lips\u2019 right on either side of the period is yet another example of repetition as one of Sapkowski\u2019s favoured devices. Hey, Sapkowskian repetition. I coined it, if anyone asks.\n\n> \u201cAs Geralt passed he casually kicked him in the face, shattering his cheekbone, and sending him splashing into the puddle again.\u201d\n\n\u2018Passing him by, Geralt casually kicked him in the face, shattering his cheekbone, sending him splashing into the puddle again.\u2019 While the first participle might just be too much in English, the \u2018and\u2019 between the other two violate Sapkowski\u2019s style.\n\nIX\n\n> \u201cA black bird with ruffled feathers sat on the sorcerer\u2019s shoulder.  \n\n> It was a kestrel.\u201d \n\n\u2018shoulder. / A kestrel.\u2019\n\n---\n\nETERNAL FLAME\n\nI\n\n> \u201cJars she had received from clients. Yennefer had no idea how to make preserve \u2013 her magic was fallible in that respect.\u201d\n\nMagic was fallible, not Yennefer\u2019s magic.\n\n> \u201c\u2018and get out of my sight! Don\u2019t set foot here again, you bastard!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018You [third-rate player]\u2019\n\n> \u201cI consider this fickle relationship over.\u201d\n\nDandelion uses somewhat poetic sentence order and an obsolete \u2018this\u2019 here, making the sentence stand out.\n\n> \u201cThe air bears autumn\u2019s cool scent \n\n> Our words seized by an icy gust \n\n> Your tears have my heart rent \n\n> But all is gone and part we must.\u201d \n\nAlmost literally \u2018The smell of autumn\u2019s gust has spread [please, improve on it, it\u2019s very poetic in Polish] / The meaning of words has departed with a cold wind / So it must be, nothing can be changed anymore / By the diamonds at the ends of your eyelashes\u2019\n\n> \u201cHe broke off, waving cheerfully at two maids who were passing, carrying baskets of vegetables. The girls giggled.\u201d\n\nAt this point it\u2019s occurred to me that French might be trying to facilitate a transition from Stok\u2019s style, seeing as SoD goes in between two of her translations. Too far-fetched? Anyway, I believe I\u2019ve mentioned the snot-based word for children. Both \u2018maids\u2019 and \u2018girls\u2019 are that word.\n\n> \u201cHere in Novigrad, the capital of the world, the centre and cradle of culture. Here a cultured man can live life to the full.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s live it one lane further on,\u2019 suggested Geralt, glancing at a tramp who had squatted down and was defecating, eyes bulging, in an alleyway.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m singling this out because I feel I\u2019ve been a bit too negative. Originally, it\u2019s \u2018a cultured man can breathe with a full breast,\u2019 the second part of which is a fixed expression, and French handles it very well.\n\n> \u201cAround your house, now white from frost \n\n> Sparkles ice on the pond and marsh \n\n> Your longing eyes grieve what is lost \n\n> But naught can change this parting harsh . . . \n\n\u2018Where you live, it\u2019s now all white from the snow / Small lakes and marshes sparkle with ice / So it must be, nothing can be changed anymore / By the longing hiding in your eyes\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a shame the third line\u2019s near repetition couldn\u2019t be preserved. \n\n> \u201cThou art as exquisite as the morn, and the shape of thy parted lips are enticingly . . .\u2019\n\nThe shape is. I imagine it will have been a prime candidate for being corrected in the second edition.\n\n> \u201cThe troubadour caught the screaming Detchka, carefully choosing the places to seize her by.\n\nCarefully choosing them despite hurrying.\n\n* Everyone uses \u2018he,\u2019 not \u2018it\u2019, when talking of the doppler.\n\n> \u201cYou\u2019re not far off being a man, and that\u2019s a monster.\u201d\n\nFrom being a human.\n\n> \u201chair. \u2018Money, Mr Dainty, has to circulate, and business has to be kept moving.\u2019 \u2018Be careful I don\u2019t wring your neck!\n\n\u2018Keep moving\u2019 and \u2018wring\u2019 are the same verb.\n\n* Dudu has bought 500, not 1000 bushels of cochineal.\n\n> \u201cHe rushed after him, only to run into a resilient but hard wall of men barring his way.\u201d\n\nElastic but hard. It doesn\u2019t make sense, does it?\n\n* French renders \u2018kopper\u2019 as \u2018penny,\u2019 which kind of makes sense. \u2018Kopper\u2019 is, as far as I can tell, a neologism (\u2018copper\u2019 has a native word for it), so its novelty would be lost in English, and \u2018penny\u2019 at least seems suitable for formal contexts.\n\n* The \u2018whoreson\u2019 Dainty mouths is a different if similar word from the one used earlier in the story. \u2018From-a-whore\u2019 rather than \u2018from-a-whore-son.\u2019\n\nII\n\n> \u201cGeralt approached and Chappelle gently extended an arm. If he touches my elbow, I\u2019ll strike him, the Witcher thought. I\u2019ll strike him, whatever happens. Chappelle did not touch Geralt\u2019s elbow.\u201d\n\n\u2018Strike\u2019 seems too formal here, I\u2019d go with \u2018punch.\u2019\n\n> \u201c\u2018it might be possible that the fee for your services would be a guarantee that you and your friends would leave this\u2014 leave the theoretical city alive. What then?\u2019\u201d\n\nChapelle stops himself a word earlier. \u2018would depart from\u2026 From the theoretical city alive.\u2019\n\n* I\u2019m starting to suspect a difference in the Polish editions as well. Muskrat names the price of cochineal as 5.20, not 10.40 a bushel. Combined with the previous disparity, it increases the amount of money involved four times. Considering Dudu's profit, 500 bushels at 5.20 each seems more likely.\n\n* \u2018Levorution\u2019 or \u2018leworucja\u2019 is funnier in Polish because \u2018lewo\u2019 means \u2018left (as opposed to something to the right).\u2019\n\nIII\n\n> \u201cAnd I know your songs, I know them, I\u2019ve heard them. About Princess Vanda, who drowned in the River Duppie, because no one wanted her. And about the kingfisher that fell into a privy\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n[Princess Wanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Wanda) was a legendary ruler of Krak\u00f3w who, in some legends, drowned herself in the Vistula to save her people from a German invasion. I\u2019m surprised by the name of the river, I thought it was \u2018Duppa,\u2019 which, if you remove one \u2018p,\u2019 means \u2018arse.\u2019 \u2018About the kingfisher\u2019 and \u2018into a privy\u2019 rhyme (\u2018o zimorodku-do wychodku\u2019).\n\n* Sapkowski seems to use the Warsaw hundredweight of 160 pounds, significantly heavier than most hundredweights.\n\n> \u201cWhat is happening here? Pour what? Into what?\u2019 \u2018I have no idea,\u2019 Dainty admitted. \u2018But, Vimme, the wheels of business must be oiled.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis might just be where the seeds of \u201cMuch more\u201d were planted. Dainty repeats what Dudu told him, that business has to be kept moving (literally: has to revolve). It\u2019s important for his arc, it\u2019s important from a structural and narrative point of view that his journey is signalled with that repetition, and French ignores it or fails to notice it.\n\nIV\n\n> \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t come any closer,\u2019 the second Witcher said huskily and smiled. \u2018Don\u2019t come any nearer, Geralt. I won\u2019t let you lay hands on me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is quite similar. Dudu echoes Geralt\u2019s thoughts about not letting Chappelle touch him using much more similar words, French fails to observe it.\n\n> \u201cWhat a hideous smile I have, Geralt thought, reaching for his sword. What a hideous face I have. And how hideously I squint.\u201d\n\nPetition to pay for someone to stand by as French translates Sapkowski and cough every time French writes a redundant \u2018and\u2019? All three of Geralt\u2019s thoughts start the same way. \u2018What a hideous smile I have, Geralt thought, reaching for the sword. What a hideous face I have. What a hideous squint I do.\u2019\n\n> \u201cAs a wolf I ran, I howled and I fought without others over a she-wolf.\u201d\n\nThis made my dig up my paperback and see if it also has this error. It does.\n\n> \u201cSpring will return, on the road the rain will fall \n\n> Hearts will be warmed by the heat of the sun \n\n> It must be thus, for fire still smoulders in us all \n\n> An eternal fire, hope for each one.\u201d \n\n\u2018Spring will return, rain will flow down onto the roads / The hearts will warm in the heat of the sun / So it must be, for this fire still smoulders in us / The eternal fire that is hope.\u2019 You can argue that the final line could lose the \u2018the.\u2019\n\n> \u201c\u2018I wouldn\u2019t come any closer,\u2019 Geralt said quietly. \u2018If I were you, Lord Chappelle, sir, I wouldn\u2019t come any closer.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhich reminds me that earlier, Chappelle called Geralt \u2018pan Witcher\u2019 (Part 1 has a detailed discussion of the word, I believe) which French rendered as \u2018dear Witcher,\u2019 here, \u2018pan Chappelle\u2019 becomes \u2018Lord Chappelle.\u2019 In the next line, Chappelle thous Geralt.\n\n> \u201c\u2018Popped his clogs,\u2019 the second Chappelle whispered. \u2018Two months ago now. Apoplexy. May the earth lie lightly on him, and may the Eternal Fire light his way.\u201d\n\n\u2018May the earth lie lightly on him\u2019 is a fixed Polish expression [of Latin origin]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit_tibi_terra_levis). While the Romans would inscribe it on tombs, the Poles stick to saying it when mentioning dead people. \u2018May the Eternal Fire light his way,\u2019 or, literally, \u2018may the Eternal Fire shine on him,\u2019 closely echoes a [Christian prayer for the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Rest) (which Chernobyl fans might be familiar with, but I\u2019m digressing). The echo kind of foreshadows the final part of the Hussite Trilogy, Lux Perpetua or Perpetual Light.\n\nAlso, \u2018popped his clogs\u2019 is a rare literal use of a phrase usually used for saying \u2018damn him,\u2019 but which technically means \u2018to have an apoplexy.\u2019\n\n* The word for vigil lights is [znicz, or grave candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_candle).\n\n---\n\n\nAnd here it is! I meant to include all of SoD in this part, but Reddit's post size limit got in the way, so expect another part later this week, maybe even tomorrow, I've only got most of Something More to go over.\n\nPS. Let me know what's better, detailed nitpicking that'll take years, or broadly pointing out the historical and cultural references that non-Polish speakers might not get, which might be done in a matter of months."

Then, just as Geralt is almost caught up with Ciri, he gets his ass handed to him by Vilgefortz. We get a final scene of Triss dragging a semi-conscious Geralt and begging Tissaia to send them away. Fire raging on the stairs from her fireball, the screams of rabble approaching. Then just Tissaia's \"I will help.\" And a cut to black.\n\n\nI'm getting chills just thinking about it.

Everything you need is probably well described there. Therefore, I will not describe most of the items here, only a few misssing from the post.\n\nSome time ago I decided that if I wanted to come back again to read Sapkowski\u2019s books and play the game trilogy, before the start of The Witcher from Netflix, I could go a step further and acquaint myself with everything that was released under the Witcher brand. Looking through the Reddit in search of a full list of Witcher media, I found myself missing a few noteworthy books developing the lore created by CDPR and a few which are considered non-canonical but were published with the permission of Sapkowski. And this is what this post intends to do; list and describe less known items that are often overlooked, some rightfully, some not so much. So, if you are interested in such, I invite you to read my post.\n\nI divided the items into available in English, Polish only, and miscellaneous - things released under the cdpr license that did not really fit into the main list\n\n## Available in English\n***\n 1.

And I had a thought: do you think she is the reason the king was wounded and left for dead while out on a hunt while she was pregnant with Pavetta? \n\n\n\nBecause, personally, I think it's kind of fucking hilarious in a poetic way for her to arrange his death, and leave him for dead only for Duny to save him and bring him back to the castle to invoke the law of surprise for Panetta's hand in marriage"

        "body": "So I just read the first two books of The Witcher and it was a delight, It was my first time reading a fantasy book and never I could I imagine I would be having a blast. I Immediately watched both the trailers (again) for the upcoming Netflix series and I begun to have questions. It is confirmed that Ciri would be much older in the Netflix series as opposed to the books where she's about 10-11 years old. I'm really curious about how they would handle Ciri in the Netflix series. Freya Allan (Age: 18) seems a decent actress, and I am excited about what she has to offer. I hope her age would not hinder the show. I'm sure they've found a way to handle it. Do you think she'll do a fantastic job on the series, or do you prefer they would have cast a younger actress? Or maybe there's a younger Ciri we have yet to see? Maybe Allan's Ciri is set on a different timeline? Who knows?   \n\n\nAlso, spoilers, after having read the last short story, I understand why the last episode is called \"Much More\". That was Geralt's last line >!after answering to Ciri if she was his destiny. \"You're more than that, Ciri. Much More\". That was a beautiful easter egg over there.!<"

Let\u2019s please keep this dignified without pearl-clutching or getting nasty. \n\nCiri was younger in the books than Freya Allen during filing. Freya was still only 17. In the books, Ciri had older men attempt to rape with her, and she had nearly given in to a man when it was \u201cinterrupted\u201d. \n\nFurthermore, her relationship with Mistle was rather forced at first, and certainly came from her being in a position of weakness, dominated by an older female. \n\nI\u2019ve read some people talk about them toning it down. Maybe they are considering the Sansa Stark rape scene from GOT. I hope they do not. \n\nSapkowski certainly has strong beliefs respecting women, and wrote the horrible events for the same reason that he wrote about good people dying - bad things happen, and it\u2019s what makes a story special. \n\nIn interviews, Freya seems mature beyond her years, and as an actor can separate reality from the part. Conveying the acts does not mean she had to be overly-revealing or turn this into soft-porn. \n\nTuning down the sexual assault aspect would be watering down the story. I hope they did this right, it\u2019s what makes Ciri the most compelling and interesting character in the entire body of work."

I wouldn\u2019t blame her if she never went back to the continent. Although I guess technically from what sorceresses and others said in the books is that it wouldn\u2019t be her changing the world it would be her child. I wonder how the show will handle that. If they will make it so it is her not her child that is to change the world but then that cuts out the \u201cspecial baby\u201d creepy part where everyone was wanting to knock her up. If they do make her the special one instead of her baby I guess everyone could still be after her. I hadn\u2019t thought about it until just now, what do you guys think they will do in the show?!<"

        "body": "I wanted to give my thoughts on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly, in the game, you get to know ciri and yennefer mostly through Geralt as you are after all playing as him.\n\nBut even CD Projekt realized this wouldn't satisfy these characters so sometimes you get to play as Ciri. Personally those were some of my favorite times in the game -- playing as Ciri.\n\nAnd I have no worry that Netflix will do this same justice to each character (Yen, Ciri, Geralt) to bring them all together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, saying it will focus on Ciri and Yennefer is actually a misinterpretation of Lauren Hissrich's words. \n\nShe never said or communicated in any way that the show would prefer them to Geralt which is how many people are taking it. She is saying that the show will bring Ciri and Yennfer and Geralt's backstories in to build each character and bring them together.  With Henry Cavil as Geralt I am confident he will be there as much if not more than you would like him too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, this show is about Geralt, that goes without saying.\n\nBut we all know Geralt wouldn't be Geralt without Ciri and Yen. So it's important that they all have a proper introduction to people that don't know this story like we who have read the books and played the games do. Otherwise people won't see the incredible story and just how Geralt of Rivia truly is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, in all, I wanted this out there because these concerns I think are amiss. The show is going to be great. \n\nHere's a few reasons why\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Lauren Hissrich initially turned down the offer to make this series, but soon fell in love with it after reading the books and playing the games.\n2. Henry Cavil became obsessed with the witcher through the games and fought incredibly hard to bring Geralt of Rivia to life. \n3. The writer of the books, which the games are based off, said that if the series looks anything like it does in the trailer it will be a masterpiece.\n4. The Witcher is not game of thrones or any other fantasy series nor is it trying to be. It is incredibly unique in the histories and folklore it draws from and the story itself is unlike any other story. \n5. The series has taken on some new actors which are all incredibly passionate about the story and their roles and continuing to be part of the series.\n6. The community behind both the witcher books and games are always waiting to put pressure here and there and the creators are aware of this and communicating with people about these wants and needs openly which shows an understanding of the true significance of the books and games."

While he may not be listed with the core trio of leads\u2014Henry Cavill (Geralt), Anya Chalotra (Yennefer), and Freya Allan (Ciri)\u2014you can be sure he'll have a strong presence throughout the series. **Joey Batey** plays the gifted and loyal (to friends, not so much to lovers) bard **Jaskier.** A musician and actor, they couldn't have picked better for the role.\n\nRead on to get a better sense of our Jaskier, and don't forget to check out our [**cast wiki page**](https://old.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/wiki/hub/thecast) for more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n## Past Work\n\nA breakdown of [**Joey Batey's**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147147/) [(showreel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/cte2f4/joey_batey_showreel/) roles and projects before *The Witcher.* \n\n### [The White Queen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372220/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_14) [(Trailer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb49-oV0F78)\n\n* Joey Batey plays **Edward of Lancaster**, the son of Henry VI.

Intriguing and beguiling, have a care for this devil.'\n* Keep an eye out for their second album which, according to [Joey's official Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1G6MBtBNAF/), is in the works \n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Jaskier\n\nJulian Alfred Pankratz, aka Jaskier. A famed bard. A loyal friend. A part-time spy.\n\nThis renowned troubadour has many a vice and his share of questionable opinions. Jaskier's decision-making skills leave something to be desired, too. But for all that, he's never far from The Witcher's side and is a perfect foil for him. And despite his (numerous) faults, he can offer up some magnificent advice too.\n\nJaskier appears in as many short stories as Yennefer and pops up plenty in the novels too. He might be an even more frequent contributor in the show, by the nature of the medium.\n\nJoey's portrayal of the beloved bard has been kept under wraps, but we do know a little.\n\n\n## What short stories has Joey been filming?\n\nA number of the short stories Jaskier appears in will be adapted for the show. We know this from the casting of characters who are in the stories. **The Last Wish** (likely to be episode five) and **The Edge of the World** (likely to be episode two) will both be in the show. **Something More**, in which Jaskier appears more briefly, will also be adapted. The\n\nThere has been **no evidence** that the show will adapt **Eternal Flame** or A **Little Sacrifice**, two short stories Jaskier appears in.\n\nIt's also possible Jaskier will appear in parts of the plot where that was not the case in the books. For example, **in the movie script** which preceded the TV show, Jaskier travelled with Geralt to Blaviken for **The Lesser Evil**.\n\nWe also know Henry Cavill (Geralt) filmed scenes with Joey Batey (Jaskier) at Tata Castle -  [Discussion](https://old.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/bxgb1t/our_favourite_duo_geralt_and_jaskier_have_filmed/) | [Article](https://redanianintelligence.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/the-witcher-filming-scenes-with-a-surprising-character-at-tata-castle/)\n\n### Our Favorite Book Quotes\n\n> \"Do you think we\u2019re savages, Nilfgaardian? Primitive tribes, obeying some sort of shamanic taboo? It\u2019s obvious that only the woman can make a decision like that. It\u2019s her inalienable right.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> \u2018That\u2019s the role of poetry, Ciri. To say what others cannot utter.\u2019   \n\u2018It\u2019s a stupid role. And you\u2019re making everything up!\u2019   \n\u2018That is also the role of poetry.'\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> 'We set off from Brokilon on a deranged mission,' he began slowly. 'Taking a lunatic risk, we launched ourselves on an insane quest for a mirage without the slightest chance of success. A quest for a phantom, a daydream, an absolutely impossible ideal. We set off in pursuit like idiots, like madmen. But I didn't utter a word of complaint, Geralt. I didn't call you a madman. I didn't ridicule you. For you had hope and love in you. You were being guided by them on this reckless mission. I was too, as a matter of fact. But I've caught up with the mirage, and I was lucky enough that the dream came true. My mission is over. I've found what is so difficult to find. And I intend to keep it. Is that insanity? It would be insanity to give it up and let it slip through my fingers.'\n\n---\n\n# Social Media\n\n* The first signs of life came not from Joey but **Imogen Daines' (Danica)** now deleted Instagram. In between filming for *A Question of Price*, the cast got together and posed for a few **cute group photos.** This was the first discovered by the fandom from this outing. Later, Ossian Perret (Lord Tinglant) would release more behind-the-scenes cast photos in celebration of the first teaser dropping.

First up, he introduced the accounts with a **set photo of his and Henry Cavill (Geralt)'s chairs**. A while later, we got a few post-production teases of **Joey hitting the recording booth** for what we assume are Jaskier's bard songs (and likely also ADR). Even **composer Sonya Belousova** teased a bit from her own Instagram, sharing sheet music for Jaskier's bard songs, which **you can hear performed by a professional musician** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/dai8g5/my_father_plays_jaskier_songs_on_the_viola_source/) - [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/brdlcf/cast_update_roundup_new_cast_members_confirmed/) | [Post 1](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxuQ8_HF7ze/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/ca5dq5/looks_like_jaskier_is_recording_some_music/) | [Post 2](https://www.instagram.com/p/BznJ4MilmtQ/) | [Discussion 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/d8t2se/sonya_belousova_on_ig_a_star_is_born_his_name_is/) | [Post 3](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2zrjnuAUgs/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# THE BARD\n\nJoey is not very active on social media, even  though he has a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joeybateyuk) and an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joeybateyofficial/) account. Because of that we will cast a wider net and include posts that feature him.\n\n* After the announcement of Joey Batey landing the role of Jaskier, fans were quick to point out that he is part of the folk band **The Amazing Devil**. Their sound is very bard-like - [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/aote6q/new_video_from_the_amazing_devil_joey_batey/) | [Post

        "body": "I don't understand why people rate Blood of Elves so low (positions 4-8 in another thread). \n\nEverything in this book is successful and interesting - Cintra, Jaskier / Yennefer, great KM, interesting intrigues of kings and wizards, great Yarpen and the whole travel chapter, fight with the monster, super intriguing Oxenfurt with the introduction of Phillippa and Dijkstra, fantastic scenes of Yenn and Ciri, the story goes forward. No other book is so \"equal\" in good quality. Time of Contempt has an average beginning where not much happens for the first 100 pages, the ending is also not extremly great. The baptism of fire phenomenally presents Gerlat's companions but the other threads are barely defined and the action does not go forward. The Tower of Swollow is highly variable. Sometimes there is a weaker thread of \"Geralt's team\" (especially written from a strange perspective of Dandelion's diaries) and at other times one of the threads of Ciri's story is weaker., but of course superb Yennefer chapter. The Lady of the Lake  is full of elements that do not suit everyone, I personally quite like Toussaint, but Nimue ...\n\nTo sum up, the Blood of the Elves is (at least) good in 100%,subsequent books have very uneven levels, a lot of medium, unnecessary scenes or which are ok but without them it would also be good (courier thread in ToC). \n\nI understand the creators why they were considering starting the series with Blood of Elves. Because although there is no \"introduction\" of the characters (because it was at the stage of stories), in this book everything is in place, a coherent unfolding story without inclusions about couriers, times 200 years later and diaries of old Jaskier."

I worry that her apparent flaws being apologized for upfront by her awful childhood will lessen the impact of her character arc throughout the series. \n\nDoes anyone else have similar concerns? In any case, I\u2019m hoping my doubts are proven wrong, and I\u2019ll be blown away by Anya\u2019s performance in a couple weeks."

        "body": "I wanted to give my thoughts on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly, in the game, you get to know ciri and yennefer mostly through Geralt as you are after all playing as him.\n\nBut even CD Projekt realized this wouldn't satisfy these characters so sometimes you get to play as Ciri. Personally those were some of my favorite times in the game -- playing as Ciri.\n\nAnd I have no worry that Netflix will do this same justice to each character (Yen, Ciri, Geralt) to bring them all together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, saying it will focus on Ciri and Yennefer is actually a misinterpretation of Lauren Hissrich's words. \n\nShe never said or communicated in any way that the show would prefer them to Geralt which is how many people are taking it. She is saying that the show will bring Ciri and Yennfer and Geralt's backstories in to build each character and bring them together.  With Henry Cavil as Geralt I am confident he will be there as much if not more than you would like him too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, this show is about Geralt, that goes without saying.\n\nBut we all know Geralt wouldn't be Geralt without Ciri and Yen. So it's important that they all have a proper introduction to people that don't know this story like we who have read the books and played the games do. Otherwise people won't see the incredible story and just how Geralt of Rivia truly is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, in all, I wanted this out there because these concerns I think are amiss. The show is going to be great. \n\nHere's a few reasons why\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Lauren Hissrich initially turned down the offer to make this series, but soon fell in love with it after reading the books and playing the games.\n2. Henry Cavil became obsessed with the witcher through the games and fought incredibly hard to bring Geralt of Rivia to life. \n3. The writer of the books, which the games are based off, said that if the series looks anything like it does in the trailer it will be a masterpiece.\n4. The Witcher is not game of thrones or any other fantasy series nor is it trying to be. It is incredibly unique in the histories and folklore it draws from and the story itself is unlike any other story. \n5. The series has taken on some new actors which are all incredibly passionate about the story and their roles and continuing to be part of the series.\n6. The community behind both the witcher books and games are always waiting to put pressure here and there and the creators are aware of this and communicating with people about these wants and needs openly which shows an understanding of the true significance of the books and games."

If done right I could even come to terms with the fact that they possibly changed the Last Wish episode story (perhaps, lol). \n\nThe entire battle could really be one of the show's defining moments if they stay true to what little we know from the books. Like without any spoilers, all that took place with Fringilla and Yen, with Triss and her traumas... and the most brutal part with Coral >!(that confession of Triss' about Coral being a limbless screaming torso is haunting, to say the least) And Triss from what I recall was burnt so bad no one could even recognize her.!< I seriously hope they stick to all this and make use of these little statements from the books in the show because the entire sequence, if done right could be absolutely epic. It also really sets up some things for the characters in the future and if rumors of Fringilla attending Aretuza (possibly as a Nilfgaardian spy) are true, then it would be even more interesting to see her and Yen on opposing sides, as well as Sabrina. It would also be a great way to set up Vilgefortz's introduction. \n\nI'm just worried about the budget and if they'll go all out when it comes to shooting? After all, the battle was according to the books huge and it'd take countless special effects given that the sorcerers are at the center of the battle. I just really hope they do it justice, if it indeed happens in the finale. Speaking of which, does anyone happen to know where Geralt was at that exact point, when the battle was happening? I really can't remember."

I mean he is a very tormented character who seems to be happy only when he is with his women Yennefer, Triss and Ciri and his friend Dandelion.  I don't know but I always perceived him as a depressed character while I was reading the books for the burden he had to carry or to be a witcher and to be considered a monster by everyone, treated as garbage and discriminated against, but at the same time I believe he is condemned to depression  also because it is one of the few Witchers that feels emotions.  So seeing the people who treat you as if you can never be a person but a killer monster hurts, he also knows that he is doomed to the life of the Witcher or to risk his life for people who do not accept you for what you are  .  So I think the supporting characters are very important to Geralt because it's the only time he's really happy even if he doesn't show it.  and you?  What is your analysis of Geralt's character?"

This is a defense of the description that was given by Lauren about the Nilfgaardian empire and their army since so many people think Lauren was completely off base in her description.\n\nAccording to the wiki, the Nilfgaardian empire began to expand in 1239, with Cintra falling in 1263.\n\n`During the Usurper's reign, he proclaimed a national amnesty, diminished the cult of the Great Sun's rights, and, in 1239, he annexed Ebbing. During this long conflict, Metinna, Nazair, and even Maecht were conquered by the Empire by the mid-1250s.`\n\nThe Wiki says it is 2,000 miles (I\u2019m assuming imperial units) from the Yaruga to the Lower Alba (aka True Nilfgaard).\n\nSo in 24 years they conquered an area equivalent to [the distance between Lisbon and Kiev](https://www.distance.to/Lisbon,PRT/Kiev,UKR)\n\n`Cintra's army showed up in the valley but it was surrounded by overwhelmingly larger army of Nilfgaard, and was almost completely destroyed.`\n\nThe only way they could maintain these types of numbers after 24 years of war is by armies consisting almost entirely of slave warriors. The people actually fighting in the army would have been \u201crag tag\u201d considering the fact they are fighting for an empire who just recently conquered them.\n\n`According to the Dandelion's recounting, the Cintran army fought very bravely even though the chances of victory were slim, from dawn to dusk.`\n\nSo despite having an overwhelmingly smaller army, the Cintran army was able to last a full day suggesting they were a better trained, but smaller fighting force."

The thing is anyone seeing this should have been like \"this looks like sh**\" but I'm guessing noone did. It's the exact same for Nilfgaard's armour - literally someone plucked off the street could have looked at that and told them it was shit.

It's all snowy and then she goes through a mist and it's all green and lush. The dryads ask something in their language and Ciri says she is looking for Dara.\n\nThe trailer shows a lot of Cahir and hints at Ciri's nightmares. It shows Fringilla and she says something about choosing Nilfgaard. Also Geralt and Yennefer fighting side by side during the events of the dragon hunt (by their outfits). Yen with magic, Geralt with a sword. And finally, they showed Jaskier! It's the same scene from the previous trailer, but showing his face this time. He has a small chin beard."

So my theory: maybe Calanthe is just talking about some people, who came to arrange marriage between Ciri and a prince?

Some costumes and locations are really ridiculous. Bollywood Mousesack and the disgusting Nilfgaard. Hindi action movie but with high budget = Netflix's Witcher.\n\nThe creators announced that it would be an adaptation of the books, not the games. However, it looks like a simpler version of The Witcher 3, but without the European Middle Ages and beard.\n\nI am sure that we will not get script at the level of book stories, maybe there will be some good dialogues, like the leak of Yennefer monologue. In any case, the creators do not want to show us such scenes for now, because Americans do not like to think. The marketing campaign has no ambitions and you are delighted. For you, the uniqueness of the Witcher are action scenes and explosions? (sorry for bad english)"

She was cast as a Aretuza novice sorceress? So I was curious about hearing your theories on how this plays out... Lauren also claimed she liked writing for Fringilla alongside Cahir and Istredd. I was thinking she was gonna be more like the show's version of Cynthia from the games... a nilfgaardian sorceress that infiltrates Aretuza as a spy because I really can't think of any other logical way for her to participate there as a student unless they change everything about her. \n\nWhat do you guys think?"

There will certainly be room for improvement but this is only season one. Many people have reasonably claimed that The Witcher won\u2019t last three seasons as many other Netflix originals have, however I actually believe this show is one of the few Netflix shows that could actually get better over time, as long as Netflix keeps putting more and more money into this project, the book material is all there, and Henry, Freya and, Anya all seem quite dedicated to pleasing both book and game fans.\n\nWith that being said I have a few questions I really hope people can answer for me after watching Netflix\u2019s final trailer. Now this post is not to invite negativity on Netflix or the show runner, but to have as Henry Cavill would describe it a passionate discussion on Netflix\u2019s choices.\nFirst thing I found strange was Cahir fighting Vilgefortz and not getting utterly destroyed \n(Cahir shouldn\u2019t be able to take on Vilgefortz in a fight at any point in the series, am I wrong?)\nSecond thing was about Fringilla Vigo, I find it weird that she comes across very evil and scheming and super loyal to Nilfgaard, I always thought it was said that Nilfgaardian sorceresses stayed out of politics and that it was mainly Phillippa that drags them into her lodge and that\u2019s the only thing they are loyal to but I know the lodge isn\u2019t formed for many years later after the coupe on Thanedd. \nLastly where the heck is Pavetta? I have not seen her and that girl in the trailer who released the magical explosion looked to be Ciri to me.\nLet me know what you think!"

We've gathered those questions and her responses here for easy reading, but we totally recommend checking out [the full post for the BTS pictures she shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/dsltka/a_little_bts_love/) and to join in the cookie dough love fest. It's never too late!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE**\n\n\n**Bilbo_Smaug**\n\n>A small question, how do I pronounce your last name?\n\n**l\\_schmidt\\_hissrich**\n\n>That's a great question. It's Hiss-rick, with a hard sound at the end. :)\n\n---\n\n**Theoson**\n\n>Hey Lauren how did you guys figure out what Geralt's voice would sound like? It sounds similar to the video game Geralt except it carries some of Cavill's English accent. Was it hard for him to develop that voice? Regardless, great voice.\n\n**l\\_schmidt\\_hissrich**\n\n>That's all Henry's doing. He developed and perfected it this season.\n\n---\n\n**MagicMushroom62**\n\n>I\u2019d personally love to see some post production BTS, I\u2019m guessing you cut on either Avid (yikes) or Premiere, with DaVinci for coloring.

Your enthusiasm shone through the unusually transparent social media you did early in production, and I was so upset when the casting controversies seemed to make you close the blinds again. So I'm now thrilled that you're back and opening the kimono wider than ever.\n>\n>My suggestion: the general framework Sapkowski created in the short stories of parodying classic fairy tales with twists that make you rethink the original message has almost unlimited episodic potential. It strikes me as a great template for writers to bounce off of. So I hope that future seasons continue to have some stand alone monster of the week episodes devoted to subverting Disney story expectations in an Eastern European way.\n>\n>A second suggestion- I can't wait to hear the music. Would you consider giving us a preview in your next BTS post?\n>\n>The last wish- I assume you've already tried to pressure the Netflix suits to release the episodes weekly. I'm sure their AI is correct that it increases minutes watched in an immediate sense, but it also obviously kills the opportunity to build buzz. Like Cato and Carthage, you should end every phone call with Netflix with the statement, \"Also, simultaneous season publication for marquee dramas is idiotic.\"\n\n**l\\_schmidt\\_hissrich**\n\n>I LOVE any Hissbitch callback!\n\n---\n\n**YummyMango124**\n\n>This is very important: will the unicorn ever make it on screen?

My job starts and ends with the creative, but in between are the new responsibilities of being the leader of a team, a boss, a mentor, a motivator, a cheerleader, the fresh eye, the historian, the hirer and sometimes the firer, the responsible one, the final say.

I have wanted to ask for a while already: What are your thoughts on the short story The Voice of Reason? Any chance of some parts of it being adapted? I especially love the ending, where Geralt fights Tailles, and >!Tailles hits his own face with his own sword.!< it is one of my favorite scenes in the books, it is such a humorous and smart scene and made me laugh while reading it :)\n>\n>And thank you so much once again for doing this, I hoped for a Witcher series for such a long time, and almost can't believe that it is actually happening now!\n\n**l\\_schmidt\\_hissrich**\n\n>We could only smush so much in S1.

Is this true and if so, do you believe this is enough to capture the important elements of world building, character development, side stories, main stories, etc.?\n\n**l\\_schmidt\\_hissrich**\n\n>In another interview, I said I could write the show for 20 years and still not run out of material.

What was the thought process that led to the current version of the Nilfgaardian armor? I thought it would look more imposing and intimidating. Also, was making a Nivellen episode considered?\n\n**l\\_schmidt\\_hissrich**\n\n>The thought process was this: unlike the Cintran army, which consists of highly-trained knights and specialized soldiers under Calanthe's royal lead, the Nilfgaardian army is one of conscription. As they march northward, the army pillages towns and forces villagers into military servitude. They are not an elite fighting force -- yet. There are powerful leaders in the forefront, yes, but the army itself is more rag-tag, borne of necessity, without glamour or means. Their armor reflects that.  \n>  \n>And yes, we considered all of the short stories. As a writers room, we have many and varied favorites, and not all of them could fit into a season.\n\n---\n\n**fruityrain24**\n\n>Looking forward to the show Lauren.

I just want to understand the actual thought process for the armor. From Lauren Hissrich's own brief statements, it just sounds disconnected. \n\nI just want to know who designed the armor to look like this. What the intent was. What they talked about, and I want to know about the conversations where they looked at the art. Said yes. Start building this and let's do it. \n\nI get this is an adaptation. And changes are to be expected. I'm OK with that. But I'm just not fathoming and understanding what happened here. And I feel as the creative head of this show, Lauren Hissrich has failed to spell out her vision for this design. The one explanation I heard is confusing and sounds highly illogical. \n\nIf the idea was \"ragtag army\" \"conscripted soldiers\" from all over the continent forced into the Nilfgaardian service...well this armor doesn't reflect that. This doesn't look like the armor of a ragtag band of mis-located conscripted soldiers who maybe just grabbed whatever armor or hand-me-downs were available. \n\nLike if you were to see Cahir riding into battle in that...he looks like an absolute joke. That's not a person that strikes fear into your heart. Like if you saw that on the battlefield, would your first thought be, \"Oh ****, were dead? What have we done?\" If anything this armor looks like it would only embolden and encourage the enemy. \n\nThe plot has been lost here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/effav02pmgy31.jpg?width=900&auto=webp&s=19d77ee34d159eb25b8e17a511eec6a85f4c79a9"

        "body": "When I read people's thoughts about the fact that the series adds too many threads from the past of the characters, or that were not developed in the books (allegedly) intentionally at the will of the author, I come to the conclusion that people do not catch one thing.\n\nSapkowski did not have the opportunity to publish a book, Polish writers had no chance of publishing a fantasy book, no one believed it when Sapkowski (even when he was already quite known for writing stories) said that he would write a \"fantasy saga\", this was treated as a joke. So Sapkowski wrote a shor stories for the magazine and had absolutely no space to describe something like the war with Nilfgaard or the stories of Ciri or Yennefer because he fought for maximum popularity among fans who loved Geralt first.\n\nEVERYTHING that Netflix \"expanded\" was not really suitable for the material of the stories and it would be heavily detached and shredded. Sapkowski has outlined a certain outline of history in stories but many things could not fit there. Then came the chance to write the whole, coherent saga. But ... the story has already gone far. How was he supposed to write about the war, the escape of Ciri, Yennefer's past when it was a more or less distant past? We saw only flashes of what happened and it could not be otherwise.\n\nTherefore, it makes no sense to say that these additions are unnecessary and everything should be as in the book. On the contrary - showing these events complements what Sapkowski could not describe and matches what we have in the saga. Since Ciri is the central figure in the saga, how can you say that showing her life in Cintra is not important? Conversely, it is very important and the series goes in this direction. Similarly, Yennefer. Let's be honest, describing \"from scratch\" the story of a \"humpbacked\" girl about whom we don't know anything yet would simply be impossible at this time. Sapkowski was not so popular and such a story would not allow him to break through with the publication of the book. But this story fits perfectly into the world we already know."

To me, it would seem weird to be introduced to other important members of the Chapter like Francesca Findabair or Artaud Terranova next season if they were absent during the mage planning sessions for Sodden? I mean obviously I don't know for sure how the show is adapting Sodden but surely the upper ruling group of the Brotherhood would all be involved in planning the mages' role in any kind of battle?

But don\u2019t you guys wonder about the endings of each season? Take season 2, for example, that will probably cover Blood of Elves. Compared to season 1, which has loads of battles and Geralt and Ciri\u2019s reuinion, Blood of Elves doesn\u2019t really have much finale material. \n\nAnd will season 3 cover Time of Contempt up to the Thanedd Coup only? The rest of the seasons after that, even if they take the ends of each of the books with their respective endings, (e.g the Battle of the Bridge, Ciri ice skating, the end of the whole series) we still only have 6 seasons. Where do you think they\u2019ll slot in another season and what do you think will be the ending of that?"

No other book is so \"equal\" in good quality. Time of Contempt has an average beginning where not much happens for the first 100 pages, the ending is also not extremly great. The baptism of fire phenomenally presents Gerlat's companions but the other threads are barely defined and the action does not go forward. The Tower of Swollow is highly variable. Sometimes there is a weaker thread of \"Geralt's team\" (especially written from a strange perspective of Dandelion's diaries) and at other times one of the threads of Ciri's story is weaker., but of course superb Yennefer chapter. The Lady of the Lake  is full of elements that do not suit everyone, I personally quite like Toussaint, but Nimue ...\n\nTo sum up, the Blood of the Elves is (at least) good in 100%,subsequent books have very uneven levels, a lot of medium, unnecessary scenes or which are ok but without them it would also be good (courier thread in ToC). \n\nI understand the creators why they were considering starting the series with Blood of Elves. Because although there is no \"introduction\" of the characters (because it was at the stage of stories), in this book everything is in place, a coherent unfolding story without inclusions about couriers, times 200 years later and diaries of old Jaskier."

        "body": "**The Witcher #3:** ***Blood of Elves*** **by Andrzej Sapkowski**\n\nThe Northern Kingdoms are flush from their great victory at Sodden Hill, when they defeated the Empire of Nilfgaard after it had conquered the nation of Cintra. The allied rulers now scheme to liberate Cintra, and to this end attention has fallen on the missing princess of that nation, Ciri. Agents scour the land for Ciri, for purposes noble and nefarious, unaware that she is in safekeeping in the great witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen, where Geralt the White Wolf attends to her training. The arrival of an old friend, Triss Merigold, spurs Geralt into taking Ciri to another place of safety, but brings him face to face with those searching for her.\n\nBlood of Elves is the third book in the Witcher series (following on from The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny) but also the first full-length novel, the first of five which collectively tell the story of Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer and the destiny of the Northern Kingdoms.\n\nFor those used to Sapkowski's tight and economical writing in the two story collections, Blood of Elves is something of a surprise. The novel sprawls almost indulgently, with much of the book being taken up by conversations, a lot of which consist of rather unsubtle exposition about the state of the world and politics. This stuff is interesting but overdone. The storyline itself should have a lot more tension, as Geralt takes Ciri from one potential refuge to another, staying ahead of pursuit, but the lengthy infodumping tends to dissipate the effect.\n\nThe book does come alive in its latter part, as Geralt does some traditional Witcher stuff (fighting off a sea monster, getting embroiled in intrigue with Dandilion and some sorcerers, fighting off assassins on the streets of Oxenfurt), and it's fun to meet a bunch of important new characters, such as Triss, Vesemir, Dijkstra,  and Lambert. Players of the Witcher video games will particularly find a lot of things to enjoy here, as The Witcher 3 in particular has a lot of callbacks and nods towards this book.\n\nThe book's key weakness is that not a huge amount happens: it's mostly set-up. Well-written, enjoyable set-up, but nevertheless an extended prologue for a much longer narrative. It does feel like it might have been better to combine this book with the following one, Time of Contempt, to create a more complete narrative. As it stands, Blood of Elves whets the appetite but cannot satisfy it on its own.\n\nBlood of Elves (\\*\\*\\*\u00bd) is a solid instalment of the Witcher series, but is not as tight and varied as the two story collections. It does leave the reader keen to read on, but it feels a bit too slight in itself."

I just finished a reread of the Witcher which is currently my #1 so a lot of my suggestions will be off of what I liked/disliked about it:\n\n-Grittier/darker vibe that shows the realities of war, betrayal, etc to characters and normal civilian - only current example I can think of is how the Witcher series doesn\u2019t hide the realities of war on local people, unarmed citizens, one off characters\n\n-definitely needs magic, but not \u201cover the top unrealistic\u201d within it\u2019s realm. I think the Witcher handled it well again regarding geralt\u2019s ailities/sorceresses- basically I don\u2019t want a comic book-esque normal protagonist who suddenly at the end goes head to head with the god of the universe or something crazy that breaks immersion. There\u2019s magic but there\u2019s still regular guys in the infantry fighting the wars.\n\n-structured story but less of an adventure. Sort of how ASOIF goes everywhere vs. LOTR being an adventure. More of Geralt &gt;!being stuck between wars and less of him forming a ragtag band to find ciri !&lt;\n\n-well built fantasy world \n\n-protagonist(s) not being some type of destined or chosen ruler. ( I hate good hero vs evil thing) Again using the Witcher, geralt is just a Witcher who gets embroiled in the different factions, wars, child of destiny etc but he\u2019s a mortal flawed character instead of some sort of savior. Same with the sorceresses, Elves, in the books. But I don\u2019t care for the solemn lonewolf archetype he portrays.\n-I don\u2019t really want it to just follow one person the whole series, but I also don\u2019t want each book to completely change casts\n- also going off that want well written female protagonist(s) ala Ciri, Yen, people like renfri if she had a full novel\n\nMy dislikes with the Witcher were ciris latter storylines (SPOILERS):  &gt;!When she teleports time various universes etc!&lt; again breaking immersion. \n\nPros for Witcher were well written different warring factions with no good or evil, strong female leads, still comedic relief in the face of this, as well as the character development, simple origins, and mortality. \n\nI\u2019m currently reading Sanderson\u2019s Skyward - and I really like Spensa but it\u2019s a little too YA. I read his novels basically sort of gloss over my first points as well as things like sex. This is why I\u2019m sort of hesitant to start his other works. \n\nI\u2019ve read good things about malazan but I\u2019m worried it\u2019s almost too epic with what\u2019s going on and skips over the finer details of commonfolk like LOTR or ASOIF \n\nSorry if this is spit out in terrible format I\u2019m mobile trying to get all my thoughts out while browsing audible!"

        "body": "The Northern Kingdoms continue to skirmish with the armies of Nilfgaard along the Yaruga. Rumours have reached Geralt, the witcher, that his ward Ciri has been kidnapped by the Emperor of Nilfgaard, who plans to marry her against her will. Geralt, reluctantly, joins forces with a band of heroes and companions to rescue her.\n\nBaptism of Fire is the third novel (and fifth book) in The Witcher saga by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, following on from Blood of Elves and Time of Contempt. The previous books established the basic plot: the Empire of Nilfgaard is warring with the Northern Kingdoms and absolutely everyone wants to get their hands on Ciri, the princess of fallen Cintra. For some, Ciri is a political prize, through whom one can claim the vacant throne of that kingdom. Others are more interested in her formidable magical skills. For her former mentors, the witcher Geralt and sorceress Yennefer, they just want to protect her from those who would abuse her for their own ends.\n\nThe Witcher books have always been a bit oddly structured - starting with two short story collections before segueing into novels which have felt more like parts of books and not whole ones - and Baptism of Fire continues that trend. From the plot synopsis, you might be expecting a grand adventure in which Geralt traverses half the Continent to rescue Ciri. That doesn't even remotely come close to happening. Instead, Geralt doesn't seem to get more than fifty miles from where he started off, accumulating a bunch of companions along the way. The book then becomes much more interested in exploring these characters and their various personality quirks then in moving the main plot forwards. We do get brief cutaways to Yennefer, Ciri and the political machinations between the kingdoms and the wizards, but mostly the action focuses on Team Geralt.\n\nThis has the makings of an entertaining storyline. Geralt's companions include the redoubtable bard Dandelion (aka Jaskier), the nobleman Regis who is more than he seems, the dwarven mercenary Zoltan Chivay, Nilfgaardian turncoat Cahir and the skilled archer Milva. Their adventures include helping refugees, trying to feed themselves and dealing with superstitious peasants eager to burn strangers as suspected vampires. The characterisation of the party is fun and Sapkowski writes some witty banter between the group.\n\nAfter a while, though, it becomes clear this story isn't really going anywhere fast. Our cutaways to Yennefer and the newly-founded Lodge of Sorceresses, or to various political groups scattered around the Continent, mostly give Sapkowski an excuse to drop huge info-dumps on the political situation. For an author who wrote such skilled, focused short fiction in the first two books in the series, Sapkowski is much less assured at novel-length narratives and becomes embodiment of \"tell, don't show.\" Sapkowski does make some cutting points about the morality of war and how innocents pay the price for the decisions of kings and so on, but by this point these are fairly stock tropes.\n\nAs a serialised chunk of a longer narrative, Baptism of Fire (\\*\\*\\*) is fine. As a novel in its own right, the book doesn't really work, with inconsistent pacing and a reluctance to push forward the main storyline with any urgency or tension. Very solid characterisation and some fun dialogue do keep things ticking over though."

        "body": "A new war is threatening to erupt between the Northern Kingdoms and the Empire of Nilfgaard. Sorcerers are gathering on the island of Thanedd to decide on their position. A young woman guarding a power she cannot control is in the care of a sorceress, whilst the Witcher, Geralt, is fighting off threats to her life. These are perilous times for the Continent.\n\nTime of Contempt is the fourth book (and second full-length novel) in the Witcher series by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. Following directly on from the events of Blood of Elves, the novel follows several storylines in close parallel. Numerous factions are still trying to capture or kill Ciri, the princess and only heir of fallen Cintra. Ciri is in the protection of the sorceress Yennefer, who is also trying to navigate the perils of both international and sorcerous politics. The situation also draws in Geralt, who has been trying to protect Ciri from afar, and puts all three of our protagonists in jeopardy when all-out chaos erupts.\n\nTime of Contempt is an improvement over Blood of Elves, which felt like a very long prologue for the rest of the story. That story really gets underway in Time of Contempt, which mixes character development (particularly Ciri becoming less impetuous), international politics, war and action. If Blood of Elves didn't feel complete as a novel, Time of Contempt is more successful in that area, with a distinct battery of storylines and subplots which further the overall narrative.\n\nThere are some issues. In order for the chaos at Thanedd to really land, the reader should already be familiar with many of the wizards involved from their (oft-brief) appearances in the opening two short stories collections, The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. In fact, several more events during the story only really landed with the appropriate emotional weight because I was familiar with the characters from their chronologically later appearances in The Witcher 3 video game. In the absence of that familiarity, I think the events of this storyline might be much less effective.\n\nOnce the book straightens itself out it does get more compelling, and the concluding section which is effectively a solo adventure for Ciri as she crosses a desert and finds a new band of companions feels like the opening of a bold new storyline for her, one that is cut short by the novel not so much concluding in a thematic or dramatically appropriate way, but just ending as if Sapkowski was working to a strict page count deadline. The storyline continues fairly directly into Baptism of Fire.\n\nTime of Contempt (\\*\\*\\*\\*) is an improvement over the previous Witcher novel and features some very good plot and character development. If it has a weakness, it's that it feels a bit too short and in fact I think the series may have benefited from being released as four fat omnibuses rather than eight shorter novels. Nevertheless, it is another solid installment in the series."

I\u2019m coming back to it with a fresh perspective and loving the characters and the overall story a lot more. I\u2019m on page 249, and I\u2019m still just confused. I know there\u2019s a war, and the council of mages (can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called) was split in half by the betrayal of Vilgefortz and the mages he\u2019s aligned with. I know there\u2019s a lot of unrest to the point of battle and murder within the council. I also know Ciri has somehow landed in Emhyrs hands, and that the other Elves aren\u2019t taking it very positively. Geralt ran away after the battle, and Dandelion found him in Brokilon. But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m missing so many pierces to this story. Why did Tissaia de Vries kill herself, and why did Vilgefortz betray everyone? Because he sees the advantages of joining nilfgaard? How did Ciri end up in Nilfgaard, and why did Geralt just leave to Brokilon? Who the hell are 90% of the people mentioned and how are they important to this story? I can\u2019t keep most of their names in my head. Just generally, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH YENEFFER, TRISS, AND THAT OTHER WIZARD WOMAN WHO STOPPED GERALT FROM KILLING RIENCE?! These questions are just off the top of my head, and I\u2019m really struggling with figuring out if I should know the answers or if they will come when Sapkowski wants them to. By the point of Tissaias death, I was already just really annoyed with how In the dark I felt and how confusing and non-linear this story is. I\u2019ve had to sit there for minutes just getting everything straight, and by that point I was tired and burned out so I put down the book. Like I said, I\u2019ve just picked it back up and I\u2019m enjoying it, but I could enjoy it a lot more of I could rest easy knowing these unanswered questions are deliberate. Please don\u2019t spoil the ending, thank you!!!\n\nEdit: The question about Ciri has been answered, and I kind of suspected the answer. Everything else still stands."

        "body": "[***Sword of Destiny*** **by Andrzej Sapkowski**](https://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2019/10/sword-of-destiny-by-andrzej-sapkowski.html)\n\nGeralt, the witcher, continues his journey through the Northern Kingdoms. He kills dangerous monsters for coin but also finds his path entwining with that of the mighty, of powerful sorceresses, generals and kings. But his journey is also a circle, leading him back to a promise he exacted six years ago from the Queen of Cintra and a price he demanded, but is no longer sure he wants paid.\n\n*Sword of Destiny*\u00a0is the second book in the **Witcher**\u00a0series, following on from *The Last Wish*. Like that book, this is a collection of short stories and novellas linked by Geralt and several other recurring characters, such as the bard Dandelion and the sorceress Yennefer, and also by a thematic element: the growth of Geralt as a character and the realisation that he has a destiny he is unsure he wants fulfilled but may not have any control over.\n\nSeveral of the stories are concerned with Geralt's relationship with Yennefer, and the fact they love one another but also cannot be together, and how they both handle the issue. \"A Shard of Ice\" at first appears to be an amusing love triangle story, with Geralt and a sorcerer squaring off over Yennefer's favour, but it soon becomes powerfully bittersweet and even a little tragic. The opening story, \"The Bounds of Reason,\" feels more like a traditional Geralt romp with the witcher called in to help neutralise the threat of a dragon, only to find matters complicated by politics.\n\n\"Eternal Flame\" may be the most fun story in the collection and sees Geralt visit the great city of Novigrad and have to deal with a doppelganger. A smart and funny story, this is the one that arguably feels the closest to the video games, particularly *The Witcher 3*, which has a quest which is a direct sequel to this story. \"A Little Sacrifice\" is a story about mermaids and thwarted romance which takes an interesting turn towards the Lovecraftian and becomes one of the more foreboding stories in the series. \"The Sword of Destiny\" takes the witcher into Brokilon Forest and a confrontation with his destiny, the child Ciri who will become so important in the remaining books.\n\nArguably the highlight of the collection is the concluding story, \"Something More,\" a disjointed story which unfolds in different time periods as Geralt recovers from a serious wound. The story jumps back and forth in time, revisits numerous characters, hints at Geralt's parents and history, and introduces the threat of the Empire of Nilfgaard and its first invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. A surprisingly lyrical and effective mood piece, this may be the best narrative Sapkowski has written to date, remarkable for its effectiveness despite its brevity.\n\nThe result is an extremely strong collection which develops the characters and world in tandem. There aren't many negatives, except that Sapkowski hails from the \"make it up as you go along\" school of worldbuilding, so the failure by anyone to mention the Nilfgaardians or their devastating war before the final story feels a bit odd. There are also issues with the translation: David French feels a lot stronger a translator than Danusia Stok (who translated the first and third books in the series), but there's occasional awkward phrasing, such as the use of the word \"jacket\" rather than a more era-appropriate alternative (\"gambeson\" seems to be a better choice), although this may also be seen as reflecting Sapkowski's preference for modern terms and language.\n\nThis is more than answered by the book's successful exploration of the overall themes of war, loss, romance and hope.\u00a0*Sword of Destiny*\u00a0(\\*\\*\\*\\*\u00bd) is a surprisingly melancholy and thoughtful work which is a very rewarding read, and represents a big improvement over *The Last Wish*."

Geralt is an entertaining protagonist, being taciturn, cynical and world-weary but also has a wry sense of humour, an enjoyment of good ale and a well-hidden yearning for romance.\n\nThe stories themselves vary in tone but the quality is pretty consistent. There's an undercurrent of whimsical humour in the stories that is very reminiscent of Jack Vance. Like Vance, Sapkowski successfully creates a world where his characters feel totally at home. This world is a mix of the traditional **Dungeon & Dragons** landscape of elves, dwarves and evil wizards, and of darker fairy tales. In this manner the stories' tone and atmosphere is very similar to that of Vance's superb **Lyonesse Trilogy**, although Sapkowski is not as continuously and unrelentingly funny as Vance; he also lacks Vance's gift for intricate wordplay. That said, when the book is funny it's very funny indeed. The comic highlight comes when Geralt and his sometimes travelling troubadour companion Dandillion are confronted by some kind of bizarre goat-man entity whose preferred method of combat is to pelt attackers with iron balls. Under strict instructions not to kill anything in the area, Geralt has to engage the goat-man in a particularly preposterous wrestling match. Sapkowski also employs Vance's melancholy aspect, such as Geralt's musings on a world where the fantastical is dying and the mundane is taking over.\n\nThe translation appears to be adequate, although Polish commentators seem more dubious, and the general feeling is that David French (who translated the later books) does a better job than Danusia Stok (who translates *The Last Wish* and *Blood of Elves*, the first and third books in the series). There's occasional awkward moments (the noble Hereward's rank changes from Prince to Duke at random; sometimes words are repeated very close together) but the stories come through feeling very fresh and energetic. Sapkowski is very good at creating interesting, imaginative characters with unusual levels of depth to them, not least Geralt, whom people are consistently underestimating. Early stories feel slightly repetitive, with Geralt unleashing bloody mayhem to win the day, but in the second half of the book there is a shift in tone with Geralt employing more imaginative methods to overcome the obstacles in his path. There is a great deal left unsaid in the stories in the book: we see the start of Geralt's relationship with the sorceress Yennefer but not its later development, and have to put together what happened with the help of Geralt's thought processes in the framing story. This helps make the book more immersive and less reliant on exposition.\n\n**The Witcher** series also consists of a trilogy of well-regarded and very high-selling video games. Players of the games will appreciate the background to the characters provided here (although Sapkowski does not consider the games to be canon).\n\n*The Last Wish* (\\*\\*\\*\\*) is an enjoyable book full of stories both melancholy and comic, establishing a world and cast of characters that is very intriguing. The novel is available now in the UK and USA. A Netflix TV series based on the books is expected to debut in November 2019."

        "body": "[***Sword of Destiny*** **by Andrzej Sapkowski**](https://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2019/10/sword-of-destiny-by-andrzej-sapkowski.html)\n\nGeralt, the witcher, continues his journey through the Northern Kingdoms. He kills dangerous monsters for coin but also finds his path entwining with that of the mighty, of powerful sorceresses, generals and kings. But his journey is also a circle, leading him back to a promise he exacted six years ago from the Queen of Cintra and a price he demanded, but is no longer sure he wants paid.\n\n*Sword of Destiny*\u00a0is the second book in the **Witcher**\u00a0series, following on from *The Last Wish*. Like that book, this is a collection of short stories and novellas linked by Geralt and several other recurring characters, such as the bard Dandelion and the sorceress Yennefer, and also by a thematic element: the growth of Geralt as a character and the realisation that he has a destiny he is unsure he wants fulfilled but may not have any control over.\n\nSeveral of the stories are concerned with Geralt's relationship with Yennefer, and the fact they love one another but also cannot be together, and how they both handle the issue. \"A Shard of Ice\" at first appears to be an amusing love triangle story, with Geralt and a sorcerer squaring off over Yennefer's favour, but it soon becomes powerfully bittersweet and even a little tragic. The opening story, \"The Bounds of Reason,\" feels more like a traditional Geralt romp with the witcher called in to help neutralise the threat of a dragon, only to find matters complicated by politics.\n\n\"Eternal Flame\" may be the most fun story in the collection and sees Geralt visit the great city of Novigrad and have to deal with a doppelganger. A smart and funny story, this is the one that arguably feels the closest to the video games, particularly *The Witcher 3*, which has a quest which is a direct sequel to this story. \"A Little Sacrifice\" is a story about mermaids and thwarted romance which takes an interesting turn towards the Lovecraftian and becomes one of the more foreboding stories in the series. \"The Sword of Destiny\" takes the witcher into Brokilon Forest and a confrontation with his destiny, the child Ciri who will become so important in the remaining books.\n\nArguably the highlight of the collection is the concluding story, \"Something More,\" a disjointed story which unfolds in different time periods as Geralt recovers from a serious wound. The story jumps back and forth in time, revisits numerous characters, hints at Geralt's parents and history, and introduces the threat of the Empire of Nilfgaard and its first invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. A surprisingly lyrical and effective mood piece, this may be the best narrative Sapkowski has written to date, remarkable for its effectiveness despite its brevity.\n\nThe result is an extremely strong collection which develops the characters and world in tandem. There aren't many negatives, except that Sapkowski hails from the \"make it up as you go along\" school of worldbuilding, so the failure by anyone to mention the Nilfgaardians or their devastating war before the final story feels a bit odd. There are also issues with the translation: David French feels a lot stronger a translator than Danusia Stok (who translated the first and third books in the series), but there's occasional awkward phrasing, such as the use of the word \"jacket\" rather than a more era-appropriate alternative (\"gambeson\" seems to be a better choice), although this may also be seen as reflecting Sapkowski's preference for modern terms and language.\n\nThis is more than answered by the book's successful exploration of the overall themes of war, loss, romance and hope.\u00a0*Sword of Destiny*\u00a0(\\*\\*\\*\\*\u00bd) is a surprisingly melancholy and thoughtful work which is a very rewarding read, and represents a big improvement over *The Last Wish*."

        "body": "The Northern Kingdoms continue to skirmish with the armies of Nilfgaard along the Yaruga. Rumours have reached Geralt, the witcher, that his ward Ciri has been kidnapped by the Emperor of Nilfgaard, who plans to marry her against her will. Geralt, reluctantly, joins forces with a band of heroes and companions to rescue her.\n\nBaptism of Fire is the third novel (and fifth book) in The Witcher saga by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, following on from Blood of Elves and Time of Contempt. The previous books established the basic plot: the Empire of Nilfgaard is warring with the Northern Kingdoms and absolutely everyone wants to get their hands on Ciri, the princess of fallen Cintra. For some, Ciri is a political prize, through whom one can claim the vacant throne of that kingdom. Others are more interested in her formidable magical skills. For her former mentors, the witcher Geralt and sorceress Yennefer, they just want to protect her from those who would abuse her for their own ends.\n\nThe Witcher books have always been a bit oddly structured - starting with two short story collections before segueing into novels which have felt more like parts of books and not whole ones - and Baptism of Fire continues that trend. From the plot synopsis, you might be expecting a grand adventure in which Geralt traverses half the Continent to rescue Ciri. That doesn't even remotely come close to happening. Instead, Geralt doesn't seem to get more than fifty miles from where he started off, accumulating a bunch of companions along the way. The book then becomes much more interested in exploring these characters and their various personality quirks then in moving the main plot forwards. We do get brief cutaways to Yennefer, Ciri and the political machinations between the kingdoms and the wizards, but mostly the action focuses on Team Geralt.\n\nThis has the makings of an entertaining storyline. Geralt's companions include the redoubtable bard Dandelion (aka Jaskier), the nobleman Regis who is more than he seems, the dwarven mercenary Zoltan Chivay, Nilfgaardian turncoat Cahir and the skilled archer Milva. Their adventures include helping refugees, trying to feed themselves and dealing with superstitious peasants eager to burn strangers as suspected vampires. The characterisation of the party is fun and Sapkowski writes some witty banter between the group.\n\nAfter a while, though, it becomes clear this story isn't really going anywhere fast. Our cutaways to Yennefer and the newly-founded Lodge of Sorceresses, or to various political groups scattered around the Continent, mostly give Sapkowski an excuse to drop huge info-dumps on the political situation. For an author who wrote such skilled, focused short fiction in the first two books in the series, Sapkowski is much less assured at novel-length narratives and becomes embodiment of \"tell, don't show.\" Sapkowski does make some cutting points about the morality of war and how innocents pay the price for the decisions of kings and so on, but by this point these are fairly stock tropes.\n\nAs a serialised chunk of a longer narrative, Baptism of Fire (\\*\\*\\*) is fine. As a novel in its own right, the book doesn't really work, with inconsistent pacing and a reluctance to push forward the main storyline with any urgency or tension. Very solid characterisation and some fun dialogue do keep things ticking over though."

The allied rulers now scheme to liberate Cintra, and to this end attention has fallen on the missing princess of that nation, Ciri. Agents scour the land for Ciri, for purposes noble and nefarious, unaware that she is in safekeeping in the great witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen, where Geralt the White Wolf attends to her training. The arrival of an old friend, Triss Merigold, spurs Geralt into taking Ciri to another place of safety, but brings him face to face with those searching for her.\n\nBlood of Elves is the third book in the Witcher series (following on from The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny) but also the first full-length novel, the first of five which collectively tell the story of Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer and the destiny of the Northern Kingdoms.\n\nFor those used to Sapkowski's tight and economical writing in the two story collections, Blood of Elves is something of a surprise. The novel sprawls almost indulgently, with much of the book being taken up by conversations, a lot of which consist of rather unsubtle exposition about the state of the world and politics. This stuff is interesting but overdone. The storyline itself should have a lot more tension, as Geralt takes Ciri from one potential refuge to another, staying ahead of pursuit, but the lengthy infodumping tends to dissipate the effect.\n\nThe book does come alive in its latter part, as Geralt does some traditional Witcher stuff (fighting off a sea monster, getting embroiled in intrigue with Dandilion and some sorcerers, fighting off assassins on the streets of Oxenfurt), and it's fun to meet a bunch of important new characters, such as Triss, Vesemir, Dijkstra,  and Lambert. Players of the Witcher video games will particularly find a lot of things to enjoy here, as The Witcher 3 in particular has a lot of callbacks and nods towards this book.\n\nThe book's key weakness is that not a huge amount happens: it's mostly set-up. Well-written, enjoyable set-up, but nevertheless an extended prologue for a much longer narrative. It does feel like it might have been better to combine this book with the following one, Time of Contempt, to create a more complete narrative. As it stands, Blood of Elves whets the appetite but cannot satisfy it on its own.\n\nBlood of Elves (\\*\\*\\*\u00bd) is a solid instalment of the Witcher series, but is not as tight and varied as the two story collections. It does leave the reader keen to read on, but it feels a bit too slight in itself."

I just finished a reread of the Witcher which is currently my #1 so a lot of my suggestions will be off of what I liked/disliked about it:\n\n-Grittier/darker vibe that shows the realities of war, betrayal, etc to characters and normal civilian - only current example I can think of is how the Witcher series doesn\u2019t hide the realities of war on local people, unarmed citizens, one off characters\n\n-definitely needs magic, but not \u201cover the top unrealistic\u201d within it\u2019s realm. I think the Witcher handled it well again regarding geralt\u2019s ailities/sorceresses- basically I don\u2019t want a comic book-esque normal protagonist who suddenly at the end goes head to head with the god of the universe or something crazy that breaks immersion. There\u2019s magic but there\u2019s still regular guys in the infantry fighting the wars.\n\n-structured story but less of an adventure. Sort of how ASOIF goes everywhere vs. LOTR being an adventure. More of Geralt &gt;!being stuck between wars and less of him forming a ragtag band to find ciri !&lt;\n\n-well built fantasy world \n\n-protagonist(s) not being some type of destined or chosen ruler. ( I hate good hero vs evil thing) Again using the Witcher, geralt is just a Witcher who gets embroiled in the different factions, wars, child of destiny etc but he\u2019s a mortal flawed character instead of some sort of savior. Same with the sorceresses, Elves, in the books. But I don\u2019t care for the solemn lonewolf archetype he portrays.\n-I don\u2019t really want it to just follow one person the whole series, but I also don\u2019t want each book to completely change casts\n- also going off that want well written female protagonist(s) ala Ciri, Yen, people like renfri if she had a full novel\n\nMy dislikes with the Witcher were ciris latter storylines (SPOILERS):  &gt;!When she teleports time various universes etc!&lt; again breaking immersion. \n\nPros for Witcher were well written different warring factions with no good or evil, strong female leads, still comedic relief in the face of this, as well as the character development, simple origins, and mortality. \n\nI\u2019m currently reading Sanderson\u2019s Skyward - and I really like Spensa but it\u2019s a little too YA. I read his novels basically sort of gloss over my first points as well as things like sex. This is why I\u2019m sort of hesitant to start his other works. \n\nI\u2019ve read good things about malazan but I\u2019m worried it\u2019s almost too epic with what\u2019s going on and skips over the finer details of commonfolk like LOTR or ASOIF \n\nSorry if this is spit out in terrible format I\u2019m mobile trying to get all my thoughts out while browsing audible!"

But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m missing so many pierces to this story. Why did Tissaia de Vries kill herself, and why did Vilgefortz betray everyone? Because he sees the advantages of joining nilfgaard? How did Ciri end up in Nilfgaard, and why did Geralt just leave to Brokilon? Who the hell are 90% of the people mentioned and how are they important to this story? I can\u2019t keep most of their names in my head.

These questions are just off the top of my head, and I\u2019m really struggling with figuring out if I should know the answers or if they will come when Sapkowski wants them to. By the point of Tissaias death, I was already just really annoyed with how In the dark I felt and how confusing and non-linear this story is. I\u2019ve had to sit there for minutes just getting everything straight, and by that point I was tired and burned out so I put down the book. Like I said, I\u2019ve just picked it back up and I\u2019m enjoying it, but I could enjoy it a lot more of I could rest easy knowing these unanswered questions are deliberate.

        "body": "[***Sword of Destiny*** **by Andrzej Sapkowski**](https://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2019/10/sword-of-destiny-by-andrzej-sapkowski.html)\n\nGeralt, the witcher, continues his journey through the Northern Kingdoms. He kills dangerous monsters for coin but also finds his path entwining with that of the mighty, of powerful sorceresses, generals and kings. But his journey is also a circle, leading him back to a promise he exacted six years ago from the Queen of Cintra and a price he demanded, but is no longer sure he wants paid.\n\n*Sword of Destiny*\u00a0is the second book in the **Witcher**\u00a0series, following on from *The Last Wish*. Like that book, this is a collection of short stories and novellas linked by Geralt and several other recurring characters, such as the bard Dandelion and the sorceress Yennefer, and also by a thematic element: the growth of Geralt as a character and the realisation that he has a destiny he is unsure he wants fulfilled but may not have any control over.\n\nSeveral of the stories are concerned with Geralt's relationship with Yennefer, and the fact they love one another but also cannot be together, and how they both handle the issue. \"A Shard of Ice\" at first appears to be an amusing love triangle story, with Geralt and a sorcerer squaring off over Yennefer's favour, but it soon becomes powerfully bittersweet and even a little tragic. The opening story, \"The Bounds of Reason,\" feels more like a traditional Geralt romp with the witcher called in to help neutralise the threat of a dragon, only to find matters complicated by politics.\n\n\"Eternal Flame\" may be the most fun story in the collection and sees Geralt visit the great city of Novigrad and have to deal with a doppelganger. A smart and funny story, this is the one that arguably feels the closest to the video games, particularly *The Witcher 3*, which has a quest which is a direct sequel to this story. \"A Little Sacrifice\" is a story about mermaids and thwarted romance which takes an interesting turn towards the Lovecraftian and becomes one of the more foreboding stories in the series. \"The Sword of Destiny\" takes the witcher into Brokilon Forest and a confrontation with his destiny, the child Ciri who will become so important in the remaining books.\n\nArguably the highlight of the collection is the concluding story, \"Something More,\" a disjointed story which unfolds in different time periods as Geralt recovers from a serious wound. The story jumps back and forth in time, revisits numerous characters, hints at Geralt's parents and history, and introduces the threat of the Empire of Nilfgaard and its first invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. A surprisingly lyrical and effective mood piece, this may be the best narrative Sapkowski has written to date, remarkable for its effectiveness despite its brevity.\n\nThe result is an extremely strong collection which develops the characters and world in tandem. There aren't many negatives, except that Sapkowski hails from the \"make it up as you go along\" school of worldbuilding, so the failure by anyone to mention the Nilfgaardians or their devastating war before the final story feels a bit odd. There are also issues with the translation: David French feels a lot stronger a translator than Danusia Stok (who translated the first and third books in the series), but there's occasional awkward phrasing, such as the use of the word \"jacket\" rather than a more era-appropriate alternative (\"gambeson\" seems to be a better choice), although this may also be seen as reflecting Sapkowski's preference for modern terms and language.\n\nThis is more than answered by the book's successful exploration of the overall themes of war, loss, romance and hope.\u00a0*Sword of Destiny*\u00a0(\\*\\*\\*\\*\u00bd) is a surprisingly melancholy and thoughtful work which is a very rewarding read, and represents a big improvement over *The Last Wish*."

        "body": "Geralt is a witcher, a hunter of monsters in return for coin. He wanders the northern kingdoms with a trusty steed (always named Roach) and mingles with everyone from kings and generals to sorcerers and vagabonds. Several times Geralt's path crosses that of the powerful, from saving the daughter of King Foltest of Temeria who has been turned into a monstrous striga to resolving a delicate matter for Queen Calanthe of Cintra. But Geralt's destiny is changed when he demands a strange price from Queen Calanthe and makes the acquaintance of a powerful sorceress, Yennefer.\n\n*The Last Wish* (1993, a re-edited version of *The Witcher*, 1990) is the first book in Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's **Witcher** series (which currently runs to eight volumes), although it is not a novel as such. Instead, it is a closely-linked series of short stories, related by Geralt as he recovers from a pitched battle with a striga. The stories work well as stand-alone adventures, but they are also useful in establishing Geralt's character and the tone and nature of the world he inhabits. There is also much scene-setting for the later books featuring the character.\n\nGeralt's world is tough, cold and brutal, drawing more directly on European folklore, fairy tales and mythology than the norm. It's also a world of grudging honour, well-earned fellowship and occasional heroism. Geralt is an entertaining protagonist, being taciturn, cynical and world-weary but also has a wry sense of humour, an enjoyment of good ale and a well-hidden yearning for romance.\n\nThe stories themselves vary in tone but the quality is pretty consistent. There's an undercurrent of whimsical humour in the stories that is very reminiscent of Jack Vance. Like Vance, Sapkowski successfully creates a world where his characters feel totally at home. This world is a mix of the traditional **Dungeon & Dragons** landscape of elves, dwarves and evil wizards, and of darker fairy tales. In this manner the stories' tone and atmosphere is very similar to that of Vance's superb **Lyonesse Trilogy**, although Sapkowski is not as continuously and unrelentingly funny as Vance; he also lacks Vance's gift for intricate wordplay. That said, when the book is funny it's very funny indeed. The comic highlight comes when Geralt and his sometimes travelling troubadour companion Dandillion are confronted by some kind of bizarre goat-man entity whose preferred method of combat is to pelt attackers with iron balls. Under strict instructions not to kill anything in the area, Geralt has to engage the goat-man in a particularly preposterous wrestling match. Sapkowski also employs Vance's melancholy aspect, such as Geralt's musings on a world where the fantastical is dying and the mundane is taking over.\n\nThe translation appears to be adequate, although Polish commentators seem more dubious, and the general feeling is that David French (who translated the later books) does a better job than Danusia Stok (who translates *The Last Wish* and *Blood of Elves*, the first and third books in the series). There's occasional awkward moments (the noble Hereward's rank changes from Prince to Duke at random; sometimes words are repeated very close together) but the stories come through feeling very fresh and energetic. Sapkowski is very good at creating interesting, imaginative characters with unusual levels of depth to them, not least Geralt, whom people are consistently underestimating. Early stories feel slightly repetitive, with Geralt unleashing bloody mayhem to win the day, but in the second half of the book there is a shift in tone with Geralt employing more imaginative methods to overcome the obstacles in his path. There is a great deal left unsaid in the stories in the book: we see the start of Geralt's relationship with the sorceress Yennefer but not its later development, and have to put together what happened with the help of Geralt's thought processes in the framing story. This helps make the book more immersive and less reliant on exposition.\n\n**The Witcher** series also consists of a trilogy of well-regarded and very high-selling video games. Players of the games will appreciate the background to the characters provided here (although Sapkowski does not consider the games to be canon).\n\n*The Last Wish* (\\*\\*\\*\\*) is an enjoyable book full of stories both melancholy and comic, establishing a world and cast of characters that is very intriguing. The novel is available now in the UK and USA. A Netflix TV series based on the books is expected to debut in November 2019."

A young woman guarding a power she cannot control is in the care of a sorceress, whilst the Witcher, Geralt, is fighting off threats to her life. These are perilous times for the Continent.\n\nTime of Contempt is the fourth book (and second full-length novel) in the Witcher series by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. Following directly on from the events of Blood of Elves, the novel follows several storylines in close parallel. Numerous factions are still trying to capture or kill Ciri, the princess and only heir of fallen Cintra. Ciri is in the protection of the sorceress Yennefer, who is also trying to navigate the perils of both international and sorcerous politics. The situation also draws in Geralt, who has been trying to protect Ciri from afar, and puts all three of our protagonists in jeopardy when all-out chaos erupts.\n\nTime of Contempt is an improvement over Blood of Elves, which felt like a very long prologue for the rest of the story. That story really gets underway in Time of Contempt, which mixes character development (particularly Ciri becoming less impetuous), international politics, war and action. If Blood of Elves didn't feel complete as a novel, Time of Contempt is more successful in that area, with a distinct battery of storylines and subplots which further the overall narrative.\n\nThere are some issues. In order for the chaos at Thanedd to really land, the reader should already be familiar with many of the wizards involved from their (oft-brief) appearances in the opening two short stories collections, The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. In fact, several more events during the story only really landed with the appropriate emotional weight because I was familiar with the characters from their chronologically later appearances in The Witcher 3 video game. In the absence of that familiarity, I think the events of this storyline might be much less effective.\n\nOnce the book straightens itself out it does get more compelling, and the concluding section which is effectively a solo adventure for Ciri as she crosses a desert and finds a new band of companions feels like the opening of a bold new storyline for her, one that is cut short by the novel not so much concluding in a thematic or dramatically appropriate way, but just ending as if Sapkowski was working to a strict page count deadline. The storyline continues fairly directly into Baptism of Fire.\n\nTime of Contempt (\\*\\*\\*\\*) is an improvement over the previous Witcher novel and features some very good plot and character development. If it has a weakness, it's that it feels a bit too short and in fact I think the series may have benefited from being released as four fat omnibuses rather than eight shorter novels. Nevertheless, it is another solid installment in the series."

I know there\u2019s a war, and the council of mages (can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called) was split in half by the betrayal of Vilgefortz and the mages he\u2019s aligned with.

But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m missing so many pierces to this story. Why did Tissaia de Vries kill herself, and why did Vilgefortz betray everyone?

I\u2019ve had to sit there for minutes just getting everything straight, and by that point I was tired and burned out so I put down the book.

        "body": "The Northern Kingdoms continue to skirmish with the armies of Nilfgaard along the Yaruga. Rumours have reached Geralt, the witcher, that his ward Ciri has been kidnapped by the Emperor of Nilfgaard, who plans to marry her against her will. Geralt, reluctantly, joins forces with a band of heroes and companions to rescue her.\n\nBaptism of Fire is the third novel (and fifth book) in The Witcher saga by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, following on from Blood of Elves and Time of Contempt. The previous books established the basic plot: the Empire of Nilfgaard is warring with the Northern Kingdoms and absolutely everyone wants to get their hands on Ciri, the princess of fallen Cintra. For some, Ciri is a political prize, through whom one can claim the vacant throne of that kingdom. Others are more interested in her formidable magical skills. For her former mentors, the witcher Geralt and sorceress Yennefer, they just want to protect her from those who would abuse her for their own ends.\n\nThe Witcher books have always been a bit oddly structured - starting with two short story collections before segueing into novels which have felt more like parts of books and not whole ones - and Baptism of Fire continues that trend. From the plot synopsis, you might be expecting a grand adventure in which Geralt traverses half the Continent to rescue Ciri. That doesn't even remotely come close to happening. Instead, Geralt doesn't seem to get more than fifty miles from where he started off, accumulating a bunch of companions along the way. The book then becomes much more interested in exploring these characters and their various personality quirks then in moving the main plot forwards. We do get brief cutaways to Yennefer, Ciri and the political machinations between the kingdoms and the wizards, but mostly the action focuses on Team Geralt.\n\nThis has the makings of an entertaining storyline. Geralt's companions include the redoubtable bard Dandelion (aka Jaskier), the nobleman Regis who is more than he seems, the dwarven mercenary Zoltan Chivay, Nilfgaardian turncoat Cahir and the skilled archer Milva. Their adventures include helping refugees, trying to feed themselves and dealing with superstitious peasants eager to burn strangers as suspected vampires. The characterisation of the party is fun and Sapkowski writes some witty banter between the group.\n\nAfter a while, though, it becomes clear this story isn't really going anywhere fast. Our cutaways to Yennefer and the newly-founded Lodge of Sorceresses, or to various political groups scattered around the Continent, mostly give Sapkowski an excuse to drop huge info-dumps on the political situation. For an author who wrote such skilled, focused short fiction in the first two books in the series, Sapkowski is much less assured at novel-length narratives and becomes embodiment of \"tell, don't show.\" Sapkowski does make some cutting points about the morality of war and how innocents pay the price for the decisions of kings and so on, but by this point these are fairly stock tropes.\n\nAs a serialised chunk of a longer narrative, Baptism of Fire (\\*\\*\\*) is fine. As a novel in its own right, the book doesn't really work, with inconsistent pacing and a reluctance to push forward the main storyline with any urgency or tension. Very solid characterisation and some fun dialogue do keep things ticking over though."

        "body": "[***Sword of Destiny*** **by Andrzej Sapkowski**](https://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2019/10/sword-of-destiny-by-andrzej-sapkowski.html)\n\nGeralt, the witcher, continues his journey through the Northern Kingdoms. He kills dangerous monsters for coin but also finds his path entwining with that of the mighty, of powerful sorceresses, generals and kings. But his journey is also a circle, leading him back to a promise he exacted six years ago from the Queen of Cintra and a price he demanded, but is no longer sure he wants paid.\n\n*Sword of Destiny*\u00a0is the second book in the **Witcher**\u00a0series, following on from *The Last Wish*. Like that book, this is a collection of short stories and novellas linked by Geralt and several other recurring characters, such as the bard Dandelion and the sorceress Yennefer, and also by a thematic element: the growth of Geralt as a character and the realisation that he has a destiny he is unsure he wants fulfilled but may not have any control over.\n\nSeveral of the stories are concerned with Geralt's relationship with Yennefer, and the fact they love one another but also cannot be together, and how they both handle the issue. \"A Shard of Ice\" at first appears to be an amusing love triangle story, with Geralt and a sorcerer squaring off over Yennefer's favour, but it soon becomes powerfully bittersweet and even a little tragic. The opening story, \"The Bounds of Reason,\" feels more like a traditional Geralt romp with the witcher called in to help neutralise the threat of a dragon, only to find matters complicated by politics.\n\n\"Eternal Flame\" may be the most fun story in the collection and sees Geralt visit the great city of Novigrad and have to deal with a doppelganger. A smart and funny story, this is the one that arguably feels the closest to the video games, particularly *The Witcher 3*, which has a quest which is a direct sequel to this story. \"A Little Sacrifice\" is a story about mermaids and thwarted romance which takes an interesting turn towards the Lovecraftian and becomes one of the more foreboding stories in the series. \"The Sword of Destiny\" takes the witcher into Brokilon Forest and a confrontation with his destiny, the child Ciri who will become so important in the remaining books.\n\nArguably the highlight of the collection is the concluding story, \"Something More,\" a disjointed story which unfolds in different time periods as Geralt recovers from a serious wound. The story jumps back and forth in time, revisits numerous characters, hints at Geralt's parents and history, and introduces the threat of the Empire of Nilfgaard and its first invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. A surprisingly lyrical and effective mood piece, this may be the best narrative Sapkowski has written to date, remarkable for its effectiveness despite its brevity.\n\nThe result is an extremely strong collection which develops the characters and world in tandem. There aren't many negatives, except that Sapkowski hails from the \"make it up as you go along\" school of worldbuilding, so the failure by anyone to mention the Nilfgaardians or their devastating war before the final story feels a bit odd. There are also issues with the translation: David French feels a lot stronger a translator than Danusia Stok (who translated the first and third books in the series), but there's occasional awkward phrasing, such as the use of the word \"jacket\" rather than a more era-appropriate alternative (\"gambeson\" seems to be a better choice), although this may also be seen as reflecting Sapkowski's preference for modern terms and language.\n\nThis is more than answered by the book's successful exploration of the overall themes of war, loss, romance and hope.\u00a0*Sword of Destiny*\u00a0(\\*\\*\\*\\*\u00bd) is a surprisingly melancholy and thoughtful work which is a very rewarding read, and represents a big improvement over *The Last Wish*."

        "body": "The Northern Kingdoms continue to skirmish with the armies of Nilfgaard along the Yaruga. Rumours have reached Geralt, the witcher, that his ward Ciri has been kidnapped by the Emperor of Nilfgaard, who plans to marry her against her will. Geralt, reluctantly, joins forces with a band of heroes and companions to rescue her.\n\nBaptism of Fire is the third novel (and fifth book) in The Witcher saga by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, following on from Blood of Elves and Time of Contempt. The previous books established the basic plot: the Empire of Nilfgaard is warring with the Northern Kingdoms and absolutely everyone wants to get their hands on Ciri, the princess of fallen Cintra. For some, Ciri is a political prize, through whom one can claim the vacant throne of that kingdom. Others are more interested in her formidable magical skills. For her former mentors, the witcher Geralt and sorceress Yennefer, they just want to protect her from those who would abuse her for their own ends.\n\nThe Witcher books have always been a bit oddly structured - starting with two short story collections before segueing into novels which have felt more like parts of books and not whole ones - and Baptism of Fire continues that trend. From the plot synopsis, you might be expecting a grand adventure in which Geralt traverses half the Continent to rescue Ciri. That doesn't even remotely come close to happening. Instead, Geralt doesn't seem to get more than fifty miles from where he started off, accumulating a bunch of companions along the way. The book then becomes much more interested in exploring these characters and their various personality quirks then in moving the main plot forwards. We do get brief cutaways to Yennefer, Ciri and the political machinations between the kingdoms and the wizards, but mostly the action focuses on Team Geralt.\n\nThis has the makings of an entertaining storyline. Geralt's companions include the redoubtable bard Dandelion (aka Jaskier), the nobleman Regis who is more than he seems, the dwarven mercenary Zoltan Chivay, Nilfgaardian turncoat Cahir and the skilled archer Milva. Their adventures include helping refugees, trying to feed themselves and dealing with superstitious peasants eager to burn strangers as suspected vampires. The characterisation of the party is fun and Sapkowski writes some witty banter between the group.\n\nAfter a while, though, it becomes clear this story isn't really going anywhere fast. Our cutaways to Yennefer and the newly-founded Lodge of Sorceresses, or to various political groups scattered around the Continent, mostly give Sapkowski an excuse to drop huge info-dumps on the political situation. For an author who wrote such skilled, focused short fiction in the first two books in the series, Sapkowski is much less assured at novel-length narratives and becomes embodiment of \"tell, don't show.\" Sapkowski does make some cutting points about the morality of war and how innocents pay the price for the decisions of kings and so on, but by this point these are fairly stock tropes.\n\nAs a serialised chunk of a longer narrative, Baptism of Fire (\\*\\*\\*) is fine. As a novel in its own right, the book doesn't really work, with inconsistent pacing and a reluctance to push forward the main storyline with any urgency or tension. Very solid characterisation and some fun dialogue do keep things ticking over though."

        "body": "Straight up, I love fantasy and I've been around for awhile - as a reader and as a professional, and over countless events, posts, and interactions,  there a few points of etiquette that I've seen overlooked, with unhappy impacts that could easily have been avoided. Many times, it's due to a lack of experience or a self-absorbed lack of awareness of the impact that lasts long after the interaction is past. While at my age and stage, I'm most likely to move on and forgive, it's important to remember that first impressions are often the most lasting, and that the internet never forgets. The careless post, the casual encounter you didn't think might come back to bite you - can dog your steps for decades.\n\nTherefore, I thought I'd post a few points and open a discussion (please feel free to add to this list/share your own experiences and insights) on the topic of Don't Be This Person. I will alternate between behaviors I've observed from readership and also from professionals, and hopefully share a few insights.\n\nAUTHORS: If you are attending a public event as an attending professional, you are available to the public.\n\nHere's what that means: you have no excuse to disregard or brush off the people who come up to you with a compliment, a question, or just fan gush nerves. This does not mean you cannot extricate yourself (politely) from inappropriate behavior - it does mean, you owe the attendees your attention, your polite ability to listen, and your kindness.\n\nIf you cannot handle this, if you are tired, overwhelmed, unable to function, then, REMOVE YOURSELF from public space. Go private, somewhere and chill out until you refresh your ability to respond.\n\n\nExample: after a recent event was long over, I mentioned to a fellow pro that I'd offered a compliment and in good faith wished to share experience, and got the 'brush off.' I mentioned, yeah, the event was crowded, maybe at another event in the future we could get off on a better footing.\n\nWhat I got back, from this genuine attempt to be civil, peer to peer - was 'Oh, I was too tired to notice anyone speaking to me.\" This progressed to more and more excuses: 'I'd reached the deer in the headlights' point, I'd shut down long ago, I'm a wild child, I was overwhelmed and unable to deal/I'm SPECIAL and I can be rude and it is YOUR fault for not getting it/worship me anyhow in my golden cloud of success.'\n\nNo. Full Stop. I beg to differ. As a guest professional at a con, YOU are there for your readership. You are there to be public, to give your presence TO the event. If you are  an introvert (many of us are) - then it is up to YOU to create your boundaries, and rudeness/staying in public long past the point when you can handle it is a lousy way to treat your admirers. You are perfectly able to GO PRIVATE and take time out/snatch a little break or a rest if tired or overwhelmed, or even, only appear at your scheduled panels, if you are at your best that way. Please don't throw your idiosyncrasies at your following and be rude to them by turning off. And if you are one of those who can't handle crowds or the public, THEN DON'T GO. Know your limits. When a con pays your way, or puts you on a panel, or makes you a part of their program, it is your professional responsibility to be kind, attentive, and give back.\n\nIf you are 'stuck' going to a committee dinner or some function for the organizers and you are 'overwhelmed, or at deer in the headlights' stage - then, if you are approached, acknowledge that. Say \"I appreciate your introducing yourself to me. I'd like to respond, but it's been a long day, I'm at the end of my rope, let's do this another time, can we?\"\n\nI am not speaking of inappropriate behaviors or avoiding stalkers: I am referring to giving polite respect to your public following and treating them with attentive focus. Excuses don't cut it, and neither does the badge reader who (obvious!) checks out who you are/THEN decides if you are 'worth' the time....all comers, please treat your parties equally - the reader who stammers with nerves, to the very famous pro who makes you stammer - it MATTERS. If you are public, BE THERE.\n\nAnything else is acting like a rude jerk, I don't care how many hugo's you've won, or how many times you've been on the best seller list. Don't be this person who treats everyone else as 'less than,' that will be remembered long after you are gone: rejection hurts.\n\nPoint Two is for READERS interacting with pros:\n\nWe've all seen this, \"I've never read your work, blah etc.\" or \"I read your work and didn't like it and blah, etc\" or \"I wrote this review of your work, and I'm tagging you to the link and I HATED IT, and blah....' (Cough, also, same goes for authors tagging a reader's review with defensive posts, that the READER got it wrong - that's for later).\n\nWhy does this shut down any positive avenue? Point by point:\n\n\"I've never read any of your work, and blah blah...\" - You might have consideration for others at the event who HAVE read the work, and your empty taking up space may be putting them off....tell me, what can I say to you? How can we take a conversation from this jump off point? What you've opened up is a very awkward null space from which, no conversation can begin. If you wanted to interact, genuinely, there are many jumping off points that WOULD work and open up common ground:\n\n1) I've heard your name a lot, and I've not had a chance, yet, to see if I'd like your work. Could you help me find an entry point, I've read this, and this, and this, that I loved because this, and this, and this. My favorite plot twists/subjects are, this, and I tend not to like this. What title of yours might fit my interests, and it's OK if there isn't one.\n\nOR: I saw you on this panel and what you said about THAT struck a chord. I'd like to talk more about this (or that) related subject if you have interest on expanding the conversation.\n\nOR: What is your favorite book ever, what themes do you write about that are dearest to your heart, I'd like to know more about how you feel about (name a possible subject of interest).\n\nONE: writers in public are there to honor YOU, they also want to know more about YOU as a person, who you are, what you think is important, just talking about great books - you don't HAVE to be a fan gusher/rabid reader to be of interest as a human being, give yourself credit and treat the person you approach like a human being.\n\nABOVE ALL: don't have this conversation by cornering said person in the rest room/OR by holding them up if they are on the way to a function or appearance. If they are pressed, you can ask: \"what time would be a good moment to connect, later on?\" Over coffee, a beer, or after a signing - there will be an opportunity and if the person is SO FAMOUS they can't fit you in - due to crowds, be understanding. Some pros are introverts and don't do well - be understanding of the ones who only do panels, and duck out. But also: have your warning light ready, sometimes there is an asshole factor, and you don't need to tolerate being treated badly - best to just walk away if your honest respect earns you rudeness.\n\nDon't be the stalker.....following the object of your reader worship all day, everywhere, monopolizing their time is not respectful - it puts off other readers who deserve their chance, and frankly, it's also creepy.\n\nTagging an author in a bad review: Nope. Never. Reviews are for READERS, and they are about YOU. How you reacted to a book, idea, or plot device is YOUR THING. It is about how YOU reacted to the material, all about you....your feelings and responses are yours. If a story angered you, disappointed you, earned your contempt - 'punishing' the creator for how you felt doesn't do anything positive. \"letting them know they 'wrote a bad book' is not 'educational' or 'teaching them a lesson' or 'making them a better writer/human being' or fill in your blank. IF a writer wants to improve their craft, they can DO this on their own  -- go read the criticisms or reactions on a google search/hire or listen to their editor/attend a work shop or consult a respected peer or beta reader. There are plenty of ways for authors to get feedback on their own initiative without you playing God's Gift with a kick in the teeth. Truthfully: sometimes the book or theme or plot device or style WASN\"T WRITTEN FOR YOU in the first place. And if there was a gem in the rough and if craft needed to be improved on (craft not being synonymous with STYLE) - then - there are PROFESSIONAL ways to assess one's work and the true professional will pursue them, relentlessly. You are not the self-appointed arbiter - you have exercised your voice in your review, and that's that. You get to vote with your feet/attract like minded readers who agree with you (or don't) but the author is not part of YOUR process, here. Some authors need to shield themselves when they are working, or even, after a work comes out (it cannot be changed once published, one can only go forward). So THINK - why would you want to inflict your review on the creator in the first place? There will be a reason you had that urge - and it will be about YOU - making your feelings known and usually if you are honest, your anger is about inflicting something back...kindly refrain and be an adult, unless you are ASKED for your opinion or unless you are the professional editor.\n\n\nPoint Three: Authors, Don't Be This Person\n\nAt a conference or appearance, using a fellow pro to 'hide' from your stalkers or over enthusiastic fan base. This person: snags any fellow professional and MONOPOLIZES their time, day in day out, until NOBODY else can get in to meet or greet. The Excuse: I need your cover to HIDE from so and so, or this group, or that overzealous fan. SAVE ME FROM MY OWN. Not only are you taking yourself out of public circulation (why the con had you there in the first place) you are ALSO taking your fellow pro out of circulation - you've made a little clique with a wall that says DO NOT ENTER and you've sucked your sucker pro into playing second fiddle to your need. What happens? AFTER the con, when the event is over - your 'need' is also past - and instead of walking away with a friendship, you left your foil in the dust. Used them, used their good will, used their time, and wiped your hands of it. Manipulation like this is not cool - if you have a problem person, let the convention staff HELP YOU deal with them. Be a pro, man up, take hold of the conversation, make sure others have time and ask the persistent person to back off, straight up, you are there for more than them. Don't use others as a 'shield' from what you don't want to deal with, and if you are SO famous you need crowd control: make that clear to the event so THEY organize it.\n\nMy favorite response: Annie McCaffrey used to RUN OVER TOES with her scooter when she got older and the crowd got too close. Guts and class: she was beloved and old enough to get away with it, but I never saw her build a buffer using OTHERS to run interference - if she needed crowd control, she asked for staff to help.\n\nREADERS point two:\n\n\"I read this title of yours. And, OH, Wow, I read WoT/GoT/Any Very Famous Title  and now - what I want to talk about, ENDLESSLY, is: WoT/GoT/Any Other Famous Title because THAT is what interests me, and you just listen, because: you are surrogate for Jordan (dead) or Martin (not here)....\n\nAnd this gush goes on and on and on.\n\nAuthors may or may not read other works. Some of us DO read a lot, and many times, we may have DIFFERENT tastes in fantasy than you do. (I am not saying I don't like WoT or GoT or name famous title) - I may love them, or be indifferent, or - even - may not have READ them....so a long, detailed gushy discussion about another work that does not happen naturally - is only one-sided - monopolizes the person who's trapped. You definitely know you are the 'surrogate' ear/and it can get tiresome. Particularly if you don't share the same level of adoration - because, as a pro, you don't diss your peers. You don't dampen the enthusiasm of their readership....you haven't much to give back but glassy eyed tolerance. We are not replacements for Author who Isn't There. It's dead obvious you aren't speaking to US, but to someone else.\n\nThere is no REASON not to have a spirited discussion about other works - just, know whom you're speaking to, and realize: hours and hours of this take away from OTHER interactions - if you are going to have a deep discussion of STar Wars, or Star Trek - make sure the conversation is genuinely two sided before launching into your monologue diatribe.\n\nAUTHORS, point three: Don't Be This Person!\nA peer comes up to you, says they have read your work IN DEPTH, here's what they ADMIRE MOST, and HERE is where themes you've written have Common Ground (you may not have read my work, but, there are common themes to both of us) Wow, we could really have a convo about This point, or that, that you have explored so well in your title(s).\n\nWhat to do: have that conversation BOTH WAYS - not just from YOUR side.\n\nWhat not to do: treat your fellow peer as a fan gush whose only purpose is to polish the turd of your 'golden' ego....then proceed to have a HUGE convo all about YOUR stuff/assume the interest is only HERO WORSHIP OF YOU, and then off you go....never imagining this was anything but a fan gush all about YOU/YOUR WORK/YOUR CAREER/YOUR HOPES and Work In Progress....and then assume, from your god like position of self-absorption - that it was All About You, and not an effort to recognize common ground, explore common themes, and in fact, perhaps, have a meaningful TWO WAY discussion. You are not going to come off well out of this one....just saying. This happens A LOT. Try to listen with respect, and not seize the center, relegating the other party to Orbiting Satellite, overtaken by your own Shock and Awe. (Male authors, particularly, here, pay attention if your fellow peer is female, just sayin') My interest in your work is not GIVEN or one way, (unless it is) so PLEASE - don't leap off and stand on that assumption unto self-blindness.\n\nReaders, Final Point:\n\nYou put up with a lot. You have to (maybe) wade through a lot of books to find the ones you love. You may not have people to talk to about books you DO love, and you definitely get the flack sometimes for your peers, who ARE stalkers or rude assholes, or crazy making off the wall. The internet keeps no secrets, it can be entirely unforgiving, and rumors and untruths spring up like Hydra. Please: BE the person who checks and cross checks and applies critical thinking, when internet feuds spring up. Please BE the person who reads both sides, and carefully, forms your INFORMED opinion. Sit back, and take the second wave, because sometimes rumor flies ahead of the truth, and damage can be done: and sometimes TRUTH lags behind, and damage gets done. Be the cool person who stops, thinks, then proceeds. And if you goof, apologize and set the record straight as best you can. Strong people make mistakes, strong people with integrity admit them and make amends (writers, this applies to you, too)\n\nTo finish out, I have always loved the old adage (it has saved me from many many a thoughtless gaff). Before posting or interacting with anyone in this wonderful community, in person on on the internet:\n\nIs it TRUE, is it KIND, is it NECESSARY....very few things pass the bar on all three, and if you choose to by pass one of them, at least, up front, you do so with thoughtful awareness. (Male participants, I know you may be habituated into thinking women are there just to listen to you and you may think you don't have to listen in return - kindly think again and if you can check your privilege for a second, we could all be the richer for it. A female peer saying she likes or loves a work, or has problems with an attitude may ALSO have other things to say or contribute. Listen as an co-equal participant in the conversation, you might be amazed at the response.) Pontificating doesn't grow your ideas one whit/in fact it freezes us both in place. Participation can open up a world of creative exchange and new direction."

Better the one who is honest and open in declaring an agenda than the  one who fools you into believing that they are only spinning a pretty  fancy for beauty\u2019s sake.\u201d*  \n\n\nThis review is about Karen Lord\u2019s 2010 novel *Redemption in Indigo*. Spoilers follow (marked), as well as a discussion of eating disorders.  \n\n\n**So What\u2019s It About? (from Goodreads)**  \n\n\n*\u201cPaama\u2019s  husband is a fool and a glutton. Bad enough that he followed her to her  parents\u2019 home in the village of Makendha\u2014now he\u2019s disgraced himself by  murdering livestock and stealing corn. When Paama leaves him for good,  she attracts the attention of the undying ones\u2014the djombi\u2014 who present  her with a gift: the Chaos Stick, which allows her to manipulate the  subtle forces of the world. Unfortunately, a wrathful djombi with indigo  skin believes this power should be his and his alone.\u201d*  \n\n\n**What I Thought**  \n\n\nThis  is mostly a weird and delightful fable that unfolds before you in a  winningly conversational manner. It truly feels like you\u2019re listening to  an old storyteller spin a yarn, with all of the commentary and little  asides that you would expect from someone telling you a story. It\u2019s a  delightful effect, and it helps that the narrator\u2019s voice is as charming  and clever as it is. The sense of humor that shines throughout is  another strong point:  \n\n\n*\u201c\u2026you have no idea how talking animals  operate. Do you think they would have survived long if they regularly  made themselves known? For that matter, do you think an arachnid with  mouthparts is capable of articulating the phrase \u2018I am a pawnbroker\u2019 in  any known human language?\u201d*  \n\n\n*Redemption in Indigo* features another cruel, ruthless African immortal in the same vein as Octavia Butler\u2019s Doro from *Wild Seed* and Tananarive Due\u2019s David from *My Soul to Keep*.  As befitting the much lighter tone of this book, however, the djombi  ends up being disillusioned because of the unending, thankless nature of  his work with mortals, being confronted with the never-ending problems  of mortality:  \n\n\n*\u201cIt was like being made to play with broken  toys, and the moment a few were fixed to some degree of functionality, a  fresh set of broken ones was pushed his way.\u201d*  \n\n\nAnd, also  befitting the much lighter tone of this book, the whole point of the  book is to >!emphasize that redemption is possible. The djombi learns to  respect mortals again through his relationship with Paama and is his  process of development throughout the book was another of my favorite  aspects of it. !<I think the other theme of the book is that, mortals and  immortals alike, we are all constantly confronted with choices, and that  these choices define us. They may be desperate, wise, calculated or  foolish, but at the end of the day they\u2019re all we are left with.  \n\n\nThere  is one aspect of the book that I debated whether or not to discuss  because I know that my feelings around it are so deeply rooted in  Personal Issues. Ultimately, though, I figured that someone else might  benefit from knowing that this book was kind of difficult to read as  someone in recovery from anorexia because of the way that Paama\u2019s  husband Ansige is treated. He is constantly binging and portrayed as a  bumbling, selfish and foolish character because of his obsessive  relationship with food. Ansige is based on the traditional Senegalese  folk tale of \u201cAnsige Karamba the Glutton\u201d and I know that the intent  behind the character is to portray the dangers of excess of any kind,  but at the same time it did feel as though we were supposed to laugh at  him and hold him in contempt for his behavior- what I could not  interpret as anything other than an eating disorder. I\u2019m not sure that  it totally strays into the territory of fat-shaming, but if you have  ever had a dysfunctional relationship with food in one way or the other  it might feel like people like you are kind of the butt of the joke  here. Towards the end of the story I did feel like he was treated with a  lot more compassion, but this might only have been because>! he was  dying.!<  \n\n\nThe plus side of the focus on food is that there are some truly luscious descriptions of Paama\u2019s cooking:  \n\n\n*\u201cI  could relate for you a description of a morsel of her honey-almond  cake, a delicacy which is light enough to melt on the tip of the tongue  and yet it lingers on the palate with its subtle flavours long into the  dream-filled reaches of the night. I could sing the praises, secondhand,  alas, of her traveller\u2019s soup, a concoction of smoothly blended and  balanced vegetables and herbs guaranteed to put heart and strength back  into the bones of the weariest voyager. I have heard of her pepperpot,  wherein meat from the hunt simmers slowly all the day long in a  fantastic chutney of seasonings, selected spices, peppers, and green  pawpaw. And forgive my tears, but I have just this moment recalled a  certain jar that sits in her kitchen, filled with dried fruit steeping  in spice spirit, red wine, cinnamon, and nutmeg, patiently awaiting that  day months or even years hence when it will be baked into a festival  cake that will turn the head of the most seasonal toper.\u201d*  \n\n\n**The F Word**  \n\n\nThe  story begins with Paama leaving her husband because she will not  tolerate the way that he treats her anymore. In addition, I think Paama  is a very interesting protagonist because she is principally defined by  fairly stereotypical feminine characteristics: her compassion and her  skillful cooking. It\u2019s a great example of a successful and effective  female character who doesn\u2019t simply ape the characteristics typically  associated with masculinity in order to be considered a Strong Female  Character. I also loved the inclusion of a mysterious order of magical  Sisters who can read the future; they reminded me strongly of the Greek  Fates.  \n\n\nFinally, I love that the story is based in a West African  setting and is entirely based on West African folk stories and  mythology, from the previously mentioned \u201cAnsige Karamba the Glutton\u201d to  the inclusion of an animal trickster god that is definitely based on  Anansi.  \n\n\n**About the Author (from Random House Press)**  \n\u201cKaren  Lord has been a physics teacher, diplomat, part-time soldier, and  academic. She is now a writer and research consultant, BSc, MSc, MPhil,  PhD. Her novella *Redemption in Indigo* won the Frank Collymore Literary Award and the William L. Crawford Award, among others. Her novel *The Best of All Possible Worlds*  was published internationally, and won the Frank Collymore Literary  Award, RT Reviewers\u2019 Choice Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and  Locus Awards Best Science Fiction Novel.

Spoilers for the whole series and this book in particular follow! You can also read this review [here.](https://charlottesweb352098924.wordpress.com/2019/11/04/thick-as-thieves-by-meghan-whalen-turner/)\n\n**So What's It About?**\n\nKamet is proud of the power and influence that he has gathered for himself as his master's most trusted slave, but none of his accomplishments can protect him when his master is murdered. Knowing that he will be blamed, Kamet flees for his life with the help of an Attolian soldier. Embarking on a journey that spans the Mede empire, Kamet is determined to regain control over his life no matter what - but his adventure shows his life in an entirely new light, and it becomes clear that more fates than his own hang in the balance.\n\n**What I Thought**\n\nThere are a few things you can always expect from a book in this series. First of all, you may think you know exactly what's happening, but by the end you will have an entirely different understanding of the book's plot. Second of all, you will probably gain this entirely different understanding when Gen, the King of Attolia, waltzes in at the very last possible moment and dramatically reveals the nature of his subtle manipulations and machinations while being a total diva. Whalen Turner's plots are genuinely some of the cleverest I've encountered in fantasy, YA or otherwise, and I always adore that \"Aha!\" moment where\u00a0all of the pieces fall into place.\n\nWhat has been true of the previous books in the series is also true here, but there are several new characteristics that set this book apart. While the previous books were all more or less about royalty and court intrigue, Kamet is a protagonist with much more humble origins. Whalen Turner explores the nature of his enslavement and the transformation of perspective he undergoes so effectively. Over the course of the story, Kamet grapples with what it means to be enslaved, to be a slave on the run and finally what it may mean to be a free man. He is a prideful man in the beginning of his story: so much of his identity is built upon the accomplishments and power that he has accrued in comparison to other slaves, and when the story takes all of that away from him and demands that he build himself back up again from scratch he comes to see what a \"self-deception\" that pride was, given that all of his false power was granted and taken away by the whims of the people who owned him.\n\nHe is forced to consider the strange double bind of worthlessness as a human being and worth as a piece of property that defines existence in slavery:\n\n*\"I considered what I should answer\u2014yes, I had been beneath contempt since birth? Or, on the contrary, that I had once been a man as worthy as himself and had become less of one at some time in my life?\"*\n\nHe learns what it means to have a relationship built upon something other than power and ownership, a sense of superiority to other slaves and/or fundamental mistrust - a relationship that is built on equal regard and respect:\n\n*\"I opened my mouth, and no words came. I didn\u2019t know what to say when \u201csorry\u201d meant something, what to say to an apology that was so obviously sincere.\"*\n\nHe initially mistrusts Costis and looks down on him, so certain is he of the fundamental risk and instability and potential for control in relationships, so certain is he of his own superiority because of the power and education he has accrued. Slowly, he comes to see Costis for the genuine, honest and good person that he is, and a beautiful bromance follows. This gradual development of a trusting relationship is the heart of *Thick as Thieves:\u201cImmakuk and Ennikar,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere?\u201d I snapped my head around to scan the dock, and he nudged me with his elbow.\u201cIdiot. Us,\u201d he said.\u201cOh, of course.\u201d I was squinting down at the dock nonetheless, but I saw nothing out of the ordinary there.*\n\nSpeaking of Immakuk and Ennikar, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the other deviation from the other books of this series, which is the fact that this story takes place on an entirely different continent. Along with the relocation comes an entirely different set of traditions and lore, and I happened to love the unique poetry by which the legends of Immakuk and Ennikar were conveyed. There were some extreme Gilgamesh and Enkidu vibes, what with the resolute, loving friendship between two ancient heroes. Here's a sample of the poetry, and hopefully you can see why I enjoyed it:\n\n*\"Narrow is the bridge between the lands of grainand the lands of sandthe Isthmus evil stalked itTerrifying Unse-Sek son of the Queen of the Nighttower tallsword clawedteeth blood red needle sharpbat head and great bat wingsbarbed at their jointsUnse-Sek stalked the Isthmus in the nighteyes gleaminggleaming like the copper domesof Ianna-Ir in the sunlightIn the dark gleamed Unse-Sek\u2019s eyesas he hunted menwaited until they sleptlurked and leaptThen he devoured them greedy Unse-Sekslurped their marrowleft their bones and gobbets of their fleshscattered on the land.\"*\n\nAnd of course Immakuk makes a timely appearance in Kamet's\u00a0 own story, just in time to nudge events in the right direction for a happy ending. As with everything else in these books, I love the subtlety in the relationship that the heroes have with their gods.\n\n**The F Word**\n\nThere is hardly hide nor hair of a significant female character in this book, unfortunately. I missed Attolia and Eddis a lot! In addition, I have seen some readers argue that the relationship between Costis and Kamet could clearly be understood as the beginnings of a romance, and that Whalen Turner was too ambiguous about this in the ending, when perhaps a less subtle approach would have been appreciated by readers who understood the relationship in that context. I can easily see this perspective, and I can only hope that things are clarified one way or the other in the series' final book. Finally I think this book and its complex depiction of the Mede continent, populated by people of color, is another great example of diversity being a basic part of fantasy world-building without it being exploitative or exotifying. In the past I rather felt like the Medes were the \"bad guys\" of the series, but making Kamet a such an interesting and successful protagonist has helped a lot with that in my view.\n\n**About the Author**\n\nBorn in 1965, Megan Whalen Turner is an American author of fantasy for young adults. She received her BA in English from the University of Chicago, and she is married to cognitive scientist Mark Turner, with whom she has three children.\u00a0 her first book, *The Thief*, was named a Newberry Honor book and it has been followed by four more books in The Queen's Thief series. The sixth and final book in the series is bound to be out in 2020."

        "body": "*\u201cThis is how you survive: one breath to the next, refusing each thought as it comes to you. This is how you get through the worst of things.\u201dThorn* by Intisar Khanani was originally independently published in 2012, and it is now being re-released by a publisher in 2020. I was lucky enough to score an ARC in exchange for an honest review, and I\u2019m equally happy to be discussing the book today. Spoilers follow, as well as a discussion of abuse and sexual violence.\n\n**So What\u2019s It About? (from Goodreads)***\u201cBetween her cruel family and the contempt she faces at court, Princess Alyrra has always longed to escape the confines of her royal life. But when she\u2019s betrothed to the powerful prince Kestrin, Alyrra embarks on a journey to his land with little hope for a better future.When a mysterious and terrifying sorceress robs Alyrra of both her identity and her role as princess, Alyrra seizes the opportunity to start a new life for herself as a goose girl.But Alyrra soon finds that Kestrin is not what she expected. The more Alyrra learns of this new kingdom, the pain and suffering its people endure, as well as the danger facing Kestrin from the sorceress herself, the more she knows she can\u2019t remain the goose girl forever.With the fate of the kingdom at stake, Alyrra is caught between two worlds and ultimately must decide who she is, and what she stands for.\u201d*\n\n**What I Thought**\n\nWhen I\u2019m in the right mood, there is almost nothing that makes me happier than a good fairy tale retelling. There\u2019s just something so endlessly comforting and magical and timeless about them to me, and I\u2019m delighted to report that *Thorn*\u00a0is not just a good fairy tale retelling \u2013 it is an exceedingly thoughtful, graceful and deliberate one. The Goose Girl is not one of my favorite fairy tales, partially because it has so many moving parts that never quite gelled to me, but they are actually all integrated well  here in one cohesive tale. Everything from the talking horse Falada (who is a wonderful character) to the queen\u2019s protective charm, the sentient wind and the princess telling the true story to the hearthstones is included here. And in the manner of the best retellings, there are new and unique elements as well, breathing fresh life into the story.\n\nIn some striking ways I think *Thorn* is really different from the YA fantasies that have been the most successful in recent years, and I found that to be incredibly refreshing. The romance here is almost entirely weighty, thoughtful conversations and slow-building trust and if I remember correctly,>! they don\u2019t even kiss at the end of the story. The villain is ultimately revealed to be a nuanced character who listens to reason, has clear motivations for her actions and displays compassion at the end of the day!<. And, similarly to the other stories I have read by Khanani, the protagonist is deeply concerned with matters of personal accountability and justice.\n\nI read *Thorn* when it was still an indie book, and I know that Khanani revised and added to the book before its mainstream publication. I read the indie version a few years ago so I'm struggling to remember what precisely is different about it, but I do think it's an even stronger story than it was then.\n\n**The F Word**\n\nOne of *Thorn*\u2018s biggest themes is the examination of violence against women. Alyrra comes from a background of abuse from her brother and>! experiences attempted sexual assault during the story. In addition, her friend Violet dies after an attack and sexual assault. Finally, the main villain\u2019s motivation stems from the way that her mother was viciously murdered by a member of the royal family.!< This is a LOT of violence, and by now you probably know the standards that I\u2019ve developed for judging whether violence against women is used in a meaningful  way or an exploitative one:\n\n**1) Does the book present trauma in a psychologically accurate way, providing insight into the lived reality of survivorhood?**\n\nIn *Thorn*\u2018s case the answer is a resounding yes. I think Alyrra is a really well-written character in all regards, but in this regard especially, and I\u2019m still puzzling over how Khanani pulled off what she did with such a graceful and delicate touch. We see Alyrra stuck in silence and shame and absolute disbelief in her own worth and efficacy. There is a huge shift in her behavior after>! Corbe\u2019s attack !<and we see her initial shock and the way that her symptoms increase afterwards. She experiences dissociation and intrusive memories and can only sleep when she is protected by Falada.\n\nA few of her thought processes in particular struck me as viscerally realistic and relatable.\u00a0 She is initially deeply wary and mistrustful of Prince Kestrel because SCHEMAS \u2013 before she knows him as a person she just thinks of him as another prince and princes are dangerous:*\u201cLike my brother, he will either laugh at my anger or hold my impudence against me. I dare not answer him.\u201d*In addition, when she defends herself from>! Corbe\u2019s attack and hurts him!< her main thought after the attack is to blame herself \u2013 that she is just as bad as her abusive brother because she has hurt someone else just like he used to hurt her.  Finally, when she finally breaks her cycle of silence and tells her found family of fellow servants about >!Corbe\u2019s attack,!< the main thing that she feels afterwards is incredibly happy because someone believes her and cares about what has happened to her. To someone who hasn\u2019t experienced abuse this might seem like a really strange response to talking about being hurt but I immediately identified this as something that has happened in my own experience too.\n\n**2) Does the book examine the patriarchal systems and beliefs that facilitate violence against women?**\n\nAgain, the answer is yes here. We see this part of the story mostly with when >!Alyrra\u2019s friend Violet is killed. The book as a whole is deeply aware of class divides and the inordinate burden of violence and oppression that the poor people of any society face, and Khanani is very upfront about the way that justice for women is entirely a class-based affair: \u201cJustice for the poor?\u201d He laughs, sitting back. \u201cThere is justice for the rich here, and justice for the powerful. But for the rest of us, there is very little of anything.\u201d The guards are entirely apathetic about the fate of poor women. Violet is victim-blamed for what she was wearing and the guards are more concerned with whether she \u201cbelongs\u201d to another man than they are concerned with actually seeking out justice \u2013 whether a man\u2019s proprietary claim has been violated rather than whether a woman\u2019s body and mind have been violated. What\u2019s more, privileged (and well-meaning) noble men like Kestrel are unaware of the extent of violence that is happening to poor people, and\u00a0 Alyrra\u2019s class mobility as goose girl and lost princess allows her to experience all of this and be a bridge between worlds and a fighter for what is right.!<\n\n>!My only concern with Violet\u2019s death is that it takes the death of a woman of color to motivate a white woman to realize that she must take action. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve seen in a couple of YA stories recently and it\u2019s a trend that I\u2019m not a fan of for clear reasons. Otherwise, though, I have nothing but good things to say about Khanani\u2019s handling of trauma and violence against women. To me it\u2019s the standout element of a story that is full of excellent elements.!<\n\nAnother thing that I really enjoyed was Alyrra\u2019s struggle with the notions of retribution vs. justice. She is initially disgraced at court because of her willingness to stand up for a servant girl unjustly accused of a crime, and this sets the tone for the rest of the story and her concern with standing up for what is right. >!At first she is glad to have the men who killed Violent killed in turn, but later in the story when she is confronting the Lady she is forced to look at what the unyielding quest for retribution and vengeance may do to a person, and decides that there are other ways of finding justice that may be more effective. She even fights for the girl who stole her identity to be saved from her horrific punishment, although she is not successful in this regard.!< At the end of the story she states that she is still unsure of what the right answer is and is still trying to figure out the right balance between mercy, justice, retribution and vengeance:*\u201cI don\u2019t know what justice really is,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut I am trying to get right what I can.\u201d*I\u2019m right there with Alyrra in this regard.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the book is the extent to which it is a story about the act of acculturating to a new society. It helps that it is a beautiful Middle East inspired world, and it\u2019s especially interesting that while Alyrra loves her new home she is still able to see its flaws and decides to fight to make it a better place.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s the story of a girl who has been hurt learning to overcome her lack of belief in herself to realize that she deserves to exist in the world and can change that world for the better, while also learning that she is worthy of love and connection and kindness for the first time. That is a story that I will read over and over again.\n\n**About the Author (from Goodreads)**\n\n*\u201cIntisar Khanani grew up a nomad and world traveler.

        "body": "When The Witcher was first announced probably my biggest fear was that it would be just another mediocre Netflix series to be lost in an infinite catalog. Pretty much everything I've seen from that moment on has only reinforced that fear.\n\nThe first problem is Schmidt. I don't know who's idea it was to make the showrunner and head writer someone with essentially no accolades. Her most acclaimed work is as a staff writer on West Wing 15 years ago. More recently she wrote a handful of ep's for Daredevil, The Defenders and The Umbrella Academy, none of which are known for their amazing writing or overall quality, to say the least. Apparently she was familiar with the series before being offered the job but I think it's fair to say that it's by no means a passion project for anyone involved on the creative side. I'm sure she's a great person, but I don't know if she was the right choice.\n\nThe second issue I see is the casting. I really like Henry Cavill and they needed someone recognizable to sell the series. I sure he'll make a perfectly fine Gertalt, but I still think he's not the best person for the role. Someone more quiet and reserved ala Mads Mikkelsen would have been much more appropriate. Maybe a beard will help I'll warm up to him. The rest of the casting, it just seems completely uninspired like the rest of the show. At least in GOT there were so many perfectly cast characters, even if they weren't 100% true to the source. Hopefully, the'll prove me wrong.\n\nAs for the rest, I don't know where to start. The Nilfgaardian scrotum armor so bad it's almost unbelavable that it made it past concept art. There is absolutely no way that it's not intentionally meant to look like a penis when paired with the helmet. The Dryads look like the most generic wood elves you could ever imagine. The dresses... The dresses from the games are so stunning and unique, one of the most under-appreciated parts of the games and I don't see anything comparable. As for the rest of the costume design, it's bland. They had so much to work with from CDPR between 5+ games but its as if they ignored 99% of it and instead just settled on raiding the rejected costumes from GOT.\n\nThe story looks far more grandiose than it should be, especially for the first season. Could be the trailers and how they're advertising the show, it is an 8hr series after all but thats the feeling you get. The first two books and the series on a whole are about small intimate stories that take place in a larger world. We don't see the fall of Cintra or these giant battles until way, way down the line. The sets and locations don't seem like anything special. Some of the cinematography looks good some of it not so much. The dialogue from what they have shown feels a little awkward. Yennefer fighting with a sword made me facepalm. It's a ton of little things that by themselves shouldn't bother you but they keep adding up.\n\nFor a series with unbelievable potential, I think they've completely dropped the ball on this one. As I said, I hope I'm wrong. There's a good chance I'm just being a pessimistic, fanboy, ass but I can't shake this feeling at this moment. It looks just ok, and that's what's most disappointing."

Plus, it has the word \"Cyberpunk\" in its own name, indicating a dystopian future where workers and consumers go into constant conflict to the point of civil war against mega-corporations and the wealthy elite.  And I hope to be able to side with either the 1% or the 99% as a way to alter the story somewhat, the same way as with The Witcher trilogy, Gwent, and their wide range of opposing factions.\n\nThoughts?"

Or Commander Shepard from the Mass Effect trilogy going from commanding a ship and squad, to commanding an entire multi-racial fleet at the end of Mass Effect 3.\n\nI'm asking this because whenever I look at, say, adventuring parties in RPGs like Pokemon and Final Fantasy, or five-man band combining super robots like Combattler V, Voltes V, and the Super Sentai mecha, I can't help but think about entire factions, like in Chainmail -- the predecessor to and inspiration for Dungeons & Dragons -- and Mobile Suit Gundam with warring factions like the Earth Federation and Principality of Zeon.  I mean, factions share much of the same group dynamics as a five-man band or any other small group like it.  You have a civilian support staff providing extra men and resources to the frontline soldiers at the home front; the frontline soldiers themselves defending the home front while invading the enemy's home front; and a commanding officer centralizing both frontline soldiers and civilian staff and making life-or-death decisions for them as a collective.  Likewise, the leader is self-explanatory, but the lancer would have served as the second-in-command, while the big guy would have served as a potential frontline soldier himself, and the smart guy and chick/heart would have served a support role like the home front civilian staff.\n\nAnd it's because of that, that a faction would have acted as much like a surrogate family fighting a common enemy together as a five-man band or other smaller ensemble cast of characters.
