Now there have already been plenty of posts about not watching or hate watching the new season, which is crucial so Netflix realizes we don't want nothing season of this disrespect. But now, I suggest something new in addition to that boycott: a full blackout of all Netflix Witcher related content.\n\nIt's simple: Starting tomorrow, I will no longer post or comment anything Netflix Witcher related on this or any other sub, no trailers, no screenshots, no thoughts, I won't watch anything from Netflix on YouTube, or engage with it anywhere else. And I ask all of you to join me in this blackout. Let's show Netflix not only that we will not watch this travesty, but that we will not even tolerate the presence of it, or acknowledge its existence as an adaptation. \n\nSo, who's with me? If there's enough support, perhaps even the mods could enforce the blackout. But regardless, starting tomorrow, at least until the end of Season 3, join me in showing Netflix we've had enough of this disrespect. Let's focus on the books and games, on the good, and eviscerate the Netflix show, the bad, from public consciousness."

        "body": "So, ehm, Blood Origin is finally out and we can bask in its terribleness. I get that lots of fans are not interested, so I thought I might do a little review for ya, so you do not need to suffer like me.  \n\nFirst, I'm not a native English speaker, so apologies. I will also go into the story, so SPOILER ALLERT!  \n\nAnyways, the story picks up 1200 years before the current Netflix show, the continent is pre-conjunction and the elves rule it all. Now, I say \"elves,\" but these are not elves, they have nothing in common with how we, the fans, imagine elves would behave and look like. They live in human-looking cities, literally look like humans (save for the ears) and BEHAVE like them. Not those nature-loving phylosophical beings, they have all the bad humans traits you can think of. One of the mains characters literally acts like a dude from modern day, sending F-word left and right and at some point he even wants to go to a brothel a fuck some other elves, because apparently that's what elves do I guess.  \n\nAnyways, this character is called Fjall, he is the elf who looks like a modern dude and wears a fucking trench coat. He got banished from his clan because he fucked a princess (this princess was so forgetable that I am just gonna call her the princess that got fucked by Fjall). Later he runs into Eille, another outcast who had decided to roam the land and sing... yea..  \n\nAnyways, in Cintra (which they all call Xintrea, its old elven name, that's actually lore accurate) Eredin (yes, that EREDIN), the princess who got fucked by Fjall and Lenny Henry (he was so forgetable that I will just keep calling him Lenny Henry) organised the coup, killed all 3 monarchs who were discussing peace and named the princess that got fucked by Fjall an Empress. Fast forward now the continent is united under the Golden Empire ruled by Empress the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Eredin is their main general and Lenny Henry their main mage. Fjall and Eille hear about the coup (their clans were present and were masaccred too) and they swore revenge and decided to go there and kill the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Oh and Eille has a sister who gets killed pretty much in the begining and the acting from Eille is one of the worst acting sequences I have ever seen. Her sister gets killed and Eille is completely fine with that. No crying, no anything. She is just angry, buries her and swears revenge. And dips of.   \n\nAnyways, Fjall and Eille travel the world and start picking up other characters who have no reason to ever join them, yet they do it anyways. They pick up one dude who they had never met before, who just says he is a good killer and wants to join them. They literally just accept him, because why not. Why wouldn't you put a trust in a person you have never met before? Then pretty much nothing happens until the last episode. Lenny Henry does some bullshit with the monoliths to gain power and the princess who got fucked by Fjall wants together with Eredin to colonise other worlds...  \n\nAnyways, the group gets bigger and bigger until there are 7 of them and then they get to Cintra, mutate Fjall to be the first Witcher (yea, apparently AN ELF is the first Witcher, LMAO), Fjall and Eille fall in love, one of the members fakes-betraying them to bamboozle some Cintrian soldiers to come and take them, so they can be killed and the group can wear their armours to get to Cintra.  \n\nAnd then the group and angry Cintrian inhabitants (who are angry because they are hungry) organise a rebellion to overthrow Eredin, Lenny Henry and the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Fjall mutations start kicking in and he turns into the Hulk who destroys Lenny Henry\u00b4s monster and then turns evil and tries to kill his friends, but the song from Eille calms him (I am not joking right now) and she has the opportunity to get close to him, says she will always love him and stabs him into the heart. \n\nThe princess who got fucked by Fjall gets stabbed by Eille and dies, Lenny Henry gets killed when one mage of the group joins his power with the monolith and destroys it, Lenny Henry and himself. Eredin gets banished to another world where he picks up the helmet he has in S2 and conjuction happens... And that is where it ends.  \n\nYea, that was the story. It is obviously woke as shit, there are people of every race and gender (no Slavic actors of course, why would there be any, right?) elves are literally humans with pointed ears, in terms of look and behaviour and the whole 4 hour long watch is a waste of time.  \n\n\nPS: Eredin is gay, yes, really.  \n\nPS 2: Some pretender who calls himself \"Avalach\" is in the story and he is basically a puppet of the princess who got fucked by Fjall. He is a petty twink who looks like the type that gets intimidated by loud noises.\n\n\nTLDR: It is an absolute garbage, only watch it if you are prepared to hate it.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your awards, folks! Since this post is getting a traction and I keep getting the same questions over and over again, I will answer some of them here instead.\n\n1) I am not joking about Eredin. He is gay, has a boyfriend and they bang. \n\n2) Yes, I do feel that the Witcher series is *mostly* Slavic and that mixing all kinds of races into the same spot without any explanation or reason is wrong. I am not saying this should be all-white cast, but if you include colored people, do it so it makes sense. Don't just shove them in the society that hates Witchers (who are just mutated superhumans), but somehow tolerates people with different skin colour??? If you find that racist, then so be it.\n\n3) I haven't specified that, but the main reason they created the Witcher was that Lenny Henry created a magical monster that zaps people out of existence and they needed someone to fight it. Here comes Fjall.\n\n4) And the last thing - the only thing I genuinely like about the show was the music and the Dwarf woman. The actress who played her was *PHENOMENAL*"

Now there have already been plenty of posts about not watching or hate watching the new season, which is crucial so Netflix realizes we don't want nothing season of this disrespect. But now, I suggest something new in addition to that boycott: a full blackout of all Netflix Witcher related content.\n\nIt's simple: Starting tomorrow, I will no longer post or comment anything Netflix Witcher related on this or any other sub, no trailers, no screenshots, no thoughts, I won't watch anything from Netflix on YouTube, or engage with it anywhere else. And I ask all of you to join me in this blackout. Let's show Netflix not only that we will not watch this travesty, but that we will not even tolerate the presence of it, or acknowledge its existence as an adaptation. \n\nSo, who's with me? If there's enough support, perhaps even the mods could enforce the blackout. But regardless, starting tomorrow, at least until the end of Season 3, join me in showing Netflix we've had enough of this disrespect. Let's focus on the books and games, on the good, and eviscerate the Netflix show, the bad, from public consciousness."

        "body": "So, ehm, Blood Origin is finally out and we can bask in its terribleness. I get that lots of fans are not interested, so I thought I might do a little review for ya, so you do not need to suffer like me.  \n\nFirst, I'm not a native English speaker, so apologies. I will also go into the story, so SPOILER ALLERT!  \n\nAnyways, the story picks up 1200 years before the current Netflix show, the continent is pre-conjunction and the elves rule it all. Now, I say \"elves,\" but these are not elves, they have nothing in common with how we, the fans, imagine elves would behave and look like. They live in human-looking cities, literally look like humans (save for the ears) and BEHAVE like them. Not those nature-loving phylosophical beings, they have all the bad humans traits you can think of. One of the mains characters literally acts like a dude from modern day, sending F-word left and right and at some point he even wants to go to a brothel a fuck some other elves, because apparently that's what elves do I guess.  \n\nAnyways, this character is called Fjall, he is the elf who looks like a modern dude and wears a fucking trench coat. He got banished from his clan because he fucked a princess (this princess was so forgetable that I am just gonna call her the princess that got fucked by Fjall). Later he runs into Eille, another outcast who had decided to roam the land and sing... yea..  \n\nAnyways, in Cintra (which they all call Xintrea, its old elven name, that's actually lore accurate) Eredin (yes, that EREDIN), the princess who got fucked by Fjall and Lenny Henry (he was so forgetable that I will just keep calling him Lenny Henry) organised the coup, killed all 3 monarchs who were discussing peace and named the princess that got fucked by Fjall an Empress. Fast forward now the continent is united under the Golden Empire ruled by Empress the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Eredin is their main general and Lenny Henry their main mage. Fjall and Eille hear about the coup (their clans were present and were masaccred too) and they swore revenge and decided to go there and kill the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Oh and Eille has a sister who gets killed pretty much in the begining and the acting from Eille is one of the worst acting sequences I have ever seen. Her sister gets killed and Eille is completely fine with that. No crying, no anything. She is just angry, buries her and swears revenge. And dips of.   \n\nAnyways, Fjall and Eille travel the world and start picking up other characters who have no reason to ever join them, yet they do it anyways. They pick up one dude who they had never met before, who just says he is a good killer and wants to join them. They literally just accept him, because why not. Why wouldn't you put a trust in a person you have never met before? Then pretty much nothing happens until the last episode. Lenny Henry does some bullshit with the monoliths to gain power and the princess who got fucked by Fjall wants together with Eredin to colonise other worlds...  \n\nAnyways, the group gets bigger and bigger until there are 7 of them and then they get to Cintra, mutate Fjall to be the first Witcher (yea, apparently AN ELF is the first Witcher, LMAO), Fjall and Eille fall in love, one of the members fakes-betraying them to bamboozle some Cintrian soldiers to come and take them, so they can be killed and the group can wear their armours to get to Cintra.  \n\nAnd then the group and angry Cintrian inhabitants (who are angry because they are hungry) organise a rebellion to overthrow Eredin, Lenny Henry and the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Fjall mutations start kicking in and he turns into the Hulk who destroys Lenny Henry\u00b4s monster and then turns evil and tries to kill his friends, but the song from Eille calms him (I am not joking right now) and she has the opportunity to get close to him, says she will always love him and stabs him into the heart. \n\nThe princess who got fucked by Fjall gets stabbed by Eille and dies, Lenny Henry gets killed when one mage of the group joins his power with the monolith and destroys it, Lenny Henry and himself. Eredin gets banished to another world where he picks up the helmet he has in S2 and conjuction happens... And that is where it ends.  \n\nYea, that was the story. It is obviously woke as shit, there are people of every race and gender (no Slavic actors of course, why would there be any, right?) elves are literally humans with pointed ears, in terms of look and behaviour and the whole 4 hour long watch is a waste of time.  \n\n\nPS: Eredin is gay, yes, really.  \n\nPS 2: Some pretender who calls himself \"Avalach\" is in the story and he is basically a puppet of the princess who got fucked by Fjall. He is a petty twink who looks like the type that gets intimidated by loud noises.\n\n\nTLDR: It is an absolute garbage, only watch it if you are prepared to hate it.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your awards, folks! Since this post is getting a traction and I keep getting the same questions over and over again, I will answer some of them here instead.\n\n1) I am not joking about Eredin. He is gay, has a boyfriend and they bang. \n\n2) Yes, I do feel that the Witcher series is *mostly* Slavic and that mixing all kinds of races into the same spot without any explanation or reason is wrong. I am not saying this should be all-white cast, but if you include colored people, do it so it makes sense. Don't just shove them in the society that hates Witchers (who are just mutated superhumans), but somehow tolerates people with different skin colour??? If you find that racist, then so be it.\n\n3) I haven't specified that, but the main reason they created the Witcher was that Lenny Henry created a magical monster that zaps people out of existence and they needed someone to fight it. Here comes Fjall.\n\n4) And the last thing - the only thing I genuinely like about the show was the music and the Dwarf woman. The actress who played her was *PHENOMENAL*"

Both abide by a code of honor that they are bound to uphold. In both stories, the Witchers/Jedis have been almost eradicated and only a few still remains. Kaer Moren is like a Jedi Temple for the Witchers, a place where they can rest with their similars. Witchers and Jedi are both seens as strange or/and feared by the outer world.   \nBoth master sword fighting and utilize a form of magic, such as the use of Axii, which can induce mind control, or Aard, which can be likened to a Force push.   \n\n\n   Another similarity I can't help but notice is the presence of a powerful, dark force that threatens the safety of the world. In the Witcher books, it is the Nilfgaard Empire and the power of the Wild Hunt, while in Star Wars it is the Empire and the power of the Dark Side of the Force. Both series also feature a hero's journey where the main character, Geralt and Luke Skywalker, starts as a lone wanderer and becomes a hero through a series of events and experiences. Both series feature a strong focus on the concept of destiny and the idea that certain characters are meant to play a larger role in the fate of the world.   \n\n\nWhat do you think ?"

Now there have already been plenty of posts about not watching or hate watching the new season, which is crucial so Netflix realizes we don't want nothing season of this disrespect. But now, I suggest something new in addition to that boycott: a full blackout of all Netflix Witcher related content.\n\nIt's simple: Starting tomorrow, I will no longer post or comment anything Netflix Witcher related on this or any other sub, no trailers, no screenshots, no thoughts, I won't watch anything from Netflix on YouTube, or engage with it anywhere else. And I ask all of you to join me in this blackout. Let's show Netflix not only that we will not watch this travesty, but that we will not even tolerate the presence of it, or acknowledge its existence as an adaptation. \n\nSo, who's with me? If there's enough support, perhaps even the mods could enforce the blackout. But regardless, starting tomorrow, at least until the end of Season 3, join me in showing Netflix we've had enough of this disrespect. Let's focus on the books and games, on the good, and eviscerate the Netflix show, the bad, from public consciousness."

        "body": "So, ehm, Blood Origin is finally out and we can bask in its terribleness. I get that lots of fans are not interested, so I thought I might do a little review for ya, so you do not need to suffer like me.  \n\nFirst, I'm not a native English speaker, so apologies. I will also go into the story, so SPOILER ALLERT!  \n\nAnyways, the story picks up 1200 years before the current Netflix show, the continent is pre-conjunction and the elves rule it all. Now, I say \"elves,\" but these are not elves, they have nothing in common with how we, the fans, imagine elves would behave and look like. They live in human-looking cities, literally look like humans (save for the ears) and BEHAVE like them. Not those nature-loving phylosophical beings, they have all the bad humans traits you can think of. One of the mains characters literally acts like a dude from modern day, sending F-word left and right and at some point he even wants to go to a brothel a fuck some other elves, because apparently that's what elves do I guess.  \n\nAnyways, this character is called Fjall, he is the elf who looks like a modern dude and wears a fucking trench coat. He got banished from his clan because he fucked a princess (this princess was so forgetable that I am just gonna call her the princess that got fucked by Fjall). Later he runs into Eille, another outcast who had decided to roam the land and sing... yea..  \n\nAnyways, in Cintra (which they all call Xintrea, its old elven name, that's actually lore accurate) Eredin (yes, that EREDIN), the princess who got fucked by Fjall and Lenny Henry (he was so forgetable that I will just keep calling him Lenny Henry) organised the coup, killed all 3 monarchs who were discussing peace and named the princess that got fucked by Fjall an Empress. Fast forward now the continent is united under the Golden Empire ruled by Empress the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Eredin is their main general and Lenny Henry their main mage. Fjall and Eille hear about the coup (their clans were present and were masaccred too) and they swore revenge and decided to go there and kill the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Oh and Eille has a sister who gets killed pretty much in the begining and the acting from Eille is one of the worst acting sequences I have ever seen. Her sister gets killed and Eille is completely fine with that. No crying, no anything. She is just angry, buries her and swears revenge. And dips of.   \n\nAnyways, Fjall and Eille travel the world and start picking up other characters who have no reason to ever join them, yet they do it anyways. They pick up one dude who they had never met before, who just says he is a good killer and wants to join them. They literally just accept him, because why not. Why wouldn't you put a trust in a person you have never met before? Then pretty much nothing happens until the last episode. Lenny Henry does some bullshit with the monoliths to gain power and the princess who got fucked by Fjall wants together with Eredin to colonise other worlds...  \n\nAnyways, the group gets bigger and bigger until there are 7 of them and then they get to Cintra, mutate Fjall to be the first Witcher (yea, apparently AN ELF is the first Witcher, LMAO), Fjall and Eille fall in love, one of the members fakes-betraying them to bamboozle some Cintrian soldiers to come and take them, so they can be killed and the group can wear their armours to get to Cintra.  \n\nAnd then the group and angry Cintrian inhabitants (who are angry because they are hungry) organise a rebellion to overthrow Eredin, Lenny Henry and the princess that got fucked by Fjall. Fjall mutations start kicking in and he turns into the Hulk who destroys Lenny Henry\u00b4s monster and then turns evil and tries to kill his friends, but the song from Eille calms him (I am not joking right now) and she has the opportunity to get close to him, says she will always love him and stabs him into the heart. \n\nThe princess who got fucked by Fjall gets stabbed by Eille and dies, Lenny Henry gets killed when one mage of the group joins his power with the monolith and destroys it, Lenny Henry and himself. Eredin gets banished to another world where he picks up the helmet he has in S2 and conjuction happens... And that is where it ends.  \n\nYea, that was the story. It is obviously woke as shit, there are people of every race and gender (no Slavic actors of course, why would there be any, right?) elves are literally humans with pointed ears, in terms of look and behaviour and the whole 4 hour long watch is a waste of time.  \n\n\nPS: Eredin is gay, yes, really.  \n\nPS 2: Some pretender who calls himself \"Avalach\" is in the story and he is basically a puppet of the princess who got fucked by Fjall. He is a petty twink who looks like the type that gets intimidated by loud noises.\n\n\nTLDR: It is an absolute garbage, only watch it if you are prepared to hate it.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your awards, folks! Since this post is getting a traction and I keep getting the same questions over and over again, I will answer some of them here instead.\n\n1) I am not joking about Eredin. He is gay, has a boyfriend and they bang. \n\n2) Yes, I do feel that the Witcher series is *mostly* Slavic and that mixing all kinds of races into the same spot without any explanation or reason is wrong. I am not saying this should be all-white cast, but if you include colored people, do it so it makes sense. Don't just shove them in the society that hates Witchers (who are just mutated superhumans), but somehow tolerates people with different skin colour??? If you find that racist, then so be it.\n\n3) I haven't specified that, but the main reason they created the Witcher was that Lenny Henry created a magical monster that zaps people out of existence and they needed someone to fight it. Here comes Fjall.\n\n4) And the last thing - the only thing I genuinely like about the show was the music and the Dwarf woman. The actress who played her was *PHENOMENAL*"

        "body": "I know we all have talked to death about how much the Netflix series sucks to death, but with the looming dread of a \"The Rats\" focused Spinoff, I want to get my thoughts on something that really infuriated me. and it's something I only came to realize recently.\n\nAnd that is how the Flixer team has basically ruined every aspect of Ciri's character and development.\n\nThe first and honestly biggest one.\n\n\\-Geralt: No longer is Geralt and Ciri's relationship a bond of familial love and care formed by two lonely people that meet by the power of fate, and destiny, but show to each other that their relationship is something more than just destiny. Something more than what every other person that comes into their path tells them they have a role they must follow and that they should just accept it.\n\nin the show, there is NOTHING more to their relationship. they meet by chance and there is nothing that connects them on any sort of level. in fact the show has to ruin Skellige with a single line in order to give a reason to Ciri to even stay with Geralt, while in the books, it's Ciri's choice and she CHOOSES Geralt.\n\nSpeaking on the Isles....\n\n\\-Skellige: A place that until Kaer Morhen, was Ciri's second home. a place she holds dear to her heart, and where her uncle Crach an Craite would do anything for her, and where she is respected and welcome more than anywhere else on the continent. a place where Crach sees Ciri as his own, and loves her as such.\n\nIn the Netflix show, apparently from Geralt himself, if Ciri were to go to Skellige. Crach wouldn't give any less of a shit about Ciri and simply marry her off to the first lord he'd see and be done with her. They make Skellige sound no better than any other place within the Northern realms because they due to not properly setting up Ciri and Geralt's bond and love for each other. they had to ruin Ciri's other home and one of the few people she has left at that point she calls family. (Seriously fuck you Lauren for approving that.)\n\nnext up and speaking of ruining second homes....\n\n\\-The Witchers: Not only do they reduce the Witchers of Kaer Morhen into moronic frat boys, and turn the kindest Witcher of all, Eskle into an absolute douche-canoe. they then killed him. but with there now being so many jobber Witchers around, it takes away the intimacy Kaer Morhen has in the books. as the few Witchers that come to winter there embrace in each other's warmth, collect and share with each other stories and hopes that come the next winter they'll see each other again. gone is the family that welcomed Ciri with open arms when knowing how important she is to Geralt, and how important it is to teach her how to survive and protect herself.\n\nReplaced with an overly crowded bunch of assholes that treat her like shit, and mock her for her shortcomings instead of helping her grow and looking like they want to throw her out as soon as they can. They aren't a family, not to Ciri, barely even to each other. They took Vesimir and instead of a wise Witcher who just wants to see his boys come home safe, and instead becomes an obsessive bastard that's eager and ready to subject his son's daughter to a torturous experience and wants to subject even more when he sees the possibility within reach. Then thanks to they're rip off O'dimm. they destroy what little of a positive relationship she had with the Witchers by having Ciri butcher several of them, and show all of them ready to kill her without hesitation. (Again, fuck you, Lauren.)\n\nLeaving the discussion of Kaer Morhen and on the road....\n\n\\-Yarpen Zigren: The wise Dwarf trying to do his best, and someone Ciri builds a true friendship with during her travels with Geralt and Triss to the temple of Melitele. While their time together isn't as long as with many others, the time leaves an impact on Ciri as she is brought full force by the reality of how those in power treat those they deem beneath them and how they are treated. and the consequences that come from such treatment.\n\nSeeing Yarpin doing his best to live an honest life and seeing him forced to kill his own people for a mission be believed to show his character, only to realize he wasn't even given the same trust he put into the one who employed him and realizes that the lives lost during his \"Test\" were worth so little by a king. She sees this along with the small taste of the heartbreak and horror of what war can bring.\n\nin the show.....nothing......in fact, they barely interact for more than a minute.\n\n\\-Yennefer: the woman Ciri came to see and love as her mother, and a bond that is nearly on the same level as her bond with Geralt. Yennefer's love and care for Ciri is only rivaled by Geralt and she shows it with every free action she makes involving Ciri. Doing everything she can and thinks will help and be best for her. Yennefer would do anything for Ciri and would give her life if she knew it would ensure Ciri's safety for the rest of her life.\n\nIn the Flixer, Yenn tries to kill Ciri, despite knowing how much Geralt cares about Ciri, despite knowing how important Ciri is. Netflix Yennefer is NOT YENNEFER. she doesn't act like Yennefer, she doesn't talk like Yennefer, she is less than a cardboard cutout with a sign that says she is. I don't know who this character is, but after what she tried to pull, any possibility of a positive relationship between her and Ciri is absolutely nuked, along with Geralt. because you know what Geralt does to people that threaten and put Ciri in intentional harm's way?\n\nHe fucking kills them.\n\n(once again. Lauren, fuck you, Flixer Writers, fuck you. Netflix, fuck you for even hiring these hacks.)\n\nand I want to apologize to all the actors, and crew who have had to endure this shitstorm of crap.\n\nEdit: quick thing to add. \n\nif they do get that Rats spin off. much like the rest of the series, they are going to miss the point and fuck it up.

She is a master fencer and can compensate for her lack of superhuman speed and senses with her teleporting powers. But she hasn\u00b4t gone through the mutations, so she can\u00b4t use the potions that are essential for a witcher. She can't drink oriole, so the first time an arachas or an endrega spits poison on her she is done. Neither does she have natural immunity, so even a simple drowner could kill her if it manages to scratch her and the wound gets infected.\n\nMost people don't like the empress ending because she would be far from Geralt, Yennefer and the rest of her friends and loves ones, but that's not the case. She is the Lady of Space and Time, without the menace of the Wild Hunt, she can move to anywhere in any world at any time with no effort. She would be able to teleport to Corvo Bianco, have breakfast with Geralt and Yennefer and return to the imperial palace in Nilfgaard in the blink of an eye.\n\nOthers argue that she would be forced to marry Morvran Voorhis. He isn\u00b4t an evil old man or anything, she could even like him, but if she doesn't, judging by the dialogue she has if she visits Corvo bianco, I doubt \"papa Emhir\" would force anything on her.\n\nEdit:  I'm not saying that she's not powerful, she could easily defeat Geralt, Eredin and pretty much any character. My point is that her lack of mutations makes her vulnerable to some of the risks witchers face in their work, such as poison and infection. If a grave hag manages to wound her before she slices it in half with her sword, that wound could get infected pretty easily and that could mean a death sentence in a medieval world with no  antibiotics. Geralt or any other witchers don't have that problem because they are immune to disease. The same goes for poison. "

However, I think It's kinda growing on me. First of all, I get the feeling people hate Radovid and believe him to be too bad a person to be involved in something like this. Let's remember that the games aren't canon and Radovid doesn't necessarily need to turn into a maniac in the end. Even if he does, at this time in the show, he's still a normal guy. I can see him being the smarter, charming brother who can make politics interesting. Jaskier being bi also doesn't seem that out of character. The only problem is how they're going to adapt a certain other relationship he has later in the books.\n\nI think aging Radovid up and making him a love interest for Jaskier can have a positive effect on both the political matters and Jaskier's involvement in the story. That is, of course, if the writing doesn't ruin it. The show is almost dead at this point, so I don't really care how this happens in the show. Theoretically though, I think these changes could be acceptable and even perhaps interesting."

Like Stregobor mentioning Falka's rebellion as an anecdote in season 1 and then him having an obsession about it in season 2. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but it's like the writing team had to scrounge and scrape for every tiny piece of content from their previous season to fill time with for season 2."

        "body": "I know we all have talked to death about how much the Netflix series sucks to death, but with the looming dread of a \"The Rats\" focused Spinoff, I want to get my thoughts on something that really infuriated me. and it's something I only came to realize recently.\n\nAnd that is how the Flixer team has basically ruined every aspect of Ciri's character and development.\n\nThe first and honestly biggest one.\n\n\\-Geralt: No longer is Geralt and Ciri's relationship a bond of familial love and care formed by two lonely people that meet by the power of fate, and destiny, but show to each other that their relationship is something more than just destiny. Something more than what every other person that comes into their path tells them they have a role they must follow and that they should just accept it.\n\nin the show, there is NOTHING more to their relationship. they meet by chance and there is nothing that connects them on any sort of level. in fact the show has to ruin Skellige with a single line in order to give a reason to Ciri to even stay with Geralt, while in the books, it's Ciri's choice and she CHOOSES Geralt.\n\nSpeaking on the Isles....\n\n\\-Skellige: A place that until Kaer Morhen, was Ciri's second home. a place she holds dear to her heart, and where her uncle Crach an Craite would do anything for her, and where she is respected and welcome more than anywhere else on the continent. a place where Crach sees Ciri as his own, and loves her as such.\n\nIn the Netflix show, apparently from Geralt himself, if Ciri were to go to Skellige. Crach wouldn't give any less of a shit about Ciri and simply marry her off to the first lord he'd see and be done with her. They make Skellige sound no better than any other place within the Northern realms because they due to not properly setting up Ciri and Geralt's bond and love for each other. they had to ruin Ciri's other home and one of the few people she has left at that point she calls family. (Seriously fuck you Lauren for approving that.)\n\nnext up and speaking of ruining second homes....\n\n\\-The Witchers: Not only do they reduce the Witchers of Kaer Morhen into moronic frat boys, and turn the kindest Witcher of all, Eskle into an absolute douche-canoe. they then killed him. but with there now being so many jobber Witchers around, it takes away the intimacy Kaer Morhen has in the books. as the few Witchers that come to winter there embrace in each other's warmth, collect and share with each other stories and hopes that come the next winter they'll see each other again. gone is the family that welcomed Ciri with open arms when knowing how important she is to Geralt, and how important it is to teach her how to survive and protect herself.\n\nReplaced with an overly crowded bunch of assholes that treat her like shit, and mock her for her shortcomings instead of helping her grow and looking like they want to throw her out as soon as they can. They aren't a family, not to Ciri, barely even to each other. They took Vesimir and instead of a wise Witcher who just wants to see his boys come home safe, and instead becomes an obsessive bastard that's eager and ready to subject his son's daughter to a torturous experience and wants to subject even more when he sees the possibility within reach. Then thanks to they're rip off O'dimm. they destroy what little of a positive relationship she had with the Witchers by having Ciri butcher several of them, and show all of them ready to kill her without hesitation. (Again, fuck you, Lauren.)\n\nLeaving the discussion of Kaer Morhen and on the road....\n\n\\-Yarpen Zigren: The wise Dwarf trying to do his best, and someone Ciri builds a true friendship with during her travels with Geralt and Triss to the temple of Melitele. While their time together isn't as long as with many others, the time leaves an impact on Ciri as she is brought full force by the reality of how those in power treat those they deem beneath them and how they are treated. and the consequences that come from such treatment.\n\nSeeing Yarpin doing his best to live an honest life and seeing him forced to kill his own people for a mission be believed to show his character, only to realize he wasn't even given the same trust he put into the one who employed him and realizes that the lives lost during his \"Test\" were worth so little by a king. She sees this along with the small taste of the heartbreak and horror of what war can bring.\n\nin the show.....nothing......in fact, they barely interact for more than a minute.\n\n\\-Yennefer: the woman Ciri came to see and love as her mother, and a bond that is nearly on the same level as her bond with Geralt. Yennefer's love and care for Ciri is only rivaled by Geralt and she shows it with every free action she makes involving Ciri. Doing everything she can and thinks will help and be best for her. Yennefer would do anything for Ciri and would give her life if she knew it would ensure Ciri's safety for the rest of her life.\n\nIn the Flixer, Yenn tries to kill Ciri, despite knowing how much Geralt cares about Ciri, despite knowing how important Ciri is. Netflix Yennefer is NOT YENNEFER. she doesn't act like Yennefer, she doesn't talk like Yennefer, she is less than a cardboard cutout with a sign that says she is. I don't know who this character is, but after what she tried to pull, any possibility of a positive relationship between her and Ciri is absolutely nuked, along with Geralt. because you know what Geralt does to people that threaten and put Ciri in intentional harm's way?\n\nHe fucking kills them.\n\n(once again. Lauren, fuck you, Flixer Writers, fuck you. Netflix, fuck you for even hiring these hacks.)\n\nand I want to apologize to all the actors, and crew who have had to endure this shitstorm of crap.\n\nEdit: quick thing to add. \n\nif they do get that Rats spin off. much like the rest of the series, they are going to miss the point and fuck it up.

Though, many would say that its a mess of her own making.\n\nDespite claiming to stay true to the books in interviews, the show has drifted away from its source material with each passing season. This abandonment of Sapkowski's books hasn't gone unnoticed, and things escalated to the point where the self claimed super fan and the star of the show, Henry Cavill walked away from what he called his dream role.\n\nAs the promotion tour for season three kicks off, Lauren Hissrich has addressed one of the elephants in the room.\n\n*\"Showrunner Lauren Hissrich tells EW she received a lot of feedback from viewers about Yennefer's acts last season. \"'How could you do that to these characters?' 'They'll never be able to forgive her.' Well, that just becomes a story problem for us,\" she says. \"How do two characters forgive each other?\" Her mind immediately went to Beltane, a festival during which both Yen and Ciri were born. Viewers will see the enchantress' \"romantic reconnections\" with Geralt play out here, Hissrich teases. \" - EW*\n\nRomantic reconnections? What *\"romantic reconnections?\"*\n\nSpoilers for those who did not care to watch season two, but instead of becoming a mother figure to Ciri, Yennefer tried to sacrifice her to a demon. This escalated to the point where Geralt threatened to kill Yennefer in order to protect Ciri.\n\nNeedles to say this original storyline from Hissrich destroyed both Geralt and Yennefer - who were supposed to be each others love of their lives - and the storyline destroyed Ciri's and Yennefer's relationship.\n\nThis is just my personal opinion, but I have no faith in Lauren, to fix the mess she and her writing team have made. And the odds are, they will fail. Even though the season isn't out yet, we can see what they are capable of writing, and its called the Blood Origin spin-off. Which abandoned Sapkowski's books entirely."

        "body": "I see too many comments claiming Eva Green is 'too old' to be Yennefer, and that in the books she is described as 20 years old. The answer is NO. It's either a mistranslation or misconception that's been repeated so many times that people think it's true. Let me quote the original Polish description. Geralt about Yen:\n\n'Nadal patrzy\u0142. Mia\u0142a figur\u0119 dwudziestolatki, cho\u0107 jej prawdziwego wieku wola\u0142 nie zgadywa\u0107'\n\nThe correct translation is that she had a figure of a 20 years old, not face. In Polish language this is a reference to your body shape and fitness only, and absolutely nothing else!\n\nOn top of that, I want you all to ask yourself a question: How did you imagine the sorceresses while reading about the Thanedd banquet or meetings of the lodge? Did you imagine a bunch of girls who just finished high school and entered their 20s or women, older, in their 30s? If so, ask yourself why? Remember that a lot of them are 100+ years old. As you get older, you change and it's not just your body, but you also develop a taste, your character is different too. You become more refined and find elegance and class, or at least that's something that the sorceresses were. With certain character comes a specific look. In such a sophisticated environment, would you really choose to look like a child or more woman-like but still sexy? \n\nIn my opinion Eva Green is the only perfect casting. I could throw a few others, but she is just born to be Yennefer.\n\nEdit: Because some of you still don't understand: I made this post to bust the look myth, not to make a case for Eva to be in Netflix's shipwreck."

        "body": "1) Something Ends, Something Begins is a non-canon story. Sapkowski said he wrote it for his friends wedding. There is no difference between regular fanfic and SESB. The fact that Sapkowski wrote it doesn't change anything. Also, it's not an alternative ending for Witcher 3. Vasemir must be dead, but we can still see him in this story. It can't be an alternative ending for books too, because we know that at the end of the books Geralt and Yennefer died.\n\n2) ''Dear Eskel'' thing is not a sign of love. Remember Witcher 1, Chapter 4. Triss sent a letter to Geralt with Dandelion. Geralt has to answer back. The player was deciding whether to write a love letter or a friendship letter. If you choose a love letter, it starts with ''Beloved Triss'' but if you choose a friendship letter, it starts with ''Dear Triss''. Also, in real life or in the Witcher universe, I never see someone who calls her or his lover as a ''Dear''. ''Dear Eskel'' is a sign of their friendship.\n\n3) BoE and handkiss thing: Triss sensed magic. Simple. Again, at the beginning of The Witcher 1, she sensed Azar Javed's magic. She found Geralt in Chapter 3 because she sensed magical anomalies. She always detects magic in books. Using it as a love sign is the cheapest way. Eskel kissed her hand respectfully. When Triss felt magic (not love), she immediately pulled her hand back. This moment doesn't say anything; the fact that Triss felt a pleasant vibration doesn't mean that she likes someone.\n\n4) If Sapkowski liked the idea of Triss-Eskel, he would add clear hints. For example, we know Crach and Yennefer were ex-lovers. Sapkowski liked that idea and added clear hints about it. But in BoE and other books, there is no tiny hint about Triss and Eskel's possible relationship. He said it was a joke, and he was joking. Besides, we know the books are all about Triss's obsession with Geralt.\n\nYou guys probably know well that this ship doesn't have a place in canon. I didn't see anyone claim it's canon. I just wanted to explain it quickly.\n\nWell, now talk about the after-Witcher 3 timeline. Triss and Yennefer love Geralt. Thats clear. Don't come with a djinn or something like that. Both love Geralt. But I guarantee you that if Geralt chose Yennefer or Triss, the other one would never jump into a new relationship. Triss and Geralt broke up after Loc Muinne. She didn't jump into another relationship. She told Geralt how she is sad because they split up. Yennefer is not different. Yennefer and Geralt probably broke up many times. But Yennefer never jumped into a new relationship. So, if Geralt chooses Yen or Triss, the other person will never be happy in a new relationship. Many people are using this meaningless ship as a ''happy ending for everyone''. There is no happy ending for everyone. One woman will be so upset. Based on books and games, I can clearly say that.\n\nNow, check this: https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/12o1kvo/eskelyennefer/ First of all, I am not a freak. I know Eskel and Yennefer will never be together after Geralt chooses Triss. I know this ship is weird. I just wanted to learn Yen fans reactions. I am happy with the results. They hated it and downvoted it. Great. When Yen fans see this, their feelings are the same as my feelings when I see Triss-Eskel. For just a moment, they felt the same as us. Both ships don't have a place in canon, game canon. Making fanart, etc., hurts people who like those characters. It's meaningless.\n\nTriss-Eskel ship is weird, meanless like Yennefer-Eskel, Geralt-Zoltan, and Ciri-Vernon Roche.\n\nWell, we know CDPR did let everyone make their own fanship even though it was weird. (I wish they didn't, but anyway.) So, everybody is free. I am not saying don't make fanart or screenshots about those weird ships. Do it. But if you do it, you guys have to deal with a couple truths. Those ships are ridiculous and pointless. Also, sometimes it hurts people."

In the netflix show they are the primary antagonists aside from the wild hunt I suppose. \n\nAre the Nilfgaard war mongers or is it just their emperor that make them despised?  I remember something about they constantly killing off their own leaders.\n\n Is Cahir just a jerk? Yennifer definitely didnt want to be assigned to Nilfgaard intially. Yet she helps get him back to Cintra...why?\n\nAlso why does every other kingdom seem to want to conquer Cintra? Is it like the capital of the entire land mass or is it just the most fortified? largest army?\n\nWhat is it about Nilfgaard culture that seems to make them everyones enemy?\n\nSorry if these things seem obvious but with so much going on in the show, it really loses perspective."

        "body": "**\\*Disclaimer\\***\n\nThis is a LONG post so feel free to skim or just look at the pictures for your convenience.  (Also, forgive me if the formatting of this post is cumbersome, it's my first time trying something this big and thorough.  I'm very open to formatting suggestions for future faction reviews).\n\nAfter receiving quite a few questions about various aspects of the Gwent set that I purchased [(Gwent 2.0 by Novigrad Tavern)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/115726426191?hash=item1af1d5204f:g:O2kAAOSw-iljYTBJ), I figured that it might be nice to do a more thorough breakdown of the set for anyone who might be interested in acquiring a set of their own. No matter where you get it, physical Gwent sets can be quite an investment so I am writing these reviews to help anyone who would like a little more information before committing to such a big purchase.  These reviews are intended to show you the physical quality of each set as well as to provide insight on the balancing and real-world playability of these sets with friends.\n\nAs this particular set comes with 10 unique factions (5 classic \u2013 rebalanced and 5 new expansions) I will be reviewing two decks at a time. One expansion deck and one rebalanced classic. I am including many images of the card sets as well. I won\u2019t have images of the entire card set for every faction but I will have many. In some cases you will see all of the cards, in others, just the relevant changes and a few highlights.\n\nIf you have a particular pairing you would like me to review next, feel free to let me know. I plan to get to all 10 eventually but I will go in any order if you have a particular interest in some factions over others.\n\n**General Card Information**\n\nThe cards have a thickness of 300gsm which feels equivalent to the official 4 sets released by CD Projekt RED with the expansions of Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine (speaking as an owner). The text and image quality is sharp. Duplicate units such as those with Tight Bond abilities (i.e. Impera Brigade Guard) have been given unique artwork for each unit. On the Seller\u2019s page they indicate that they have sourced some artwork from internet sources \u2013 I\u2019ve heard that some came from the Gwent mobile game \u2013 as well as custom drew some artwork themselves.  There isn\u2019t a clear indication of which is which, however. With that said, all of the art works well together and there aren\u2019t any obvious dips in quality in either art or print.\n\nThe cards come only in Tarot size 61mm by 112mm. This is the same size as the official expansion sets.\n\n**Velen**\n\n**Faction Identity**\n\nThe theme of this deck is based around Velen\u2019s regional identity as a place of misery, death, and scavengers. As such, there are no overtly powerful units or heroes like you would find in the other factions with an average unit strength between 3 and 6 and only two units (one standard and one hero) reaching a power of 8. However, what this faction offers is the potential to trap, kill, and swarm in on the carcasses of other dead units.\n\n**Faction Mechanics**\n\n[Velen Faction Cards](https://preview.redd.it/ytnbjb6i5zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebbdeee2ae7e3f1251420627fb0fa2fc4ccd3337)\n\nThis regional theme is tied into the faction perk which doubles as its primary drawing mechanic. Any time a unit is killed on either side of the battlefield, you draw a card from the top of your deck and either (A. play it immediately) or (B. shuffle it back into your deck). This mechanic applies to both unit and special cards. What this does is discourage destruction effects from your opponents by effectively setting them at a card disadvantage as you are likely to immediately replace any of your destroyed units with another. The effect is compounded when you are the one to initiate destruction as you generally are gaining a +1 or +2 advantage.\n\n**Unique Faction Abilities**\n\n[Velen Special Cards](https://preview.redd.it/v6an87976zra1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcb2b682b78ab3101651bb8206f2a547688a5b81)\n\n*Soothsayer* \u2013 This effect is only found on three heroes and through the effect of one Leader. This is an additive ability that improves your faction perk of drawing and immediately playing a card from your deck when a unit is killed. While the unit with this effect is active on the field, when your faction perk is triggered, instead of drawing just one card and playing it immediately, you get to draw two cards and choose which card to play while the other is shuffled back into the deck. For each additional Soothsayer ability active on the field, you get to draw an additional card to choose from. For example, if your faction perk is triggered while you have 2 Soothsayers active, you get to draw 3 cards, choose which one to play and shuffle the remaining two back into the deck.\n\nThis ability allows you to more strategically benefit from your faction perk by limiting the RNG a bit. However, as this ability is specifically tied to heroes, it is not abusable through medics, or decoys. The unit strength is rather low as well (see photos) so this is geared more toward a particular deck build and win con.\n\n*Curse* \u2013 This is the most interesting of the new abilities. Curse is a special card unique to this faction that works as follows. You can place this card on any row on either player\u2019s battlefield. The next non-hero unit card played on this row will die immediately without triggering its effect.\n\nThis adds a lot of fun control and disruption strategy. With this card you can effectively negate spy plays by the opponent when you have an idea of what row they play on by cursing your own lanes. On the other side of the field, you can use curse to completely negate Muster/Companion plays or disrupt predictable combos from Tight Bond units or Transformations (Skellige Bears or Monsters of Toussaint). Curse forces your opponent to make choices they otherwise wouldn\u2019t which adds another level of depth to your strategy.\n\n*Bait \u2013* This is unique to one unit card \u201cAbandoned Girl.\u201d She has a power of 0 but when played, this allows you to search your deck for any one card with the Tight Bond ability and play it immediately. This card can be decoyed so it works very well as a combo starter or surprise power boost.\n\n*Execution* \\- Execution is exactly the same as Scorch, it just has big Velen energy.\n\n*General Ability Notes* \u2013 The seller of this deck decided to limit the quantity of weather cards from 3 each to two each for all factions to reduce \u201cweather spam.\u201d That\u2019s why you may notice fewer weather cards overall. This deck also includes only one spy \u201cJohnny\u201d which is a standard unit with a power of 3.\n\n**Notable Faction Leaders**\n\n[Velen Leader Cards](https://preview.redd.it/wsio5xvh6zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=197614c4999bc7bbf39e58b565edb3c22776fbab)\n\nEach Leader has an equally viable skill to use depending on your desired playstyle. Lady of the Wood Weavess allows you to draw from your deck and instantly play a Curse card while enhancing this particular Curse by giving it the ability to affect Hero cards.\n\nLady of the Wood Whispess plays into the control aspect of the deck. It allows you to designate one opponents row which, on their next turn, they must play a non-hero unit onto. If they cannot or choose not to, they must play a random card from their hand instead. This ability can be used twice per game but only once per round. Of the leader abilities, this has the most creative utility, however, in my experience, it hasn\u2019t been overpowered, as playing a random card tends to not as often have a severe consequence. Works very well in the mid to late game, however.\n\n**Faction Advantages and Disadvantages**\n\nThe Velen faction adds a little bit of a control mechanic to the game which, if you enjoy that in other TCGs, you may find very rewarding to play. With that said, it is not so controlling that it limits the opponent from playing the game effectively. It just forces them to strategize differently. Velen holds up very well against decks that rely too heavily on obvious plays and destruction effects such as Redania and Skellige.\n\nHowever, even with the draw mechanic, you are limited to using your perk based on the amount of destruction effects that occur so decks that avoid this will effectively limit you to the underpowered cards in your hand as your deck drawing ability is relegated to one spy, your decoys, and any of your own scorch effects. I have also found this deck to be weak against decks with a lot of lane flexibility such as Scoia\u2019tael.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty scrappy deck but its mechanics add a new and unique level to play strategy.\n\n[Velen Heroes](https://preview.redd.it/42rv40cp6zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ebbc807af2fa9cfb50cb9919cf05b3245430e9a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Velen Independent Units](https://preview.redd.it/ouxmhaas6zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec2277f2cb9ad5ba33b76fc3776789db21287cdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Velen Combo Units](https://preview.redd.it/68qza4rx6zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72be4ff2a327035acf1e7ca51a8dd04827c9f7b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nilfgaard**\n\nNilfgaard effectively functions more or less the same as it always has so I will only spend time covering some of the notable balance changes to the units, faction leaders, and abilities.\n\n**Faction Mechanics**\n\n[Nilfgaard Faction Card](https://preview.redd.it/nj20nb297zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=721d8f88218d4dd917065a426a5c8ddb8c648ffc)\n\nAnyone who knows Gwent knows that Nilfgaard lives and dies by its spies. It generates a lot of card advantage to make big plays with tight bond and high value units and heroes. That playstyle remains the same and it is still quite good at it. However, to prevent it from becoming too dominating, some changes have been made to lessen its power slightly while maintaining its win condition.\n\n**General Overview of Balance Changes**\n\n[Nilfgaard Spies and Emissaries](https://preview.redd.it/eu9xpfgd7zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2eb07c54ec677c9f9d80e7b76a3078e1a3dfcba)\n\n*Spies* \u2013 Instead of having all spies, Nilfgaard is now split between 3 Spies and 3 Emissaries. The power of spies have been raised (now 7, 8, and 9 - see photos) to increase the risk/reward aspect of playing them. This does impact decision-making somewhat but doesn\u2019t fundamentally change the way the deck is played. If your general strategy before was to give up the first round just playing spies to dominate the last two with card advantage, that strategy remains intact. However, using spies in later rounds becomes more of a gamble without a weather strategy. Emissaries are the lower-cost counterparts to spies that further balances the drawing mechanic which I will explain below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nilfgaard Selected Units and Heroes](https://preview.redd.it/pvgwn8qj7zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75f0bbd0c95f5deed3fc0bc8da11c1ca9df0cfd0)\n\n*Unit Strength* \u2013 The strength of some units has been lowered while others have increased and/or been given additional abilities. The Geralt and Princess Cirilla hero cards for instance have been lowered from power 15 to 12. Meanwhile Nilfgaard has received unit cards like Renuald aep Matsen which has a unique muster effect to reliably build tight bond chains.\n\n**Unique Faction Abilities**\n\n*Emissary* \u2013 While the Spies have had their power increased, Emissaries have taken the place of their lower-cost counterparts (see photos). Emissaries, are played the same as spies but they don\u2019t generate the same number of cards and instead offer some versatility and strategic combo options. When you play an Emissary you have the option to (A. draw 1 card from the top of your deck) or (B. look at the top 4 cards of your deck and place them back on the top or bottom of the deck in any order).\n\nSo the tradeoff of Emissaries being lower cost (4-5) is that you only get to draw one card. However, if you have multiple spies in hand, using an Emissary to arrange the top cards of your deck can more strategically set up your spies to draw into your other spies, big combo pieces, or critical special cards. Overall, this feels like a very organic balance that remains true to Nilfgaard\u2019s playstyle.\n\n*Renual aep Matsen* \u2013 This is a low power unit with a unique muster ability that allows you to search through your deck (from the bottom) until you find an Impera Brigade Guard. When you find it, you play it immediately, shuffle the cards you looked through and place them back at the bottom of the deck. This isn\u2019t a game changer by any means, but it adds a little more consistency to setting up the max Impera Brigade tight bond which is only boosted by the faction\u2019s drawing consistency.\n\n**Faction Leader Changes**\n\n[Photoshoot with Emhyr](https://preview.redd.it/vmj8owxp7zra1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a42b19772210e977bef9b172e43c66a9059dfea7)\n\nPreviously, in my experience, there was really only one leader ability used. The one which allowed you to draw a card from your opponent\u2019s discard pile. The leader abilities here have been totally revamped which gives you even more creative ways to play Nilfgaard and turn the tide at critical moments.\n\n*Emhyr: Conqueror of the North* \u2013 This allows you to look at 4 random cards in your opponent\u2019s hand, choose one, and force your opponent to play it on their next turn or otherwise pass the round. You can effectively force them into a bad play, ruin a combo, or pass the round prematurely. This a great disruption effect.\n\n*Emhyr: The White Flame* \u2013 This alters your spies and Emissaries by allowing you to choose whether you to draw cards from your own deck or your opponent's (though no more than 4 can be drawn from your opponent\u2019s deck the entire battle so there are no burn possibilities here, thankfully). The idea is fun to play around with but I haven\u2019t found it particularly game breaking. It does have the potential to screw up decks that rely on certain cards for combos like Wild Hunt and Skellige, but the real value I\u2019ve seen from it is taking a random faction-specific special card from an opposing deck.\n\n*Emhyr: The Relentless* \u2013 This allows you destroy one of your own cards to look at the top 4 cards of your deck, draw one, and put the other three back on the top or bottom in any order. This works really nicely for a standard Nilfgaard win condition.\n\n*Emhyr: King of Cintra* \u2013 This is the rebalanced version of his classic effect. Draw one unit (not a hero or special card) from the opponent\u2019s discard pile, then place one card from your hand on the bottom of your deck. It\u2019s more of a trade than instant advantage now.\n\n*Emhyr: Emperor of Nilfgaard* \u2013 Pick any one card from your opponent\u2019s discard pile (unit, hero, or special) they must play it immediately. Then you pick any one card from your own discard pile and play it immediately (this can\u2019t be used if opponent has no cards in their discard pile). I absolutely have the most fun with this leader skill. You can set up crazy disruption plays by forcing your opponent play weather at the wrong time, scorch their own units, etc. while you capitalize more effectively with your own resources.\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nThe biggest changes here are the Emissaries and the Leader skills which allow this faction to be more disruptive than you would expect. Although they toned down some of the power and limited the draw somewhat, Nilfgaard still plays true to how it always has and remains very competitive.\n\nOnce again, if you would like me to review any specific factions from this set next with photos, just let me know.\n\nThanks for reading (if you managed it)!"

        "body": "About The Witcher 3's ending, I appreciate that a great deal of ink has been spilled on this subreddit regarding how Dijkstra attempting to kill the Temerian Partisans in front of Geralt at the end of the \"Reason of State\" quest was an ill-advised and poorly conceived decision, but I wanted to point out another (more minor) plot issue with this quest.\n\nMore specifically, the idea that should one side with Dijkstra, he would somehow be able to seize the seat of Chancellor and rule over Redania himself. For context, by the time of the Witcher 3, Dijkstra is a former Redanian Spymaster turned criminal running an underground organisation in Novigrad. He has a large network of influence throughout the city's criminal underworld and presumably has some connections outside the city given his former career. \n\nWhilst Dijkstra ruling the north is presented as the better option compared to Emhyr and the mad king Radovid, it is not at all clear how Dijkstra would come to power over all of Redania and Kaedwen following Radovid's death. He does not even rule Novigrad itself let alone the rest of the North. Radovid V winning the war makes sense given that Nilfgaard are massively stretched logistically and he is depicted as a sound military tactician. Emhyr winning the war also makes sense given that Army Group Centre is 300,000 strong and is itching to break the stalemate as soon as an opportunity arises (such as Radovid being assassinated by any one of the countless internal enemies he has made for himself).\n\nBut for the Dijkstra ending to make sense, he would presumably need to go from controlling a contested underground criminal network in Novigrad, to somehow seizing political power in the city from Hierarch Hemmelfart (and the rest of the big four), to taking advantage of Redanian political chaos to perform a coup de'tat without an army, rolling up to the Redanian capital of Tretogor and somehow seizing the position of Chancellor despite no longer occupying a position within the Redanian government. And simultaneously convincing the Redanian army to accept this state of affairs, despite their own loyalty likely being split between their generals and now dead king. All of this would need to somehow happen within a few weeks to a month because as noted, the moment Field Marshal Havart var Moehoen gets word of Radovid's death, he is crossing the Pontar. And whilst Dijkstra would certainly make a competent chancellor and/or spy, he is not exactly famous for commanding armies (unlike Radovid who is the complete opposite).\n\nFurthermore, Vesemir's [narration of these events in the epilogue](https://youtu.be/D7KDR2QkSY4) does not make a whole lot of sense either. The epilogue just seems to hand wave the issue as well with \"Nilfgaard was defeated in the field whilst Radovid was assassinated.\" Don't get me wrong, an industrialised north under a competent and non-insane leader like Dijkstra sounds like the better of the three endings, but unless I have missed something big, it seems utterly unclear (to me at least) how this is in the realm of possibility. Especially when \"industrialisation and re-settlement\" would be a long-term policy and certainly wouldn't factor in when the Pontar stalemate breaks after Radovid's death."

I'm not sure where IGN gets 36 endings from.\n\nA very important event concerning the ending of the game can potentially be the war. As much as I have thought about it, I cannot imagine any scenario where Radovid lives to be one that is desirable. That degenerate needs to die.\n\nThe \"witcher\" ending seems to be unanimously agreed to be the \"best\" ending of the game, but the first time I played the game I didn't get that ending I got the Empress one and I kind of think that one MAY be the best for the North at least.\n\nAs Ciri says, she CAN make a positive difference in the world if she ascends to the throne after Nilfgaard wins the war. This is something that she cannot do if she is hunting drowners around forgotten villages, which makes a lot of sense to me. Ciri is a good person as we all know. If she does take the throne she will do what's right for the people. She'll never be a tyrant like Radovid. I know there is a lot more to ruling and that it is a complex thing, but Ciri being good is still a plus. Also, it seems like it really shouldn't matter, but her royal blood and lineage can make a big difference to things as a ruler. This is something that Dijkstra does not have.\n\nSo that begs the question of whether Nilfgaard taking over is acceptable. If they can be trusted to do what's best for the people. In the 3rd game, it's quite clear that everyone in the Northern Realms HATES Nilfgaard and honestly so does Geralt even if he doesn't show it that often. It's like the game tells you that the right thing to do is to hate Nilfgaard because they are the enemy. In at least the 3rd game, the Nilfgaardians, to me as someone who has never read the books, seem like somewhat reasonable people. Yes, they are invading force and that is not a good thing. They started the war unprovoked. Clearly they seek control because they have a high military strength. They push their weight around like bullies. This is all true. Clearly to all those who call the Northern Realms home, Nilfgaard seems like a clear enemy and that much is fair, but even with them being an enemy in the superficial sense, can this empire do what's right? That is the main question.\n\nSo what do you think? Can the Nilfgaardian Empire unite all the Northern Realms and bring peace and prosperity to the continent? I'd wager that with Ciri at the throne, they certainly can accomplish this but, if this is not the case, then I'm gonna have to say that the ending where Dijkstra takes over as Chancellor is the best one to me."

        "body": "So, I was wondering what exactly the difference between Sources and Elder Blood is. From my understanding Sources are born with great talent for magic and are overall very powerful. This amount of power however usually means that the Source will lack control which can end disastrous.\n\nThe Elder Blood seems to be the same - just even more powerful and even less controllable. Meaning Sources are generally speaking more powerful than \"regular\" mages but their power is uncontrollable and pales in comparison with the Elder Blood, right?\n\nMagic abilities are referred to as \"the Force\" or \"the power\" (Mages are Jedis confirmed!) [https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Power?so=search](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Power?so=search) Is the Elder Blood also connected to the same...energy (?) as \"regular\" magic? \n\nWhy exactly are Sorcerers and Sorceresses infertile? Looking at the books and games it seems to be because magic does some damage to the reproductive organs.  I believe Mother Nenneke says something to Yennefer along the lines of her ovaries being atrophied (sounds unpleasant and I don't even have those). \n\n\"*No one is born a wizard. We still know too little about genetics and the mechanisms of heredity. We sacrifice too little time and means on research. Unfortunately, we constantly try to pass on inherited magical abilities in, so to say, a natural way. Results of these pseudo-experiments can be seen all too often in town gutters and within temple walls. We see too many of them, and too frequently come across morons and women in catatonic state, dribbling seers who soil themselves, seeresses, village oracles and miracle-workers, cretins whose minds are degenerate due to the inherited, uncontrolled Force.*\n\n*These morons and cretins can also have offspring, can pass on abilities and this degenerate further. Is anyone in a position to foresee or describe how the last link in such a chain will look? Most of us wizards lose the ability to procreate due to somatic changes and dysfunction of the pituitary gland. Some wizards \u2014 usually women \u2014 attune to magic while still maintaining efficiency of the gonads. They can conceive and give birth \u2014 and have the audacity to consider this happiness and a blessing. But I repeat: no one is born a wizard. And no one should be born one! Conscious of the gravity of what I write, I answer the question posed at the Congress in Cidaris. I ask most emphatically: each one of us must decide what she wants to be \u2014 a wizard or a mother.*\n\n*I demand all apprentices be sterilised. Without exception.\"*\n\n\\- Tissaia de Vries: The poisoned Source ([https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The\\_Poisoned\\_Source?so=search](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Poisoned_Source?so=search))\n\nSo Sorcerers and Sorceresses can have children, but their children will be insane or stupid. But Tissaia seems to contradict herself here. She says that these lunatics have \"inherited, uncontrolled Force\". They ARE born with magic abilities but are degenerated and thus unable to use it, but technically they could be born wizards, despite Tissaia saying \"no one is born a wizard\". \n\nFurthermore: if magic itself makes you infertile in almost all cases and the offspring will be a rambling insane idiot then how could Geralts mother Visenna (a druidess/sorceress) give birth to him and he is nothing like that? \n\nNext point: how did the Elder Blood came to be? Was it mentioned and I missed it? And why is the active Lara-Gen only found in women? The Elder Blood is described as originating from Lara Dorren, the daughter of Auberon Muircetach, King of the Aen Elle. But how did Lara get it? And if the Elder Blood is a form of Magic then why can it be passed on normally without the people inheriting that gene being \"*morons and women in catatonic state, dribbling seers who soil themselves, seeresses, village oracles and miracle-workers, cretins whose minds are degenerate due to the inherited, uncontrolled Force\"?*\n\nIf Magic leaves you infertile due to being inherently destructive shouldn't the uncontrollable, far more powerful Elder Blood do the same to an even greater extent (as in doing more harm to the user, you can't be \"more infertile\" of course). Maybe even leading to the people inheriting it  being even more insane than the children of \"regular\" magic users.\n\nSources are said to be born with greater affinity for magic, but their gift is hard to control and they often suffer from mental illness or become mad in some way due to their gift being hard to control. As we can see from Pavetta and Ciri is the Elder Blood more powerful and more difficult to control. If the people inheriting it still don't suffer these side effects that would make it the only form of Magic (or \"Power\", \"Force\" whatever) that not only not makes you infertile but is also safe to inherit for your offspring since it does not leave you a rambling madman with a severe lack of intelligence.\n\n[https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Source?so=search](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Source?so=search)\n\nPhew, that was a long post, sorry about that. But I am really curious since I read the books many years ago and played the games several times but still have these questions in my head."

Now obviously the Witcher series happened because Netflix needed it's own GoT but they ignored the fact that GoT ran for over 8 years before ANY spinoff was made. I think it's just too soon for Blood Origin because you needed audiences to be invested in GoT before doing a spinoff. We're not at that point with the Witcher series as yet, assuming we ever get there.\n\nFans over the years have underplayed the work CDPR did with the Witcher game adaptation and overestimated or at least romanticized how beloved the witcher novels are, the reality is they do not have a similar prestige as GoT. I'm not trying to hate on what anyone likes but that's just the reality. The reason why that is relevant is because it affects public perception and interest in these series and I don't think we're at the point yet where casual viewers care enough about the Witcher overall to watch spin-offs. Netflix needs to slow down and focus on the main series. In fact, the budget used for this spinoff could have been better utilized for the main series. I don't expect it to look as good as Rings of Power but there's clearly work there that needs to be done. Blood Origin was decent but it just wasn't needed at this point.\n\nEdit: If you're just here to talk crap about the showrunner, don't waste your time. I don't know if that's what the subreddit has been reduced to but I'm only interested in discussing the series as it is not whatever fantasy adaptation ppl are still upset about after several years. It's past time people moved on from that."

I replayed Witcher 3 after the next-gen update went live earlier this month and finally decided to watch the series on Netflix. \n\nFull context, I haven't read the books. One video game is the only Witcher knowledge I have going into the show. Having said that, the two seasons got me hooked. So, why the strong dislike towards the series? I have read that the writers are departing from the original content, but that's the meaning of an \"adaptation\". The Lord of the Rings movies & books are different too, but both are enjoyable. If people want the exact same thing as the books, they exist for a reason. \n\nI know with Cavill's departure, the show might lose some excitement but I am really loving it for now. I cannot wait for season 3 & hope that this show completes its seven-season arc."

        "body": "After watching Blood Origin I think Netflix is facing a similar situation that we see over at DC presently where they are trying to play catch up instead of going at their own pace. **Everything feels Rushed**. Now obviously the Witcher series happened because Netflix needed it's own GoT but they ignored the fact that GoT ran for over 8 years before ANY spinoff was made. I think it's just too soon for Blood Origin because you needed audiences to be invested in GoT before doing a spinoff. We're not at that point with the Witcher series as yet, assuming we ever get there.\n\nFans over the years have underplayed the work CDPR did with the Witcher game adaptation and overestimated or at least romanticized how beloved the witcher novels are, the reality is they do not have a similar prestige as GoT. I'm not trying to hate on what anyone likes but that's just the reality. The reason why that is relevant is because it affects public perception and interest in these series and I don't think we're at the point yet where casual viewers care enough about the Witcher overall to watch spin-offs. Netflix needs to slow down and focus on the main series. In fact, the budget used for this spinoff could have been better utilized for the main series. I don't expect it to look as good as Rings of Power but there's clearly work there that needs to be done. Blood Origin was decent but it just wasn't needed at this point.\n\nEdit: If you're just here to talk crap about the showrunner, don't waste your time. I don't know if that's what the subreddit has been reduced to but I'm only interested in discussing the series as it is not whatever fantasy adaptation ppl are still upset about after several years. It's past time people moved on from that."

I replayed Witcher 3 after the next-gen update went live earlier this month and finally decided to watch the series on Netflix. \n\nFull context, I haven't read the books. One video game is the only Witcher knowledge I have going into the show. Having said that, the two seasons got me hooked. So, why the strong dislike towards the series? I have read that the writers are departing from the original content, but that's the meaning of an \"adaptation\". The Lord of the Rings movies & books are different too, but both are enjoyable. If people want the exact same thing as the books, they exist for a reason. \n\nI know with Cavill's departure, the show might lose some excitement but I am really loving it for now. I cannot wait for season 3 & hope that this show completes its seven-season arc."

So much.\n\nGo no further if y'all ain't into speculation and misery.\n\nI ask you, what does Radovid have in common with one of Jaskier's book cannon love interests? Not the flings, mind you, but the serious stuff. \n\nHe's *royalty* and therefore incredibly dangerous to the bard who doesn't believe he's made for monogamy.\n\nY'all.\n\nI think these jackasses plan to axe the part of the book that takes place in Toussaint. No Anna Henrietta, cause Radovid can easily occupy her role and deliver the consequences she did (nearly killing Jaskier). At least Fringilla Vigo's casting make sense now...seems they won't be having her honey pot Geralt so there's no need for her to look like Yennefer's actress. While I admit that bit of the books is *incredibly* frustrating this seems beyond the pale. I really hope I'm wrong... \n\nWill they go to Toussaint at all? I can't see a reason for it if I'm right."

At the beginning it was a bit difficult for me to understand how his friendship dynamics with Geralt worked if it seems that he can't wait to escape to the nearest path, however they give us small interactions with friendly vibes\n\n\n\n\nthen it's like everything goes the other way completely, (and here I have to apologize because I felt the show made geralt's scene on the mountain so unnecessary and made him look like an insensitive jerk along the way), but, It's like the creators couldn't find a way to get the character off of him (seeing as how other characters ignore him whenever they're in a group unless he's jerking around and being mean on purpose)\n\n\n\n\n\nso here's my question, does geralt really hate jaskier in the books or in the video games?  because it seems that his friendship is built on nothing and that makes him automatically excluded from any plot where other characters are involved unless he is a minor support even though he has done some actions to help in his own way and so far in the show It seems that even Yennefer is the only one who seems to have a sense of some camaraderie.\n\n\n\n\nand with the news about him that I've seen recently it seems that the creators are upping their ante in having the character finally do something that justifies the core triad of characters (ie Yennefer/Ciri/Geralt) leaving him still side completely and they can finally be the happy family they want to sell us (despite how questionable Yennefer's actions/motivations seem and how I feel like Geralt has lost his last brain cell in a way that confuses me)\n\n\n\n\nI ask this because so far, I feel that there is a certain strange nonsense in the series' relationships in terms of motivations/actions, at least in matters of logic."

I also really like the show and am excited for the next season.\n\nI understand book purist mindset since the books are so great why deviate from them? This got me thinking about the end of Time of Contempt, because by and large that's the least liked part of the series. For those who know or don't mind spoilers at the end of Time of Contempt Ciri \"falls in\"  with a pack of bandits after helping one escape with her from some bounty hunters. The one she helped out goes on to try to rape her, but is stopped by one of the gang: Mistle. After doing this Mistle promptly proceeds to basically do the same thing and succeeds and from there she and Ciri are in a very weird relationship. \n\nNow this is gross and wrong, but I get it. It's calling out the \"good guy\" Prince Charming trope where the \"nice guy\" saves the princess from Rape and then is entitled to sex with said princess. Sapkowski just switches out the Prince for a rogue of a woman and can then call out the hypocrisy of those who like (or want to be) Prince Charming. Still, that's the part I tend to read over when going through the books. Read it once, don't need to again.\n\nSo I'm curious how the show will handle it and how book purists will feel about it. The book story of Cahir >!washing Ciri after capturing her!< was changed in season 1, but that makes sense given the fact the show needed to show Ciri escape Cahir whereas the books could wait on that detail. I suspect it will be changed from the book, but Laura has said Time of Contempt is her favourite of the books so maybe she'll keep that bit. I don't know. What do you think?"

        "body": "I think I got into the Witcher's story the *opposite* way so many others did:\n\n1. I watched the Netflix TV shows Season 1 and 2 first\n2. I played The Witcher III: Wild Hunt (and all its DLCs) second\n3. I only *just* finished reading the Witcher books (all eight of them back to back)\n\nAnd I have to say: the Witcher books were a little bit of a letdown for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there was A LOT to love:\n\n**The clever writing.** The author has a really fun tongue-in-cheek way of describing many things--from sex to jokes to the way people die both on and off screen--that feels very clever. There were plenty of times that I was pleasantly surprised by how neatly certain story elements were wrapped up or the way they played out. (Case in point, the aguara storyline in *Season of Storms.)*\n\n**The way it makes you think.** Interestingly enough, it wasn't the philosophical conversations that made me thoughtful. More than once, I found myself burning through a chapter or scene, only to have to go back and re-read something that was left carefully and deliberately vague, or which was explained only *just* enough to make you draw your own conclusions. \n\n**The world.** There's no denying the world of the Witcher is brilliantly rich, colorful, dark, gritty, and filled with countless fascinating details. Every city felt so utterly unique and compelling, every village and hamlet had its own quirks. Honestly, some of the best and most enjoyable world-building I've read.\n\n**The characters.** Dandelion is a delight. Zoltan Chivay was a wonderful altruist. Regis was a surprise. Yennefer's \"dear friend\" letter had me howling with laughter. So many of the characters who appeared in the series were just so much fun to read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I did have a hard time with a few things:\n\n**The storytelling.** As much fun as it was to read Geralt's stories, more often than not it felt like Geralt's *wanderings.* Though the author made a point of having a character explain that Geralt was traveling to travel and not reach a certain destination, they didn't use his wanderings to tell a specific story or play to a theme. Case in point, Baptism of Fire. The book is clearly used to illustrate the aftermath of a war and its effects on the people who suffer most. But there was no cohesive through-line or story \"circle\" that was closed by the end. It felt like like a proper book (with start, middle, and end) and more like the collection of short stories like in *The Last Wish* or *Sword of Destiny.* \n\nI'll admit this could be simply that storytelling in Poland is done differently than in Western literature. This is very much the case with Japanese manga/anime, Korean/K-drama, and Latin American novelas. We who read a lot of \"Western literature\" are used to things like the Three Act Structure, the Hero's Journey, and other structural elements that make a story feel \"right\". When books diverge from that structure, it can sometimes feel off.\n\n**The lack of monsters.** The combat of *The Witcher III: Wild Hunt* was almost as much of a highlight for me as the Gwent card game. I particularly loved how Geralt had to approach combat with each monster in a specific way, with specific tactics and even weaponry. \n\nThe books were attempting to show that the \"neutrality of witchers\" was untenable, that they couldn't absent themselves from the world's strifes by turning a blind eye, hence the focus on the *human* enemies. But I did find myself wishing for more demonstrations of Geralt's approach to and knowledge of various monsters. It would fit more in line with the Witcher we got in both the game and TV show (which, I acknowledge, are very different forms of media than books).\n\n**The character development.** There were minor changes in some of the characters: Geralt and his morality, Ciri and her evolution, even Yennefer and her becoming more maternal toward Ciri and her relationship with Geralt. \n\nBut for the most part, they and the rest of the characters felt largely static. Don't get me wrong, they were very well-crafted and three-dimensional. Yet they remained the same for as long as they remained in the story. No one evolved or changed, they just continued on the way they were, driven by their own hopes, dreams, and desires and only *slightly* adapted by the world around them. But there was far less character development, even for the main characters, than I'd have wished. \n\nAgain, this could simply be a different approach to storytelling than I'm accustomed to. Or, perhaps, that's what the author was trying to do with the story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will close this by saying that I read each of the books back to back, and burned through the series as quickly as I could because...well, it's the Witcher! But had I not been so engaged by the game (I got HOOKED HARD!) and the TV show (Henry Cavill nailed it), I might not have continued.\n\nSo if I had to rate the Witcher in all his forms of media:\n\n* **The games** are the best depiction, by a LANDSLIDE.\n* **The books** tell a more complex story with greater focus on the politics and the world at large, but the **TV series** depicts characters that are far more engaging and compelling."

You can't practically call the season an adaptation of the books, most of the story was invented and filler and contradicts the plot of the books, if they thought that a single book does not have enough plot for a single season they could have then adapted two books in season 2. They also made up a whole story of Ciri summoning monsters and some obelisks and various other plots, how they turned Francesca and Fringilla into completely different characters that bear no resemblance to the ones in the books, with different personalities and backstories, the Yennefer's actress is good, as are several other actors in the series, but she spent the entire season on an invented plot and I don't know how they will fix her relationship with Ciri, in which both see each other as mother and daughter after she tried kill her (!!!).\n\nRings of Power was also a horrible adaptation, I know it would be difficult to create a story in the Second Age, but the story they created was not good. They for some reason put Isildur together with Celebrimbor at the same time. In an interview, they said that if they followed the books they would have to change the human characters every season, but they could have at least simplified the series then to have just two different periods, the first seasons with the creation of the rings of power plot and then midway through the series, after season 2/3, a timeskip with a new human cast. So you could show the prime of Numenor and then the corrupted version of it and just do a single human cast change. So it would show the passage of time and they would only have two sets of human characters, now they would have to put all the events of the second era in a few years.\n\nAnd they did what most people wanted to be the plot of an entire season, the creation of the rings of Celebrimbor, in a single episode (!!!) for some reason, and they cut pretty much the whole relationship between Sauron and Celebrimbor , which is one of the most important, complex and explored relationships in the books, practically does not exist in the series, all the friendship between them, Sauron convincing him to create the rings and ignore Celeborn and Galadriel's warnings, the fact that they together have become become the most important people in Eregion, how it seems that they traded the most important relationship that was between Sauron and Celebrimbor for Sauron and Galadriel, all their dynamics and relationships that could be explored and developed, the whole history of politics in Eregion that could have lasted one season and be important for the next seasons, I feel that it was cut, less than one episode, why those responsible for the series preferred to invent a relationship between Sauron and Galadriel for some reason (and it is because of them being a woman and a man?).\n\nBut in fact the series had other problems, as it seemed that the plots were very slow and did not move, the best and most fun plot of the series was Celebrimbor with the dwarves. In addition, the whole plot of the Southlands was horrible, all the people who lived in the region called it that, it did not have a name of its own, in addition to the fact that it had no scale, after the village where they lived was attacked by Orcs and the population fled and met in a tiny tavern, they talk to all the survivors in the region (!!!) and then meet with the army of Numenor, the Kingdom seemed tiny.\n\nAnd finally Wheel of Time, the series was not perfect and had several problems, but it was a good adaptation and watching the series it can be seen that those responsible read and knew the books intimately, several (but not all) modifications can be explained to summarize the plot of the books to have the first season only 8 episodes and the series to have in total only between six and eight seasons, because different from the previous series these books are huge, in addition to several of the modifications in the first episodes and in the last episodes were why Amazon told them to cut the first episode in half (it originally would have been two hours) and there was a break of months before the filming of the last episodes because of the coronavirus, where they they lost an actor in this break (Mat) and they had that completely change the footage of the final battle against the Trollocs. Of course the series had problems, as for example Rand was less prominent than necessary for most of the season. So this first season was just ok, but it was a good and relatively faithful adaptation to the books."

        "body": "I think I got into the Witcher's story the *opposite* way so many others did:\n\n1. I watched the Netflix TV shows Season 1 and 2 first\n2. I played The Witcher III: Wild Hunt (and all its DLCs) second\n3. I only *just* finished reading the Witcher books (all eight of them back to back)\n\nAnd I have to say: the Witcher books were a little bit of a letdown for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there was A LOT to love:\n\n**The clever writing.** The author has a really fun tongue-in-cheek way of describing many things--from sex to jokes to the way people die both on and off screen--that feels very clever. There were plenty of times that I was pleasantly surprised by how neatly certain story elements were wrapped up or the way they played out. (Case in point, the aguara storyline in *Season of Storms.)*\n\n**The way it makes you think.** Interestingly enough, it wasn't the philosophical conversations that made me thoughtful. More than once, I found myself burning through a chapter or scene, only to have to go back and re-read something that was left carefully and deliberately vague, or which was explained only *just* enough to make you draw your own conclusions. \n\n**The world.** There's no denying the world of the Witcher is brilliantly rich, colorful, dark, gritty, and filled with countless fascinating details. Every city felt so utterly unique and compelling, every village and hamlet had its own quirks. Honestly, some of the best and most enjoyable world-building I've read.\n\n**The characters.** Dandelion is a delight. Zoltan Chivay was a wonderful altruist. Regis was a surprise. Yennefer's \"dear friend\" letter had me howling with laughter. So many of the characters who appeared in the series were just so much fun to read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I did have a hard time with a few things:\n\n**The storytelling.** As much fun as it was to read Geralt's stories, more often than not it felt like Geralt's *wanderings.* Though the author made a point of having a character explain that Geralt was traveling to travel and not reach a certain destination, they didn't use his wanderings to tell a specific story or play to a theme. Case in point, Baptism of Fire. The book is clearly used to illustrate the aftermath of a war and its effects on the people who suffer most. But there was no cohesive through-line or story \"circle\" that was closed by the end. It felt like like a proper book (with start, middle, and end) and more like the collection of short stories like in *The Last Wish* or *Sword of Destiny.* \n\nI'll admit this could be simply that storytelling in Poland is done differently than in Western literature. This is very much the case with Japanese manga/anime, Korean/K-drama, and Latin American novelas. We who read a lot of \"Western literature\" are used to things like the Three Act Structure, the Hero's Journey, and other structural elements that make a story feel \"right\". When books diverge from that structure, it can sometimes feel off.\n\n**The lack of monsters.** The combat of *The Witcher III: Wild Hunt* was almost as much of a highlight for me as the Gwent card game. I particularly loved how Geralt had to approach combat with each monster in a specific way, with specific tactics and even weaponry. \n\nThe books were attempting to show that the \"neutrality of witchers\" was untenable, that they couldn't absent themselves from the world's strifes by turning a blind eye, hence the focus on the *human* enemies. But I did find myself wishing for more demonstrations of Geralt's approach to and knowledge of various monsters. It would fit more in line with the Witcher we got in both the game and TV show (which, I acknowledge, are very different forms of media than books).\n\n**The character development.** There were minor changes in some of the characters: Geralt and his morality, Ciri and her evolution, even Yennefer and her becoming more maternal toward Ciri and her relationship with Geralt. \n\nBut for the most part, they and the rest of the characters felt largely static. Don't get me wrong, they were very well-crafted and three-dimensional. Yet they remained the same for as long as they remained in the story. No one evolved or changed, they just continued on the way they were, driven by their own hopes, dreams, and desires and only *slightly* adapted by the world around them. But there was far less character development, even for the main characters, than I'd have wished. \n\nAgain, this could simply be a different approach to storytelling than I'm accustomed to. Or, perhaps, that's what the author was trying to do with the story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will close this by saying that I read each of the books back to back, and burned through the series as quickly as I could because...well, it's the Witcher! But had I not been so engaged by the game (I got HOOKED HARD!) and the TV show (Henry Cavill nailed it), I might not have continued.\n\nSo if I had to rate the Witcher in all his forms of media:\n\n* **The games** are the best depiction, by a LANDSLIDE.\n* **The books** tell a more complex story with greater focus on the politics and the world at large, but the **TV series** depicts characters that are far more engaging and compelling."

        "body": "I wanted to start the games, but a friend recommended me to read the books first. Around two years ago I read the last wish and I remember enjoying it but sometimes it was hard to understand some sentences (my english is not perfect, but from what I've heard the translation is not great either). I don't reallly remember much and I was thinking of reading that book again and the rest of the saga.\n\nThe \"problem\" is a lot of people say that the books are pretty average/bad and another part seems to love them. I wanted to ask for the opinions of the people on this sub, is it worth spending a lot of time reading the saga? Sadly I don't have that much spare time since I'm a college student atm so I wanted to know if it was worth it to dedicate myself to reading them and after that playing the games.\n\nsorry for the long post and thanks :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbtw in case you recommend the books, should I search for any specific translation?\n\n\nEdit: thank you so much for the comments, I think for now I will read the first book of short stories, see if I like it and maybe read the second book of short stories and I will decide later but probably stop there.\nOnce again thank you for all the opinion you gave me , it helped a lot"

        "body": " I've been wanting to create this post for months but I never did. I decided to create it now, because even many months later I am still surprised that this series was much better and more faithful than the other two.\n\nWitcher should be an easy adaptation, it has the short stories and then the story, which is actually simple and not very thick books, but the second season of the Netflix series was horrible! You can't practically call the season an adaptation of the books, most of the story was invented and filler and contradicts the plot of the books, if they thought that a single book does not have enough plot for a single season they could have then adapted two books in season 2. They also made up a whole story of Ciri summoning monsters and some obelisks and various other plots, how they turned Francesca and Fringilla into completely different characters that bear no resemblance to the ones in the books, with different personalities and backstories, the Yennefer's actress is good, as are several other actors in the series, but she spent the entire season on an invented plot and I don't know how they will fix her relationship with Ciri, in which both see each other as mother and daughter after she tried kill her (!!!).\n\nRings of Power was also a horrible adaptation, I know it would be difficult to create a story in the Second Age, but the story they created was not good. They for some reason put Isildur together with Celebrimbor at the same time. In an interview, they said that if they followed the books they would have to change the human characters every season, but they could have at least simplified the series then to have just two different periods, the first seasons with the creation of the rings of power plot and then midway through the series, after season 2/3, a timeskip with a new human cast. So you could show the prime of Numenor and then the corrupted version of it and just do a single human cast change. So it would show the passage of time and they would only have two sets of human characters, now they would have to put all the events of the second era in a few years.\n\nAnd they did what most people wanted to be the plot of an entire season, the creation of the rings of Celebrimbor, in a single episode (!!!) for some reason, and they cut pretty much the whole relationship between Sauron and Celebrimbor , which is one of the most important, complex and explored relationships in the books, practically does not exist in the series, all the friendship between them, Sauron convincing him to create the rings and ignore Celeborn and Galadriel's warnings, the fact that they together have become become the most important people in Eregion, how it seems that they traded the most important relationship that was between Sauron and Celebrimbor for Sauron and Galadriel, all their dynamics and relationships that could be explored and developed, the whole history of politics in Eregion that could have lasted one season and be important for the next seasons, I feel that it was cut, less than one episode, why those responsible for the series preferred to invent a relationship between Sauron and Galadriel for some reason (and it is because of them being a woman and a man?).\n\nBut in fact the series had other problems, as it seemed that the plots were very slow and did not move, the best and most fun plot of the series was Celebrimbor with the dwarves. In addition, the whole plot of the Southlands was horrible, all the people who lived in the region called it that, it did not have a name of its own, in addition to the fact that it had no scale, after the village where they lived was attacked by Orcs and the population fled and met in a tiny tavern, they talk to all the survivors in the region (!!!) and then meet with the army of Numenor, the Kingdom seemed tiny.\n\nAnd finally Wheel of Time, the series was not perfect and had several problems, but it was a good adaptation and watching the series it can be seen that those responsible read and knew the books intimately, several (but not all) modifications can be explained to summarize the plot of the books to have the first season only 8 episodes and the series to have in total only between six and eight seasons, because different from the previous series these books are huge, in addition to several of the modifications in the first episodes and in the last episodes were why Amazon told them to cut the first episode in half (it originally would have been two hours) and there was a break of months before the filming of the last episodes because of the coronavirus, where they they lost an actor in this break (Mat) and they had that completely change the footage of the final battle against the Trollocs. Of course the series had problems, as for example Rand was less prominent than necessary for most of the season. So this first season was just ok, but it was a good and relatively faithful adaptation to the books."

I played The Witcher III: Wild Hunt (and all its DLCs) second\n3. I only *just* finished reading the Witcher books (all eight of them back to back)\n\nAnd I have to say: the Witcher books were a little bit of a letdown for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there was A LOT to love:\n\n**The clever writing.** The author has a really fun tongue-in-cheek way of describing many things--from sex to jokes to the way people die both on and off screen--that feels very clever. There were plenty of times that I was pleasantly surprised by how neatly certain story elements were wrapped up or the way they played out. (Case in point, the aguara storyline in *Season of Storms.)*\n\n**The way it makes you think.** Interestingly enough, it wasn't the philosophical conversations that made me thoughtful. More than once, I found myself burning through a chapter or scene, only to have to go back and re-read something that was left carefully and deliberately vague, or which was explained only *just* enough to make you draw your own conclusions. \n\n**The world.** There's no denying the world of the Witcher is brilliantly rich, colorful, dark, gritty, and filled with countless fascinating details. Every city felt so utterly unique and compelling, every village and hamlet had its own quirks. Honestly, some of the best and most enjoyable world-building I've read.\n\n**The characters.** Dandelion is a delight. Zoltan Chivay was a wonderful altruist. Regis was a surprise. Yennefer's \"dear friend\" letter had me howling with laughter. So many of the characters who appeared in the series were just so much fun to read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I did have a hard time with a few things:\n\n**The storytelling.** As much fun as it was to read Geralt's stories, more often than not it felt like Geralt's *wanderings.* Though the author made a point of having a character explain that Geralt was traveling to travel and not reach a certain destination, they didn't use his wanderings to tell a specific story or play to a theme. Case in point, Baptism of Fire. The book is clearly used to illustrate the aftermath of a war and its effects on the people who suffer most. But there was no cohesive through-line or story \"circle\" that was closed by the end. It felt like like a proper book (with start, middle, and end) and more like the collection of short stories like in *The Last Wish* or *Sword of Destiny.* \n\nI'll admit this could be simply that storytelling in Poland is done differently than in Western literature. This is very much the case with Japanese manga/anime, Korean/K-drama, and Latin American novelas. We who read a lot of \"Western literature\" are used to things like the Three Act Structure, the Hero's Journey, and other structural elements that make a story feel \"right\". When books diverge from that structure, it can sometimes feel off.\n\n**The lack of monsters.** The combat of *The Witcher III: Wild Hunt* was almost as much of a highlight for me as the Gwent card game. I particularly loved how Geralt had to approach combat with each monster in a specific way, with specific tactics and even weaponry. \n\nThe books were attempting to show that the \"neutrality of witchers\" was untenable, that they couldn't absent themselves from the world's strifes by turning a blind eye, hence the focus on the *human* enemies. But I did find myself wishing for more demonstrations of Geralt's approach to and knowledge of various monsters. It would fit more in line with the Witcher we got in both the game and TV show (which, I acknowledge, are very different forms of media than books).\n\n**The character development.** There were minor changes in some of the characters: Geralt and his morality, Ciri and her evolution, even Yennefer and her becoming more maternal toward Ciri and her relationship with Geralt. \n\nBut for the most part, they and the rest of the characters felt largely static. Don't get me wrong, they were very well-crafted and three-dimensional. Yet they remained the same for as long as they remained in the story. No one evolved or changed, they just continued on the way they were, driven by their own hopes, dreams, and desires and only *slightly* adapted by the world around them. But there was far less character development, even for the main characters, than I'd have wished. \n\nAgain, this could simply be a different approach to storytelling than I'm accustomed to. Or, perhaps, that's what the author was trying to do with the story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will close this by saying that I read each of the books back to back, and burned through the series as quickly as I could because...well, it's the Witcher! But had I not been so engaged by the game (I got HOOKED HARD!) and the TV show (Henry Cavill nailed it), I might not have continued.\n\nSo if I had to rate the Witcher in all his forms of media:\n\n* **The games** are the best depiction, by a LANDSLIDE.\n* **The books** tell a more complex story with greater focus on the politics and the world at large, but the **TV series** depicts characters that are far more engaging and compelling."

There's a lot of great things about them including the blending of science and biology with fantasy and some not so great things including the objectifying of female characters. But at it's very heart it is the story of a sterile mutant man who adopts a daughter that can jump universes, bringing him closer to his on and off sterile witch girlfriend and whom he fights to be reunited with after being separated.\n\nI like how Andrzej Sapkowski writes Ciri. She is curious, stubborn and insecure but grows into a confident and powerful woman after some VERY horrible experiences. (The ice skating part is so badass.) She is the last person who is trained at Kaer Moren and I think she is the main protagonist of the books. She is \"The Witcher\".\n\nWhat do the fantasy community think?"

I don't reallly remember much and I was thinking of reading that book again and the rest of the saga.\n\nThe \"problem\" is a lot of people say that the books are pretty average/bad and another part seems to love them. I wanted to ask for the opinions of the people on this sub, is it worth spending a lot of time reading the saga?

        "body": " I've been wanting to create this post for months but I never did. I decided to create it now, because even many months later I am still surprised that this series was much better and more faithful than the other two.\n\nWitcher should be an easy adaptation, it has the short stories and then the story, which is actually simple and not very thick books, but the second season of the Netflix series was horrible! You can't practically call the season an adaptation of the books, most of the story was invented and filler and contradicts the plot of the books, if they thought that a single book does not have enough plot for a single season they could have then adapted two books in season 2. They also made up a whole story of Ciri summoning monsters and some obelisks and various other plots, how they turned Francesca and Fringilla into completely different characters that bear no resemblance to the ones in the books, with different personalities and backstories, the Yennefer's actress is good, as are several other actors in the series, but she spent the entire season on an invented plot and I don't know how they will fix her relationship with Ciri, in which both see each other as mother and daughter after she tried kill her (!!!).\n\nRings of Power was also a horrible adaptation, I know it would be difficult to create a story in the Second Age, but the story they created was not good. They for some reason put Isildur together with Celebrimbor at the same time. In an interview, they said that if they followed the books they would have to change the human characters every season, but they could have at least simplified the series then to have just two different periods, the first seasons with the creation of the rings of power plot and then midway through the series, after season 2/3, a timeskip with a new human cast. So you could show the prime of Numenor and then the corrupted version of it and just do a single human cast change. So it would show the passage of time and they would only have two sets of human characters, now they would have to put all the events of the second era in a few years.\n\nAnd they did what most people wanted to be the plot of an entire season, the creation of the rings of Celebrimbor, in a single episode (!!!) for some reason, and they cut pretty much the whole relationship between Sauron and Celebrimbor , which is one of the most important, complex and explored relationships in the books, practically does not exist in the series, all the friendship between them, Sauron convincing him to create the rings and ignore Celeborn and Galadriel's warnings, the fact that they together have become become the most important people in Eregion, how it seems that they traded the most important relationship that was between Sauron and Celebrimbor for Sauron and Galadriel, all their dynamics and relationships that could be explored and developed, the whole history of politics in Eregion that could have lasted one season and be important for the next seasons, I feel that it was cut, less than one episode, why those responsible for the series preferred to invent a relationship between Sauron and Galadriel for some reason (and it is because of them being a woman and a man?).\n\nBut in fact the series had other problems, as it seemed that the plots were very slow and did not move, the best and most fun plot of the series was Celebrimbor with the dwarves. In addition, the whole plot of the Southlands was horrible, all the people who lived in the region called it that, it did not have a name of its own, in addition to the fact that it had no scale, after the village where they lived was attacked by Orcs and the population fled and met in a tiny tavern, they talk to all the survivors in the region (!!!) and then meet with the army of Numenor, the Kingdom seemed tiny.\n\nAnd finally Wheel of Time, the series was not perfect and had several problems, but it was a good adaptation and watching the series it can be seen that those responsible read and knew the books intimately, several (but not all) modifications can be explained to summarize the plot of the books to have the first season only 8 episodes and the series to have in total only between six and eight seasons, because different from the previous series these books are huge, in addition to several of the modifications in the first episodes and in the last episodes were why Amazon told them to cut the first episode in half (it originally would have been two hours) and there was a break of months before the filming of the last episodes because of the coronavirus, where they they lost an actor in this break (Mat) and they had that completely change the footage of the final battle against the Trollocs. Of course the series had problems, as for example Rand was less prominent than necessary for most of the season. So this first season was just ok, but it was a good and relatively faithful adaptation to the books."

There's a lot of great things about them including the blending of science and biology with fantasy and some not so great things including the objectifying of female characters. But at it's very heart it is the story of a sterile mutant man who adopts a daughter that can jump universes, bringing him closer to his on and off sterile witch girlfriend and whom he fights to be reunited with after being separated.\n\nI like how Andrzej Sapkowski writes Ciri. She is curious, stubborn and insecure but grows into a confident and powerful woman after some VERY horrible experiences. (The ice skating part is so badass.) She is the last person who is trained at Kaer Moren and I think she is the main protagonist of the books. She is \"The Witcher\".\n\nWhat do the fantasy community think?"

        "body": "I think I got into the Witcher's story the *opposite* way so many others did:\n\n1. I watched the Netflix TV shows Season 1 and 2 first\n2. I played The Witcher III: Wild Hunt (and all its DLCs) second\n3. I only *just* finished reading the Witcher books (all eight of them back to back)\n\nAnd I have to say: the Witcher books were a little bit of a letdown for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there was A LOT to love:\n\n**The clever writing.** The author has a really fun tongue-in-cheek way of describing many things--from sex to jokes to the way people die both on and off screen--that feels very clever. There were plenty of times that I was pleasantly surprised by how neatly certain story elements were wrapped up or the way they played out. (Case in point, the aguara storyline in *Season of Storms.)*\n\n**The way it makes you think.** Interestingly enough, it wasn't the philosophical conversations that made me thoughtful. More than once, I found myself burning through a chapter or scene, only to have to go back and re-read something that was left carefully and deliberately vague, or which was explained only *just* enough to make you draw your own conclusions. \n\n**The world.** There's no denying the world of the Witcher is brilliantly rich, colorful, dark, gritty, and filled with countless fascinating details. Every city felt so utterly unique and compelling, every village and hamlet had its own quirks. Honestly, some of the best and most enjoyable world-building I've read.\n\n**The characters.** Dandelion is a delight. Zoltan Chivay was a wonderful altruist. Regis was a surprise. Yennefer's \"dear friend\" letter had me howling with laughter. So many of the characters who appeared in the series were just so much fun to read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I did have a hard time with a few things:\n\n**The storytelling.** As much fun as it was to read Geralt's stories, more often than not it felt like Geralt's *wanderings.* Though the author made a point of having a character explain that Geralt was traveling to travel and not reach a certain destination, they didn't use his wanderings to tell a specific story or play to a theme. Case in point, Baptism of Fire. The book is clearly used to illustrate the aftermath of a war and its effects on the people who suffer most. But there was no cohesive through-line or story \"circle\" that was closed by the end. It felt like like a proper book (with start, middle, and end) and more like the collection of short stories like in *The Last Wish* or *Sword of Destiny.* \n\nI'll admit this could be simply that storytelling in Poland is done differently than in Western literature. This is very much the case with Japanese manga/anime, Korean/K-drama, and Latin American novelas. We who read a lot of \"Western literature\" are used to things like the Three Act Structure, the Hero's Journey, and other structural elements that make a story feel \"right\". When books diverge from that structure, it can sometimes feel off.\n\n**The lack of monsters.** The combat of *The Witcher III: Wild Hunt* was almost as much of a highlight for me as the Gwent card game. I particularly loved how Geralt had to approach combat with each monster in a specific way, with specific tactics and even weaponry. \n\nThe books were attempting to show that the \"neutrality of witchers\" was untenable, that they couldn't absent themselves from the world's strifes by turning a blind eye, hence the focus on the *human* enemies. But I did find myself wishing for more demonstrations of Geralt's approach to and knowledge of various monsters. It would fit more in line with the Witcher we got in both the game and TV show (which, I acknowledge, are very different forms of media than books).\n\n**The character development.** There were minor changes in some of the characters: Geralt and his morality, Ciri and her evolution, even Yennefer and her becoming more maternal toward Ciri and her relationship with Geralt. \n\nBut for the most part, they and the rest of the characters felt largely static. Don't get me wrong, they were very well-crafted and three-dimensional. Yet they remained the same for as long as they remained in the story. No one evolved or changed, they just continued on the way they were, driven by their own hopes, dreams, and desires and only *slightly* adapted by the world around them. But there was far less character development, even for the main characters, than I'd have wished. \n\nAgain, this could simply be a different approach to storytelling than I'm accustomed to. Or, perhaps, that's what the author was trying to do with the story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will close this by saying that I read each of the books back to back, and burned through the series as quickly as I could because...well, it's the Witcher! But had I not been so engaged by the game (I got HOOKED HARD!) and the TV show (Henry Cavill nailed it), I might not have continued.\n\nSo if I had to rate the Witcher in all his forms of media:\n\n* **The games** are the best depiction, by a LANDSLIDE.\n* **The books** tell a more complex story with greater focus on the politics and the world at large, but the **TV series** depicts characters that are far more engaging and compelling."

        "body": " I've been wanting to create this post for months but I never did. I decided to create it now, because even many months later I am still surprised that this series was much better and more faithful than the other two.\n\nWitcher should be an easy adaptation, it has the short stories and then the story, which is actually simple and not very thick books, but the second season of the Netflix series was horrible! You can't practically call the season an adaptation of the books, most of the story was invented and filler and contradicts the plot of the books, if they thought that a single book does not have enough plot for a single season they could have then adapted two books in season 2. They also made up a whole story of Ciri summoning monsters and some obelisks and various other plots, how they turned Francesca and Fringilla into completely different characters that bear no resemblance to the ones in the books, with different personalities and backstories, the Yennefer's actress is good, as are several other actors in the series, but she spent the entire season on an invented plot and I don't know how they will fix her relationship with Ciri, in which both see each other as mother and daughter after she tried kill her (!!!).\n\nRings of Power was also a horrible adaptation, I know it would be difficult to create a story in the Second Age, but the story they created was not good. They for some reason put Isildur together with Celebrimbor at the same time. In an interview, they said that if they followed the books they would have to change the human characters every season, but they could have at least simplified the series then to have just two different periods, the first seasons with the creation of the rings of power plot and then midway through the series, after season 2/3, a timeskip with a new human cast. So you could show the prime of Numenor and then the corrupted version of it and just do a single human cast change. So it would show the passage of time and they would only have two sets of human characters, now they would have to put all the events of the second era in a few years.\n\nAnd they did what most people wanted to be the plot of an entire season, the creation of the rings of Celebrimbor, in a single episode (!!!) for some reason, and they cut pretty much the whole relationship between Sauron and Celebrimbor , which is one of the most important, complex and explored relationships in the books, practically does not exist in the series, all the friendship between them, Sauron convincing him to create the rings and ignore Celeborn and Galadriel's warnings, the fact that they together have become become the most important people in Eregion, how it seems that they traded the most important relationship that was between Sauron and Celebrimbor for Sauron and Galadriel, all their dynamics and relationships that could be explored and developed, the whole history of politics in Eregion that could have lasted one season and be important for the next seasons, I feel that it was cut, less than one episode, why those responsible for the series preferred to invent a relationship between Sauron and Galadriel for some reason (and it is because of them being a woman and a man?).\n\nBut in fact the series had other problems, as it seemed that the plots were very slow and did not move, the best and most fun plot of the series was Celebrimbor with the dwarves. In addition, the whole plot of the Southlands was horrible, all the people who lived in the region called it that, it did not have a name of its own, in addition to the fact that it had no scale, after the village where they lived was attacked by Orcs and the population fled and met in a tiny tavern, they talk to all the survivors in the region (!!!) and then meet with the army of Numenor, the Kingdom seemed tiny.\n\nAnd finally Wheel of Time, the series was not perfect and had several problems, but it was a good adaptation and watching the series it can be seen that those responsible read and knew the books intimately, several (but not all) modifications can be explained to summarize the plot of the books to have the first season only 8 episodes and the series to have in total only between six and eight seasons, because different from the previous series these books are huge, in addition to several of the modifications in the first episodes and in the last episodes were why Amazon told them to cut the first episode in half (it originally would have been two hours) and there was a break of months before the filming of the last episodes because of the coronavirus, where they they lost an actor in this break (Mat) and they had that completely change the footage of the final battle against the Trollocs. Of course the series had problems, as for example Rand was less prominent than necessary for most of the season. So this first season was just ok, but it was a good and relatively faithful adaptation to the books."

If you\u2019re comparing Witcher books with each other, quality has gone up since *Blood of Elves* if that\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about. We also see the Abyss Watchers making an appearance and then you think of Jerma\u2019s Rat song in your head for inexplicable reasons.\n\nThis book is mostly about Yennefer trying to employ questionable (albeit understandable) parenting tactics on Ciri and being caught up in the after math.\n\nAs usual, book is dated towards rape, but the only saving grace is it\u2019s \u201coff screen\u201d and not in your *face, \u201cEleventh Cycle\u201d, knock that shit off*\n\nLet\u2019s be real, you can\u2019t treat this series as a separate unique book to it\u2019s own, it\u2019s more of a long ass story that Sapkowski decided for marketing reasons to space it out in 300+ page books.\n\nIf you ask me what makes this more interesting than the previous books, it will be like asking me which regional orange looks different and bitch, I don\u2019t got energy for that shit.\n\n**\u00d6**  Theme: [Rats Birthday Mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdVnnMOTe3Q)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[***The Curse of the Spectre Queen***](https://www.amazon.com/Curse-of-the-Specter-Queen/dp/B094XCW4V8/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Curse+of+the+Spectre+Queen&qid=1685549337&sr=8-1) ***/*** [***The Rise of the Snake Goddess***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZJYJBXQ?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_1&storeType=ebooks&qid=1685549354&sr=8-1) ***by Jenny Moke***\n\nRead if you like to imagine Indiana Jones as a teenage girl, but loves books. Instead of meeting hot girls, we meet hot 1920s men, which you get to decide how good or bad that is.\n\nThe BAMF slays and you wish we had her as our Jones instead of our shy book loving MC, but hey, at least this MC has at least *one* quality to her that has way more personality that anything Shannon can hope to write in her stories. (Yes I know she writes her books as if they were history books, that\u2019s not the point, Meredith)\n\n*Spectre Queen\u2019s* plot is literally about another book that will make you hug trees and will lead our characters across to Ireland. The next book is about a girdle, that you literally had to Google wtf a girdle was. You first thought it was a grill.\n\nYou wonder if the publishing agency struck a deal with the Irish and Crete travel agencies.\n\nYou also make a startling discovery that these characters are your OC from high school and middle school and your love interest OC from college mashed up into an adventure book that is oddly less erotic than anything Maas could create.

It\u2019s mostly a vibe/fart than a plot or atmosphere.\n\nWhat this book is pretty much: boy wants to help dad, there are weird monsters living in the mud, and a mansion that totally wants to abduct/help kids. Totally. Oh, and be aware, animals die in this book. A lot. An entire species is pretty much annihilated for teenage hormonal reasons that won\u2019t make sense even if you\u2019re still a teen. (Yes, I was one too and I also didn\u2019t go on genocides. Thanks, Dad, you are a gem.). Oh, and someone fucked an anthropomorphized hedgehog along the way. Yeah. That happened.\n\nIf you go into this book, ***DO NOT READ THE BLURB***! It ruins the whole plot of the entire book. If you buy/rent it, don\u2019t you dare flip to the back side.

You also like the ooey gooey feeling of finding a red/blue ship that you wished was the main pairing, but you\u2019ll have to settle them being the side ship. *Oh god, why, every single time?!*\n\nWhile it does have a romance tilt to it, this book focuses more on finding a cure for a mysterious illness and two of the characters are refugees from a religious cult that loves sunshine and that one weird horse mount from the *Empire Strikes Back* that you couldn\u2019t take the auroshees seriously because of that.\n\nImagine that desert bar scene in *A New Hope*, but make it a *whole* book. But make it about a heist as a side plot that is barely touched on until the last 20% of the novel.\n\nYou also love doing puzzles in your spare time as you\u2019ll be doing a lot of piecing together of the plot and world building from chapter to chapter. Unlike my problems, this one is pieceable and the last remaining piece is dangled over your head until the next book.\n\n...Sangster is probably going to make you pay $20 for this singular piece, ain\u2019t she?\n\n**\u00d6** Theme: First Aid Kit - The Lion\u2019s Roar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqS1MV\\_xA\\_I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqS1MV_xA_I)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***Medium Raw***](https://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Anthony-Bourdain-audiobook/dp/B003VXG9VW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Medium+Raw&qid=1685549449&sr=8-1) ***by Anthony Bourdain***\n\nRead if you want to have a blunt conversation with Bourdain about food, the faults of the kitchens, what not to do if you want to be a chef, and to be transported to the deepest, darkest alley where you might be knifed, but goddamn, the best chicken heart can be found here.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bitch that\u2019s easily spooked by curse words, then this probably isn\u2019t for you. Though...you can sneak this to your cook boyfriend if you want to break up, because he already read the fucking book, Berta, I thought you knew him better by now!...Now you can finally segway to break up. Congratulations!\n\nYou\u2019ll see the workings of a mind that was suffering. That was the reflection of this entire autobiography. Suffering and food. That\u2019s life in reality, ain\u2019t it?\n\nDon\u2019t expect cohesion or a semblance of logical flow of pacing. This book, like Mr. Bourdain\u2019s mind, was a cluster fuck of erotically describing food, the dark corners and reality of the cooking world, and shitting on people because they were dicks.\n\nHe is sorely missed, and this isn\u2019t a bit, but I still mourn his loss to the world. The world needs him again.\n\nRIP to the GOAT.\n\n**\u00d6** *Theme: Okami \u2013 Sei-an (Aristocratic Quarter II)* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXsEqNBTYE*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXsEqNBTYE) *(Because he\u2019s timeless and immortal even beyond death)*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***Skullduggery Pleasant***](https://www.amazon.com/Skulduggery-Pleasant-Derek-Landy-audiobook/dp/B07B11LXSP/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=skulduggery+pleasant&qid=1685549487&sr=8-2) ***by Derek Landy***\n\nRead if you got tired of everything happy and sunshine in Percy Jackson and wanted *blood, death, knives, SKELETONS, AND* 12 year olds that are surprisingly self aware of the fact that they\u2019re a *teenager.* You want less consumerism and capitalism than what Percy Jackson pushed down your throat. Finally, no mentions of those fucking gold arches, *Riordan*.\n\nOddly, no parents are dead in this book. In every YA book you read, there is at least one parent dead, gone to get milk, or playing *Tears of the Kingdom. Pleasant* surprise for this narrator.\n\nYou are also a person that hates world building that lastS for pages and pages. There\u2019s none of that in this book. Expect pages of dialogue like it\u2019s a transcript of my parent\u2019s arguments.\n\nMom, I don\u2019t agree with you. No, I don\u2019t agree with you either, Dad. *You fucking little\u2026.Just plant the damn fig tree, for fuck\u2019s sake.*\n\nFrom other sources, apparently the book series gets darker as books go on, so take that as you will. Listening to Eminem and Linken Park between books may increase levels of angst in the subsequent books.\n\nSide effects include: angst, a potentially bi-found family that lasts 10 seconds, fear of skeletons, mourning for fictional characters, and teenagers being oddly logical.\n\nPost script: This would actually make an excellent autumnal book cause of spoopy skeletons.\n\n**\u00d6** Theme: Lose Yourself \u2013 Eminem: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM) (I was yesterday old when I realized \u201cMom\u2019s spaghetti\u201d lyrics was this song)\n\n**\u00d6** Runner up clip: [Spooky scary skeletons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qbGJuxCYY)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***The White Rose (Volume 3 of the Black Company)***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SQOUA8?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_2&storeType=ebooks&qid=1685549514&sr=8-3) ***by Glen Cook***\n\nRead if you liked having Charm flashbacks of Volume 1, but want a great dopamine rush in Volume 3.\n\n*Night Circus* got nothing on this book for reasons you\u2019ll figure out later. Expect a lot of weird crack shenanigans such as talking rocks just to name an example. The Lady\u2019s character is fleshed out a lot more than previous volumes. Twists and turns are aplenty and Croacker complaining he\u2019s too old like an old grandpa shopping 10 AM at a Walmart.\n\nFunny enough, Morgenstern is a lot related to this book in more ways than one. Move over, lady, Cook was the original writer of *Night Circus,* caramel popcorn and candy apples be damned! We\u2019re eating crusty bread and thickened stew, bitch!\n\nYou\u2019re not going to be at the edge of your seat until the last percentage of the book, but it\u2019s worth the dopamine rush and emotions that are given in the end, long after you put the book down. You will find yourself wandering around the library wondering how you returned from a reality of flying manta rays and talking rocks...to old ass Swedes loitering in the lobby, discussing where to fika next.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a lot of Monsters to process your emotions tonight.\n\nYou also finally figure out where Miyazaki got the inspiration for the Storm King in *Demon Souls.* All this time, you got mad at Miyazaki for inserting a giant manta ray for disappointing climax reasons. No. He may have understood *Black Company* more than we thought.\n\nColeydoesthings is also screaming at the top of her lungs by the end of the book, crying into her body pillow.\n\n**\u00d6** Theme: MSR \u2013 Lord of the Wolves: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izFwwGx-wmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izFwwGx-wmo) (Someone help me on the EX Stages omfg)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Conclusion**: @\n\nI\u2019ll be traveling soon, so the books might be on the short side, but my dumbass quality will remain.

        "body": "I think I got into the Witcher's story the *opposite* way so many others did:\n\n1. I watched the Netflix TV shows Season 1 and 2 first\n2. I played The Witcher III: Wild Hunt (and all its DLCs) second\n3. I only *just* finished reading the Witcher books (all eight of them back to back)\n\nAnd I have to say: the Witcher books were a little bit of a letdown for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there was A LOT to love:\n\n**The clever writing.** The author has a really fun tongue-in-cheek way of describing many things--from sex to jokes to the way people die both on and off screen--that feels very clever. There were plenty of times that I was pleasantly surprised by how neatly certain story elements were wrapped up or the way they played out. (Case in point, the aguara storyline in *Season of Storms.)*\n\n**The way it makes you think.** Interestingly enough, it wasn't the philosophical conversations that made me thoughtful. More than once, I found myself burning through a chapter or scene, only to have to go back and re-read something that was left carefully and deliberately vague, or which was explained only *just* enough to make you draw your own conclusions. \n\n**The world.** There's no denying the world of the Witcher is brilliantly rich, colorful, dark, gritty, and filled with countless fascinating details. Every city felt so utterly unique and compelling, every village and hamlet had its own quirks. Honestly, some of the best and most enjoyable world-building I've read.\n\n**The characters.** Dandelion is a delight. Zoltan Chivay was a wonderful altruist. Regis was a surprise. Yennefer's \"dear friend\" letter had me howling with laughter. So many of the characters who appeared in the series were just so much fun to read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I did have a hard time with a few things:\n\n**The storytelling.** As much fun as it was to read Geralt's stories, more often than not it felt like Geralt's *wanderings.* Though the author made a point of having a character explain that Geralt was traveling to travel and not reach a certain destination, they didn't use his wanderings to tell a specific story or play to a theme. Case in point, Baptism of Fire. The book is clearly used to illustrate the aftermath of a war and its effects on the people who suffer most. But there was no cohesive through-line or story \"circle\" that was closed by the end. It felt like like a proper book (with start, middle, and end) and more like the collection of short stories like in *The Last Wish* or *Sword of Destiny.* \n\nI'll admit this could be simply that storytelling in Poland is done differently than in Western literature. This is very much the case with Japanese manga/anime, Korean/K-drama, and Latin American novelas. We who read a lot of \"Western literature\" are used to things like the Three Act Structure, the Hero's Journey, and other structural elements that make a story feel \"right\". When books diverge from that structure, it can sometimes feel off.\n\n**The lack of monsters.** The combat of *The Witcher III: Wild Hunt* was almost as much of a highlight for me as the Gwent card game. I particularly loved how Geralt had to approach combat with each monster in a specific way, with specific tactics and even weaponry. \n\nThe books were attempting to show that the \"neutrality of witchers\" was untenable, that they couldn't absent themselves from the world's strifes by turning a blind eye, hence the focus on the *human* enemies. But I did find myself wishing for more demonstrations of Geralt's approach to and knowledge of various monsters. It would fit more in line with the Witcher we got in both the game and TV show (which, I acknowledge, are very different forms of media than books).\n\n**The character development.** There were minor changes in some of the characters: Geralt and his morality, Ciri and her evolution, even Yennefer and her becoming more maternal toward Ciri and her relationship with Geralt. \n\nBut for the most part, they and the rest of the characters felt largely static. Don't get me wrong, they were very well-crafted and three-dimensional. Yet they remained the same for as long as they remained in the story. No one evolved or changed, they just continued on the way they were, driven by their own hopes, dreams, and desires and only *slightly* adapted by the world around them. But there was far less character development, even for the main characters, than I'd have wished. \n\nAgain, this could simply be a different approach to storytelling than I'm accustomed to. Or, perhaps, that's what the author was trying to do with the story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will close this by saying that I read each of the books back to back, and burned through the series as quickly as I could because...well, it's the Witcher! But had I not been so engaged by the game (I got HOOKED HARD!) and the TV show (Henry Cavill nailed it), I might not have continued.\n\nSo if I had to rate the Witcher in all his forms of media:\n\n* **The games** are the best depiction, by a LANDSLIDE.\n* **The books** tell a more complex story with greater focus on the politics and the world at large, but the **TV series** depicts characters that are far more engaging and compelling."

I'm hoping to find some book that explore similar themes. \"The Wither\" series has a similar trope with the Geralt-Ciri relationship, for example. What are some other books or series that you would recommend? Thank you in advance for suggestions!"

The X-COM games and Doom are good examples. And while those games are awesome (especially Doom) I just hate this trope with all my heart. \n\nFor one, it's hard to invest or believe that humans would be protagonistic forces considering all the vile crap we do to each other and to our homes. And two, it makes a black-and-white story which is the laziest form of writing.  \n\nStories like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings portray humans as a neutral faction, not good or evil, which is great and perfectly realistic. But, I want to see stories that portray humans as the villainous factions. Stories that make us realize that even when you're surrounded by monsters, the worst of them is a human. \n\nAttack on Titan and Witcher are the ones I think of, in Attack On Titan we are meant to believe it's a \"Humanity F- Yeah!\" only to realize over time that in reality, even if there are giant naked people eating us, we still will have to fear humans. Witcher is also a good one as Geralt considers humans more of a monster than the ones he is trained to kill. In fact, in the books, Geralt states the first monster he ever killed was a human. \n\nWhat are some stories that show this?"

I read complete series, even if I knew how some things will end because I played the game, and I still liked it very much. I cannot say that it's some of the best books I have read, but it has something which captured me. I liked Geralt very much, I liked the tempo, and the way it was written. It was easy read, and the writer was more focused on the characters, and the story, rather than the world-building. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I am looking for something like that. My current mindset cannot focus on more complicated, Tolkien-like worlds. I would prefer something with a focus on one, or fewer main characters, an adventure, and a magical world, where I can go to chill, follow story, enjoy the writing, and not overthink too much if you know what I mean. It can be dark, it's even better if it is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe series I read that didn't manage to give me what I was looking for (but were still good): The Broken Empire trilogy, Demon Cycle, The Farseer trilogy, The Prince of Nothing trilogy...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thank you in advance for the time spent reading this."

I played The Witcher III: Wild Hunt (and all its DLCs) second\n3. I only *just* finished reading the Witcher books (all eight of them back to back)\n\nAnd I have to say: the Witcher books were a little bit of a letdown for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there was A LOT to love:\n\n**The clever writing.** The author has a really fun tongue-in-cheek way of describing many things--from sex to jokes to the way people die both on and off screen--that feels very clever. There were plenty of times that I was pleasantly surprised by how neatly certain story elements were wrapped up or the way they played out. (Case in point, the aguara storyline in *Season of Storms.)*\n\n**The way it makes you think.** Interestingly enough, it wasn't the philosophical conversations that made me thoughtful. More than once, I found myself burning through a chapter or scene, only to have to go back and re-read something that was left carefully and deliberately vague, or which was explained only *just* enough to make you draw your own conclusions. \n\n**The world.** There's no denying the world of the Witcher is brilliantly rich, colorful, dark, gritty, and filled with countless fascinating details. Every city felt so utterly unique and compelling, every village and hamlet had its own quirks. Honestly, some of the best and most enjoyable world-building I've read.\n\n**The characters.** Dandelion is a delight. Zoltan Chivay was a wonderful altruist. Regis was a surprise. Yennefer's \"dear friend\" letter had me howling with laughter. So many of the characters who appeared in the series were just so much fun to read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I did have a hard time with a few things:\n\n**The storytelling.** As much fun as it was to read Geralt's stories, more often than not it felt like Geralt's *wanderings.* Though the author made a point of having a character explain that Geralt was traveling to travel and not reach a certain destination, they didn't use his wanderings to tell a specific story or play to a theme. Case in point, Baptism of Fire. The book is clearly used to illustrate the aftermath of a war and its effects on the people who suffer most. But there was no cohesive through-line or story \"circle\" that was closed by the end. It felt like like a proper book (with start, middle, and end) and more like the collection of short stories like in *The Last Wish* or *Sword of Destiny.* \n\nI'll admit this could be simply that storytelling in Poland is done differently than in Western literature. This is very much the case with Japanese manga/anime, Korean/K-drama, and Latin American novelas. We who read a lot of \"Western literature\" are used to things like the Three Act Structure, the Hero's Journey, and other structural elements that make a story feel \"right\". When books diverge from that structure, it can sometimes feel off.\n\n**The lack of monsters.** The combat of *The Witcher III: Wild Hunt* was almost as much of a highlight for me as the Gwent card game. I particularly loved how Geralt had to approach combat with each monster in a specific way, with specific tactics and even weaponry. \n\nThe books were attempting to show that the \"neutrality of witchers\" was untenable, that they couldn't absent themselves from the world's strifes by turning a blind eye, hence the focus on the *human* enemies. But I did find myself wishing for more demonstrations of Geralt's approach to and knowledge of various monsters. It would fit more in line with the Witcher we got in both the game and TV show (which, I acknowledge, are very different forms of media than books).\n\n**The character development.** There were minor changes in some of the characters: Geralt and his morality, Ciri and her evolution, even Yennefer and her becoming more maternal toward Ciri and her relationship with Geralt. \n\nBut for the most part, they and the rest of the characters felt largely static. Don't get me wrong, they were very well-crafted and three-dimensional. Yet they remained the same for as long as they remained in the story. No one evolved or changed, they just continued on the way they were, driven by their own hopes, dreams, and desires and only *slightly* adapted by the world around them. But there was far less character development, even for the main characters, than I'd have wished. \n\nAgain, this could simply be a different approach to storytelling than I'm accustomed to. Or, perhaps, that's what the author was trying to do with the story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will close this by saying that I read each of the books back to back, and burned through the series as quickly as I could because...well, it's the Witcher! But had I not been so engaged by the game (I got HOOKED HARD!) and the TV show (Henry Cavill nailed it), I might not have continued.\n\nSo if I had to rate the Witcher in all his forms of media:\n\n* **The games** are the best depiction, by a LANDSLIDE.\n* **The books** tell a more complex story with greater focus on the politics and the world at large, but the **TV series** depicts characters that are far more engaging and compelling."

You can't practically call the season an adaptation of the books, most of the story was invented and filler and contradicts the plot of the books, if they thought that a single book does not have enough plot for a single season they could have then adapted two books in season 2. They also made up a whole story of Ciri summoning monsters and some obelisks and various other plots, how they turned Francesca and Fringilla into completely different characters that bear no resemblance to the ones in the books, with different personalities and backstories, the Yennefer's actress is good, as are several other actors in the series, but she spent the entire season on an invented plot and I don't know how they will fix her relationship with Ciri, in which both see each other as mother and daughter after she tried kill her (!!!).\n\nRings of Power was also a horrible adaptation, I know it would be difficult to create a story in the Second Age, but the story they created was not good. They for some reason put Isildur together with Celebrimbor at the same time. In an interview, they said that if they followed the books they would have to change the human characters every season, but they could have at least simplified the series then to have just two different periods, the first seasons with the creation of the rings of power plot and then midway through the series, after season 2/3, a timeskip with a new human cast. So you could show the prime of Numenor and then the corrupted version of it and just do a single human cast change. So it would show the passage of time and they would only have two sets of human characters, now they would have to put all the events of the second era in a few years.\n\nAnd they did what most people wanted to be the plot of an entire season, the creation of the rings of Celebrimbor, in a single episode (!!!) for some reason, and they cut pretty much the whole relationship between Sauron and Celebrimbor , which is one of the most important, complex and explored relationships in the books, practically does not exist in the series, all the friendship between them, Sauron convincing him to create the rings and ignore Celeborn and Galadriel's warnings, the fact that they together have become become the most important people in Eregion, how it seems that they traded the most important relationship that was between Sauron and Celebrimbor for Sauron and Galadriel, all their dynamics and relationships that could be explored and developed, the whole history of politics in Eregion that could have lasted one season and be important for the next seasons, I feel that it was cut, less than one episode, why those responsible for the series preferred to invent a relationship between Sauron and Galadriel for some reason (and it is because of them being a woman and a man?).\n\nBut in fact the series had other problems, as it seemed that the plots were very slow and did not move, the best and most fun plot of the series was Celebrimbor with the dwarves. In addition, the whole plot of the Southlands was horrible, all the people who lived in the region called it that, it did not have a name of its own, in addition to the fact that it had no scale, after the village where they lived was attacked by Orcs and the population fled and met in a tiny tavern, they talk to all the survivors in the region (!!!) and then meet with the army of Numenor, the Kingdom seemed tiny.\n\nAnd finally Wheel of Time, the series was not perfect and had several problems, but it was a good adaptation and watching the series it can be seen that those responsible read and knew the books intimately, several (but not all) modifications can be explained to summarize the plot of the books to have the first season only 8 episodes and the series to have in total only between six and eight seasons, because different from the previous series these books are huge, in addition to several of the modifications in the first episodes and in the last episodes were why Amazon told them to cut the first episode in half (it originally would have been two hours) and there was a break of months before the filming of the last episodes because of the coronavirus, where they they lost an actor in this break (Mat) and they had that completely change the footage of the final battle against the Trollocs. Of course the series had problems, as for example Rand was less prominent than necessary for most of the season. So this first season was just ok, but it was a good and relatively faithful adaptation to the books."

If you haven\u2019t, then maybe this would come as a surprise.\n\nAtheism is talked about on the nose, you can't stop thinking about \u201cFriends\u201d because of \"Roz\" being mentioned every other second, and our intrepid MC goes to horny jail every other second when she's literally fighting for her life and not focusing on a gun that could disembowel her.\n\nPTSD of war is represented by the male MC who probably once could have been the trope of the \u201cnice guy\u201d in school that you never had interest in, but 3 years later, because he sported 5 o\u2019 clock shadow and has a baritone voice, he\u2019s automatically hot.\n\nOh, and there are token bi, POC, and elderly people, but they\u2019re only mentioned for a few pages, so don\u2019t expect that much diversity.

So that Italian will actually *not* join us even though you liked his character a ton and curse at yourself at a potential LGBT partner dude. One day.\n\nYou will also find yourself crying, not because of how the story ended, but how the epilogue ended and boot up AO3 to fix everything.\n\nYou probably should(n\u2019t) give this book to your aunt for reasons you know in the back of your mind but your evil AF. Maybe offer this to at Christmas and explain that it\u2019s a book about a pilgrimage...(which isn\u2019t totally wrong) but you\u2019re a little bastard that is gonna get an ass whopping next Christmas, but it\u2019ll be worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u00d6** *Theme: Alika- Bridges:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO9g5t3VSuw*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO9g5t3VSuw)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[***Time of Contempt (Volume (???))*** ](https://www.amazon.com/The-Time-of-Contempt-audiobook/dp/B01092S9R4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Time+of+Contempt+Volume+3&qid=1685549259&sr=8-1) ***by Andrzej Sapkowski (Witcher)***\n\nRead if you want to see Geralt turn into a woke ally Boomer, Yennefer going to relationship counseling, and Ciri gets her wish in more ways than one. If you\u2019re comparing Witcher books with each other, quality has gone up since *Blood of Elves* if that\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about. We also see the Abyss Watchers making an appearance and then you think of Jerma\u2019s Rat song in your head for inexplicable reasons.\n\nThis book is mostly about Yennefer trying to employ questionable (albeit understandable) parenting tactics on Ciri and being caught up in the after math.\n\nAs usual, book is dated towards rape, but the only saving grace is it\u2019s \u201coff screen\u201d and not in your *face, \u201cEleventh Cycle\u201d, knock that shit off*\n\nLet\u2019s be real, you can\u2019t treat this series as a separate unique book to it\u2019s own, it\u2019s more of a long ass story that Sapkowski decided for marketing reasons to space it out in 300+ page books.\n\nIf you ask me what makes this more interesting than the previous books, it will be like asking me which regional orange looks different and bitch, I don\u2019t got energy for that shit.\n\n**\u00d6**  Theme: [Rats Birthday Mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdVnnMOTe3Q)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[***The Curse of the Spectre Queen***](https://www.amazon.com/Curse-of-the-Specter-Queen/dp/B094XCW4V8/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Curse+of+the+Spectre+Queen&qid=1685549337&sr=8-1) ***/*** [***The Rise of the Snake Goddess***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZJYJBXQ?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_1&storeType=ebooks&qid=1685549354&sr=8-1) ***by Jenny Moke***\n\nRead if you like to imagine Indiana Jones as a teenage girl, but loves books. Instead of meeting hot girls, we meet hot 1920s men, which you get to decide how good or bad that is.\n\nThe BAMF slays and you wish we had her as our Jones instead of our shy book loving MC, but hey, at least this MC has at least *one* quality to her that has way more personality that anything Shannon can hope to write in her stories. (Yes I know she writes her books as if they were history books, that\u2019s not the point, Meredith)\n\n*Spectre Queen\u2019s* plot is literally about another book that will make you hug trees and will lead our characters across to Ireland. The next book is about a girdle, that you literally had to Google wtf a girdle was. You first thought it was a grill.\n\nYou wonder if the publishing agency struck a deal with the Irish and Crete travel agencies.\n\nYou also make a startling discovery that these characters are your OC from high school and middle school and your love interest OC from college mashed up into an adventure book that is oddly less erotic than anything Maas could create.

It\u2019s mostly a vibe/fart than a plot or atmosphere.\n\nWhat this book is pretty much: boy wants to help dad, there are weird monsters living in the mud, and a mansion that totally wants to abduct/help kids. Totally. Oh, and be aware, animals die in this book. A lot. An entire species is pretty much annihilated for teenage hormonal reasons that won\u2019t make sense even if you\u2019re still a teen. (Yes, I was one too and I also didn\u2019t go on genocides. Thanks, Dad, you are a gem.). Oh, and someone fucked an anthropomorphized hedgehog along the way. Yeah. That happened.\n\nIf you go into this book, ***DO NOT READ THE BLURB***! It ruins the whole plot of the entire book. If you buy/rent it, don\u2019t you dare flip to the back side.

You also like the ooey gooey feeling of finding a red/blue ship that you wished was the main pairing, but you\u2019ll have to settle them being the side ship. *Oh god, why, every single time?!*\n\nWhile it does have a romance tilt to it, this book focuses more on finding a cure for a mysterious illness and two of the characters are refugees from a religious cult that loves sunshine and that one weird horse mount from the *Empire Strikes Back* that you couldn\u2019t take the auroshees seriously because of that.\n\nImagine that desert bar scene in *A New Hope*, but make it a *whole* book. But make it about a heist as a side plot that is barely touched on until the last 20% of the novel.\n\nYou also love doing puzzles in your spare time as you\u2019ll be doing a lot of piecing together of the plot and world building from chapter to chapter. Unlike my problems, this one is pieceable and the last remaining piece is dangled over your head until the next book.\n\n...Sangster is probably going to make you pay $20 for this singular piece, ain\u2019t she?\n\n**\u00d6** Theme: First Aid Kit - The Lion\u2019s Roar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqS1MV\\_xA\\_I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqS1MV_xA_I)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***Medium Raw***](https://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Anthony-Bourdain-audiobook/dp/B003VXG9VW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Medium+Raw&qid=1685549449&sr=8-1) ***by Anthony Bourdain***\n\nRead if you want to have a blunt conversation with Bourdain about food, the faults of the kitchens, what not to do if you want to be a chef, and to be transported to the deepest, darkest alley where you might be knifed, but goddamn, the best chicken heart can be found here.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bitch that\u2019s easily spooked by curse words, then this probably isn\u2019t for you. Though...you can sneak this to your cook boyfriend if you want to break up, because he already read the fucking book, Berta, I thought you knew him better by now!...Now you can finally segway to break up. Congratulations!\n\nYou\u2019ll see the workings of a mind that was suffering. That was the reflection of this entire autobiography. Suffering and food. That\u2019s life in reality, ain\u2019t it?\n\nDon\u2019t expect cohesion or a semblance of logical flow of pacing. This book, like Mr. Bourdain\u2019s mind, was a cluster fuck of erotically describing food, the dark corners and reality of the cooking world, and shitting on people because they were dicks.\n\nHe is sorely missed, and this isn\u2019t a bit, but I still mourn his loss to the world. The world needs him again.\n\nRIP to the GOAT.\n\n**\u00d6** *Theme: Okami \u2013 Sei-an (Aristocratic Quarter II)* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXsEqNBTYE*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXsEqNBTYE) *(Because he\u2019s timeless and immortal even beyond death)*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***Skullduggery Pleasant***](https://www.amazon.com/Skulduggery-Pleasant-Derek-Landy-audiobook/dp/B07B11LXSP/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=skulduggery+pleasant&qid=1685549487&sr=8-2) ***by Derek Landy***\n\nRead if you got tired of everything happy and sunshine in Percy Jackson and wanted *blood, death, knives, SKELETONS, AND* 12 year olds that are surprisingly self aware of the fact that they\u2019re a *teenager.* You want less consumerism and capitalism than what Percy Jackson pushed down your throat. Finally, no mentions of those fucking gold arches, *Riordan*.\n\nOddly, no parents are dead in this book. In every YA book you read, there is at least one parent dead, gone to get milk, or playing *Tears of the Kingdom. Pleasant* surprise for this narrator.\n\nYou are also a person that hates world building that lastS for pages and pages. There\u2019s none of that in this book. Expect pages of dialogue like it\u2019s a transcript of my parent\u2019s arguments.\n\nMom, I don\u2019t agree with you. No, I don\u2019t agree with you either, Dad. *You fucking little\u2026.Just plant the damn fig tree, for fuck\u2019s sake.*\n\nFrom other sources, apparently the book series gets darker as books go on, so take that as you will. Listening to Eminem and Linken Park between books may increase levels of angst in the subsequent books.\n\nSide effects include: angst, a potentially bi-found family that lasts 10 seconds, fear of skeletons, mourning for fictional characters, and teenagers being oddly logical.\n\nPost script: This would actually make an excellent autumnal book cause of spoopy skeletons.\n\n**\u00d6** Theme: Lose Yourself \u2013 Eminem: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM) (I was yesterday old when I realized \u201cMom\u2019s spaghetti\u201d lyrics was this song)\n\n**\u00d6** Runner up clip: [Spooky scary skeletons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qbGJuxCYY)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***The White Rose (Volume 3 of the Black Company)***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SQOUA8?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_2&storeType=ebooks&qid=1685549514&sr=8-3) ***by Glen Cook***\n\nRead if you liked having Charm flashbacks of Volume 1, but want a great dopamine rush in Volume 3.\n\n*Night Circus* got nothing on this book for reasons you\u2019ll figure out later. Expect a lot of weird crack shenanigans such as talking rocks just to name an example. The Lady\u2019s character is fleshed out a lot more than previous volumes. Twists and turns are aplenty and Croacker complaining he\u2019s too old like an old grandpa shopping 10 AM at a Walmart.\n\nFunny enough, Morgenstern is a lot related to this book in more ways than one. Move over, lady, Cook was the original writer of *Night Circus,* caramel popcorn and candy apples be damned! We\u2019re eating crusty bread and thickened stew, bitch!\n\nYou\u2019re not going to be at the edge of your seat until the last percentage of the book, but it\u2019s worth the dopamine rush and emotions that are given in the end, long after you put the book down. You will find yourself wandering around the library wondering how you returned from a reality of flying manta rays and talking rocks...to old ass Swedes loitering in the lobby, discussing where to fika next.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a lot of Monsters to process your emotions tonight.\n\nYou also finally figure out where Miyazaki got the inspiration for the Storm King in *Demon Souls.* All this time, you got mad at Miyazaki for inserting a giant manta ray for disappointing climax reasons. No. He may have understood *Black Company* more than we thought.\n\nColeydoesthings is also screaming at the top of her lungs by the end of the book, crying into her body pillow.\n\n**\u00d6** Theme: MSR \u2013 Lord of the Wolves: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izFwwGx-wmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izFwwGx-wmo) (Someone help me on the EX Stages omfg)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Conclusion**: @\n\nI\u2019ll be traveling soon, so the books might be on the short side, but my dumbass quality will remain.

I started reading the first book last week and quickly devoured it and it's sequel \"Martyr\" in that time. It was so good I had to vent about how much I loved it so I can convince others to give Anthony Ryan a chance again. I have rarely if ever read a series with characters that feel so real, conflicted, flawed and somehow still likeable. \n\nThe main character is very different from your classic peasant turned hero, Alwyn isn't really a good or honorable man like Vealin Al Sorna. He's not really naturally good at anything except some cunning, thieving and killing. He's bitter, vengeful, and quick tempered but you understand why he makes the decisions he does, and he has his own principles that make him likeable and honorable in his own way. \n\nI also love its treatment of religion and the nobility. Many fantasy books treat these actors with a lot of cynicism/contempt, and although I can't always disagree I appreciate when an author can develop a balanced representation, it just feels more realistic that way. Although the main character is cynical and skeptical they (and the reader) come to see that there are noble and awful characters on both \"sides\" and many more in between. \n\nLastly the descriptions of combat and war is fantastic. You really get the feeling of how terrifying it is to be in a medieval battle, most books I find gloss over it and focus on how badass the character is but not here, cowardice and bravery blend together in a visceral realistic way.\n\n**TLDR:** In sum it has pretty much everything I love in fantasy. There's intrigue, romance, politics, representation, coming of age themes, brotherly, and platonic friendships, battles, combat, education, and low magic. Although the story explores evil acts such as war, murder, sexual violence etc. it alludes to their awfulness without going into too much detail which I prefer. Please please do yourself a favor and read this book so I can read more reviews about it on the subreddit!"

If you\u2019re comparing Witcher books with each other, quality has gone up since *Blood of Elves* if that\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about. We also see the Abyss Watchers making an appearance and then you think of Jerma\u2019s Rat song in your head for inexplicable reasons.\n\nThis book is mostly about Yennefer trying to employ questionable (albeit understandable) parenting tactics on Ciri and being caught up in the after math.\n\nAs usual, book is dated towards rape, but the only saving grace is it\u2019s \u201coff screen\u201d and not in your *face, \u201cEleventh Cycle\u201d, knock that shit off*\n\nLet\u2019s be real, you can\u2019t treat this series as a separate unique book to it\u2019s own, it\u2019s more of a long ass story that Sapkowski decided for marketing reasons to space it out in 300+ page books.\n\nIf you ask me what makes this more interesting than the previous books, it will be like asking me which regional orange looks different and bitch, I don\u2019t got energy for that shit.\n\n**\u00d6**  Theme: [Rats Birthday Mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdVnnMOTe3Q)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[***The Curse of the Spectre Queen***](https://www.amazon.com/Curse-of-the-Specter-Queen/dp/B094XCW4V8/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Curse+of+the+Spectre+Queen&qid=1685549337&sr=8-1) ***/*** [***The Rise of the Snake Goddess***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZJYJBXQ?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_1&storeType=ebooks&qid=1685549354&sr=8-1) ***by Jenny Moke***\n\nRead if you like to imagine Indiana Jones as a teenage girl, but loves books.

(Yes I know she writes her books as if they were history books, that\u2019s not the point, Meredith)\n\n*Spectre Queen\u2019s* plot is literally about another book that will make you hug trees and will lead our characters across to Ireland. The next book is about a girdle, that you literally had to Google wtf a girdle was. You first thought it was a grill.\n\nYou wonder if the publishing agency struck a deal with the Irish and Crete travel agencies.\n\nYou also make a startling discovery that these characters are your OC from high school and middle school and your love interest OC from college mashed up into an adventure book that is oddly less erotic than anything Maas could create.

It\u2019s mostly a vibe/fart than a plot or atmosphere.\n\nWhat this book is pretty much: boy wants to help dad, there are weird monsters living in the mud, and a mansion that totally wants to abduct/help kids. Totally. Oh, and be aware, animals die in this book. A lot. An entire species is pretty much annihilated for teenage hormonal reasons that won\u2019t make sense even if you\u2019re still a teen. (Yes, I was one too and I also didn\u2019t go on genocides. Thanks, Dad, you are a gem.). Oh, and someone fucked an anthropomorphized hedgehog along the way. Yeah.

You also like the ooey gooey feeling of finding a red/blue ship that you wished was the main pairing, but you\u2019ll have to settle them being the side ship. *Oh god, why, every single time?!*\n\nWhile it does have a romance tilt to it, this book focuses more on finding a cure for a mysterious illness and two of the characters are refugees from a religious cult that loves sunshine and that one weird horse mount from the *Empire Strikes Back* that you couldn\u2019t take the auroshees seriously because of that.\n\nImagine that desert bar scene in *A New Hope*, but make it a *whole* book. But make it about a heist as a side plot that is barely touched on until the last 20% of the novel.\n\nYou also love doing puzzles in your spare time as you\u2019ll be doing a lot of piecing together of the plot and world building from chapter to chapter. Unlike my problems, this one is pieceable and the last remaining piece is dangled over your head until the next book.\n\n...Sangster is probably going to make you pay $20 for this singular piece, ain\u2019t she?\n\n**\u00d6** Theme: First Aid Kit - The Lion\u2019s Roar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqS1MV\\_xA\\_I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqS1MV_xA_I)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***Medium Raw***](https://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Anthony-Bourdain-audiobook/dp/B003VXG9VW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Medium+Raw&qid=1685549449&sr=8-1) ***by Anthony Bourdain***\n\nRead if you want to have a blunt conversation with Bourdain about food, the faults of the kitchens, what not to do if you want to be a chef, and to be transported to the deepest, darkest alley where you might be knifed, but goddamn, the best chicken heart can be found here.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bitch that\u2019s easily spooked by curse words, then this probably isn\u2019t for you. Though...you can sneak this to your cook boyfriend if you want to break up, because he already read the fucking book, Berta, I thought you knew him better by now!...Now you can finally segway to break up. Congratulations!\n\nYou\u2019ll see the workings of a mind that was suffering. That was the reflection of this entire autobiography. Suffering and food. That\u2019s life in reality, ain\u2019t it?\n\nDon\u2019t expect cohesion or a semblance of logical flow of pacing. This book, like Mr. Bourdain\u2019s mind, was a cluster fuck of erotically describing food, the dark corners and reality of the cooking world, and shitting on people because they were dicks.\n\nHe is sorely missed, and this isn\u2019t a bit, but I still mourn his loss to the world. The world needs him again.\n\nRIP to the GOAT.\n\n**\u00d6** *Theme: Okami \u2013 Sei-an (Aristocratic Quarter II)* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXsEqNBTYE*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXsEqNBTYE) *(Because he\u2019s timeless and immortal even beyond death)*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***Skullduggery Pleasant***](https://www.amazon.com/Skulduggery-Pleasant-Derek-Landy-audiobook/dp/B07B11LXSP/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=skulduggery+pleasant&qid=1685549487&sr=8-2) ***by Derek Landy***\n\nRead if you got tired of everything happy and sunshine in Percy Jackson and wanted *blood, death, knives, SKELETONS, AND* 12 year olds that are surprisingly self aware of the fact that they\u2019re a *teenager.* You want less consumerism and capitalism than what Percy Jackson pushed down your throat. Finally, no mentions of those fucking gold arches, *Riordan*.\n\nOddly, no parents are dead in this book. In every YA book you read, there is at least one parent dead, gone to get milk, or playing *Tears of the Kingdom. Pleasant* surprise for this narrator.\n\nYou are also a person that hates world building that lastS for pages and pages. There\u2019s none of that in this book. Expect pages of dialogue like it\u2019s a transcript of my parent\u2019s arguments.\n\nMom, I don\u2019t agree with you. No, I don\u2019t agree with you either, Dad. *You fucking little\u2026.Just plant the damn fig tree, for fuck\u2019s sake.*\n\nFrom other sources, apparently the book series gets darker as books go on, so take that as you will. Listening to Eminem and Linken Park between books may increase levels of angst in the subsequent books.\n\nSide effects include: angst, a potentially bi-found family that lasts 10 seconds, fear of skeletons, mourning for fictional characters, and teenagers being oddly logical.\n\nPost script: This would actually make an excellent autumnal book cause of spoopy skeletons.\n\n**\u00d6** Theme: Lose Yourself \u2013 Eminem: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM) (I was yesterday old when I realized \u201cMom\u2019s spaghetti\u201d lyrics was this song)\n\n**\u00d6** Runner up clip: [Spooky scary skeletons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qbGJuxCYY)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***The White Rose (Volume 3 of the Black Company)***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SQOUA8?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_2&storeType=ebooks&qid=1685549514&sr=8-3) ***by Glen Cook***\n\nRead if you liked having Charm flashbacks of Volume 1, but want a great dopamine rush in Volume 3.\n\n*Night Circus* got nothing on this book for reasons you\u2019ll figure out later. Expect a lot of weird crack shenanigans such as talking rocks just to name an example. The Lady\u2019s character is fleshed out a lot more than previous volumes. Twists and turns are aplenty and Croacker complaining he\u2019s too old like an old grandpa shopping 10 AM at a Walmart.\n\nFunny enough, Morgenstern is a lot related to this book in more ways than one. Move over, lady, Cook was the original writer of *Night Circus,* caramel popcorn and candy apples be damned! We\u2019re eating crusty bread and thickened stew, bitch!\n\nYou\u2019re not going to be at the edge of your seat until the last percentage of the book, but it\u2019s worth the dopamine rush and emotions that are given in the end, long after you put the book down. You will find yourself wandering around the library wondering how you returned from a reality of flying manta rays and talking rocks...to old ass Swedes loitering in the lobby, discussing where to fika next.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a lot of Monsters to process your emotions tonight.\n\nYou also finally figure out where Miyazaki got the inspiration for the Storm King in *Demon Souls.* All this time, you got mad at Miyazaki for inserting a giant manta ray for disappointing climax reasons.

        "body": "If you want to read what I thought of *Gardens of the Moon*, read my last post: [Malazan Book I \u2013 Gardens of the Moon + Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/11ept2n/review_malazan_book_i_gardens_of_the_moon/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeadhouse Gates\u2026 Horribly fantastic!\n\nMajor book spoilers ahead. Don\u2019t read this if you haven\u2019t read the book yet.\n\nSteven Erikson\u2019s writing took a giant leap in quality from Book I, from the prose itself to the framing of his scenes. I was fully drawn in and ready for the ride by the end of the prologue. Unfortunately, it took me a while to get through the book due to a busy life, but I sped through the last 80% or so in the last week, so most of it is fresh in my mind. It didn\u2019t help that I\u2019m writing my own novel and I take my time analyzing his writing as I read.\n\nSo many things I could talk about but that would take far too long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Felisin\u2019s Storyline\n\nThis was my favorite storyline in the book. So many questions, mostly revolving around Heboric, and so much emotion throughout. I usually don\u2019t care for characters like Felisin: young, immature, selfish, and generally a poor decision maker\u2013in fact, I usually hate these characters\u2013but it was hard to dislike a character I felt so much pity for.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for an author\u2019s writing to cut through all of the character\u2019s negative qualities in the way Erikson did for Felisin. I think of Vin from Brandon Sanderson\u2019s Mistborn series as a prime example for me. Throughout the entire trilogy, I wanted to grab Vin by the shoulders and just shake her, tell her to stop. It\u2019s not that I thought she was a bad character, or not representative of a teenage girl, it was just that her circumstances didn\u2019t convince me.\n\nWith Felisin, every time I rolled my eyes at an immature remark towards Heboric or Baudin, every time I sighed as she lashed out at her companions, the annoyance and contempt I felt was immediately drowned out by pity. She was, and still is as \u201cSha\u2019ik Reborn\u201d, a product of her circumstance. Rape, prostitution, drugs, slavery, violence, betrayal by her own sister, it broke her. And anytime I felt negatively towards her, even the slightest bit, empathy followed, because how could I expect a character like her to behave in any other way.\n\nSo bravo to Steven Erikson for pulling that off. And damn you for killing Kulp and Baudin in such a way as to force the reader to acknowledge their insignificance in the world. Especially Baudin and his belief that he would be immune to the fire\u2026 I mean, how could he not believe so after being roasted by an undead dragon?\n\nI assume the Silanda\u2019s time stasis effect has something to do with the crew\u2019s survival and not their near ascendancy. Though I\u2019m sure this will be explored\u2013or at least explained indirectly\u2013in a future book. Especially since Gesler, Truth, and Stormy are alive and kicking and looking for Duiker still.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Duiker\u2019s Storyline\n\nWhat can I say besides\u2013***damn***.\n\nI think Duiker was my favorite character in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed his philosophical monologues and seeing the Chain of Dogs through his eyes. His limited interactions with Coltaine gave me just enough insight into the Fist\u2019s character to keep his veil of mystery alive, as if he were ascendant himself\u2026 well turns out he\u2019s near ascendancy as well, big surprise.\n\nUnfortunately, the Chain of Dogs plotline didn\u2019t quite do it for me while reading, as it was a bit of a slog to get through at times. It felt too deus ex machina at times (which is par for the course for Malazan) and as someone who lives in a desert, it seemed like the caravan was just able to go on a bit too long\u2026 but maybe I say that because I would have died just outside of Hissar from dehydration.\n\nBut that\u2019s also why I think the Chain of Dogs is such a beautifully written storyline in hindsight. My lack of love while reading is actually the reason I love it now. As we follow Duiker from Hissar to Aren, we are beaten down emotionally. Every turn, Duiker was experiencing a new low, a new horror greater than the last, more blood, more death, starvation, dehydration, exhaustion, hopelessness. It was a constant. And it numbed me as the reader just as it numbed Duiker.\n\nIt\u2019s something I realized only after I finished the book and thought back on it. It was a slog to read through because I was apathetic. I was simply reading the same events played out over and over again. And while I was prepared for Coltaine and Duiker to die, I still held out hope that there would be some miracle to save them. But no one saved Coltaine\u2026 Well, except for Squint given the ending, but more on that later.\n\nThen Duiker was killed and I hoped the gift meant for Coltaine would at least save him but alas, all awareness ceased as he hung from that tree. My only solace in Duiker\u2019s death is the scene with Irp and Rudd where they discuss his soul being trapped within the glass and needing to recover Duiker\u2019s mortal body. Though I suspect my solace won\u2019t last long as the world of Malazan is horrid and unjust. Perhaps a true death would have been mercy for Duiker.\n\nAs for Coltaine\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d, I assume he will become Soletaken (or maybe D\u2019ivers, but I assume a D\u2019ivers is created differently than Soletaken?). While I don\u2019t know how much of a role he will play in the coming books, if at all, I can certainly say that whether he truly died or will yet live, I am content in both. His goal was to deliver the refugees to Aren and in that, he won.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Mappo\u2019s Storyline\n\nWhile this wasn\u2019t my favorite storyline in the book, I loved the duo. I felt more emotion for Mappo\u2019s desire to save Icarium and his grief than the other characters. I just love these types of relationships. I felt such a deep pity at Icarium\u2019s loss of memory of the book\u2019s events and felt grief at Mappo\u2019s lies to keep their relationship strong. How sad is it that they have such a pure and real love for each other but Icarium is blind to it and Mappo cannot fully embrace it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fiddler\u2019s & Kalam\u2019s Storyline\n\nFiddler, Crokus, Apsalar, and Kalam\u2019s storylines were the cornerstone of the book for me. They are what connected Deadhouse Gates to Gardens of the Moon, and thus to Memories of Ice (which I have started last night). They kept the world familiar as I explored a new continent and delved deeper into the mysteries of Malazan. I\u2019m disappointed, and surprised, that Fiddler isn\u2019t joining the Bridgeburners, instead choosing to fight in Seven Cities. I\u2019m hoping to see him more soon. Also hope that I get more Kalam, Apsalar, and Crokus\u2026 but maybe I shouldn\u2019t since no more writings on them would mean they lived happily ever after\u2026 right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Random Thoughts\n\n**Ascendancy** \\- I was left with many questions about ascendancy during Gardens of the Moon but it\u2019s starting to make more sense now, especially since we\u2019ve found out who Shadowthrone and Cotillion are. One point of confusion was whether or not Ascendants were the gods themselves but after Deadhouse Gates, it doesn\u2019t seem so cut and dry. It seems to me that Ascendants and gods have the same relationship as rectangles and squares where the gods are Ascendants\u2013or at least *were*\u2013and Ascendants are those with the prerequisite to becoming a god. In other words, simply powerful and immortal beings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**T\u2019lan Imass** \\- We got much more information about the Imass in this book. I believe GotM had mentioned they were once mortal but I can\u2019t remember if that was expanded upon in Deadhouse Gates. There was also the topic of how the Empire was controlling them and that the control had been lost. In Deadhouse Gates we see the appearance of T\u2019lan Imass on the Silanda as well as the undead dragon that seemed to have caused the near Ascendancy of Baudin, Gesler, Truth, and Stormy.\n\nUntil then, I was under the impression that the Imass were more of a mindless entity after becoming undead long ago and that Ono O\u2019toole in GotM was unique in his thoughts. But now it is obvious that they still play a vital role in the world and likely still have self-determination.\n\nIt was also mentioned in GotM that the T\u2019lan Imass were the true creators of the first empire (not to be confused with the First Empire named in the books and the ruins of it found in Raraku) and it was implied the Imass take offense to the Malazan\u2019s claim of the title.\n\nI\u2019ve become much more interested in the Imass, especially since we have been introduced to a living Jhag, even if only half Jhagut. We also see the relationship between the Jhagut and T\u2019lan Imass during the visions List has during their approach to Aren. Can\u2019t wait to learn more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First Empire** \\- As mentioned above, it\u2019s not truly the first empire and thus is not deserving of the title as far as the Imass are concerned. It was great seeing the ruins in Raraku and how Soletaken and the magic of the world was understood much differently in the past. It makes the current timeline feel like a sort of dark ages in terms of knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Warlocks & Warrens & Holds** \\- I\u2019m glad we were able to see yet another form of magic, this time in more of a spiritual form. There was mention at some point that in the past, mages drew their powers from within themselves rather than from a Warren. There was also the mention of Holds as the predecessors to Warrens and Houses. While I\u2019m uncertain of the significance of it, it follows the theme of hidden past knowledge and the substantially more powerful beings that seem to be from the past more than from the present.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Death** \\- I love that death isn\u2019t really final in Erikson\u2019s world. Not only as a way to create conflict from a story perspective or to keep suspense but because it follows the recurring theme of interference. Paran, Tattersail, Duiker, Coltaine, all people who have died but aren\u2019t really dead. In all cases, there are those who have interfered with their deaths, whether it was a god, the natural order of things, Quick Ben (what is the damn vial?! I need to know more), or some unknown force in play. Not only does it keep me guessing and hoping, but it gives such depth to the world. And Erikson has executed phenomenally thus far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shadowthrone & Cotillion** \\- I\u2019m glad they don\u2019t feel purely evil. And I\u2019m not able to determine how Ascendancy has changed their personalities if at all. While their comrades, Dujek, Whiskeyjack, and so on have revered them as not only competent leaders, but friends as well, it\u2019s hard to tell if it is due to rose-tinted glasses or not.\n\nFrom the characters\u2019 perspectives, these Ascendants led noble\u2013even if harsh in their rule. But as the reader, we only see them as Shadowthrone and Cotillion, ruthless and violent. Shadowthrone has given Fidder, Apsalar, Crokus, Rellock, Kalam, and Minala what they wished (though the latter with some extra baggage) but it seems obvious that there is some catch that comes with his generosity. Unfortunately, I will have to wait and see but I look forward to uncovering their motivations and objectives.\n\nThere seems to be some sort of ongoing relationship between Azath and High House of Shadow. I wonder if Shadowthrone and Cotillion plan on using the power of Azath in some way, which would explain why they wanted to feed Soletaken, D'ivers, and Icarium to it. I expect we will learn more soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reveals & Twists** \\- I noticed that Erikson has two types of reveals in this book: reveals for the reader and reveals for the characters. Sometimes in the latter, the reader also does not know the information. I simply thought this was interesting. I\u2019m so used to big, impactful reveals and twists, aimed directly at the reader. One example being the reveal of Heboric and Felisin under the gates where Leoman and the Toblakai awaited. In fact, this reveal reminds me much of Brandon Sanderson\u2019s prophecy at the end of Mistborn Book III, >!where Sazed realizes the prophecy referred to himself (something about the bracelets on his wrist, too long ago to remember exactly)!<. Perhaps there was some inspiration there from Heboric\u2019s part in Sha\u2019ik\u2019s prophecy, *delivered unhanded*. Anyway, I digress.\n\nThe other type of reveal is for the character and the reader together, for example Fiddler\u2019s and Kalam\u2019s realization that Shadowthrone and Cotillion were Kellevand and Dancer respectively. It\u2019s much more subtle in a way, as it feels so much more natural. It keeps with the theme of being thrown into this writhing world full of mystery. Even the reveals aren\u2019t necessarily meant to the reader. Just something I found interesting while reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nThere is so much more to say but I don\u2019t have time to write it all down. 272,000 words, according to Wikipedia, a long read. And as dense as Steven Erikson writes, it would take plenty of other authors 400k+. At 358k, the next one is going to take a while and I will enjoy every step of the way.\n\nNow, on to the next! Who will die this time? :("

        "body": "**Why is this mostly all-star hard mode?**\n\nBecause I read 70+ books this year and in a majority of cases, I tried to put the best books in the bingo slot. However, there were a couple slots where I only read one book and I put it in whether it was good or not. There is also one slot where I\u2019m reviewing my easy mode turn in because the book I read was worse than the book I previously reviewed on my easy mode bingo, which you can find [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/z3ayv7/first_completed_bingo_card_of_the_year/)\n\n**Row 1**\n\n**LGBTQIA: Karen Memory By Elizabeth Bear**\n\nGreat Weirdwest/Steampunk novel. Karen Memery (like memory only spelled with an e) is a teenage prostitute in 1878 alt-Seattle, whose life becomes complicated by the arrival of a serial killer and a rival pimp's attempt to run for mayor aided by a steampunk mind control device.\n\nThis book does an excellent job of portraying a young woman (16) who is an adult in many ways yet still manages to read young at other moments. It also does a good job of portraying a diverse cast while portraying the time and place in a believable fashion.\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of historical settings where the characters seem like moderns in whatever century dress, particularly younger characters. The fact that this book avoids doing that made this one of my top reads of the year.\n\n**Weird Ecology: The Far West by Patricia C. Wrede**\n\nThird of the Frontier Magic series. The series reads like \u2018Wizard\u2019s House on the Prairie\u2019 and is very different from Karen Memory while touching on approximately the same time period.  The weird ecology of this alternate America involves mammoths, terror birds, medusa lizards who do exactly what they say on the tin, and multiple types of dragons. In universe, this is the reason the ancestors of Native Americans are implied to have either have died or retreated back to Asia. It\u2019s also why nobody has made it back from the Rocky Mountains alive and sane (including an alt Lewis and Clark expedition) and why this alt-America, called Columbia, has barely settled further than the Mammoth/Mississippi Rivers.\n\nThe book covers an expedition to the Far West, both build-up and implementation, through the eyes of Eff Rothmer, assistant to a Professor and daughter of another. One aspect of the book I found novel is that Eff is a relatively well-adjusted member of her society, which, when you think about it, is rather novel.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable end to a YA series.\n\n**Two or More Authors: The Mythic Dream Edited by Dominik Parisen and Navah Wolfe**\n\nLike many people on hard mode, this became my second short story square. I read one short story at a time between my other novels. This is a very good anthology about mythic retellings. Favorites were \"Florilegia; or, Some Lies About Flowers\u201d by Amal El-Motar, which is the Blodeuwedd story from her PoV, and \u201cBuried Deep\u201d by Naomi Novik, about the close sibling bond between Minotaur and Ariadne.\n\n**Historical SFF: Harbinger of the Storm by Aliette De Boddard**\n\nSecond book in the Obsidian and Blood Series. Again it follows Acatl, High Priest for the Dead, as he deals with threats to the Mexica (Aztec) Empire, specifically, the fact that the Revered Speaker\u2019s death has allowed Star Demons that want to eat the Fifth World in, and they are reacting much faster than expected. Yes, this is a world where all of Aztec Mythology is true, and it\u2019s 1483.\n\nI liked it, but not as much as the first in the series due to less family drama from Acatl and his siblings. Family drama is so much fun in fictional characters.\n\n**Set in Space: Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine**\n\nSecond book in the series starts with Mahit Dzmare back home on Lsel Station and in the dog house with the more conservative parts of her government. Three Seagrass is still in Teixcalaan and decides to assign herself a request from the military and allow herself to recruit Mahit while en route to the front. It\u2019s evident that the aliens they\u2019re facing communicate. The military commander wants someone from the Information Ministry to try to initiate first contact.\n\nWhat follows is much about being part of an In Group/Out Group, a pretty interesting communication puzzle, and some very personal consequences for various characters. This does a great job of threading the needle between hopeful and depressing and is definitely worth your time.\n\n**Row 2**\n\n**Stand Alone: The Kaiju Preservation Society**\n\nMy first with Scalzi. Nice light read set during the covid lockdowns and having politically connected individuals. Then there are Kaiju, interdimensional travel, and a rather generic main character with a deliberately sexually ambiguous name, Jamie. Enjoyed and especially enjoyed Scalzi\u2019s after-novel comments.\n\n**Anti-Hero: Half a King by Joe Abercrombie**\n\nPerfectly enjoyable Norse-inspired book about a son who is not supposed to inherit because he is a cripple and then becomes King. He is just as quickly overthrown and left for dead and then goes into full revenge mode while reduced to being a galley slave. I knew I could count on Joe Abercrombie to fill this square (one of my problems with the hard mode was not trusting the recommendations to give me an actual Anti-Hero). But YA is not his strong suit. I\u2019d rather hang around with Glockta.\n\n**Book Club: Hollow Kingdom by Kira Jane Buxton**\n\nDomesticated corvid centric view of a Zombie Apocalypse. ST, short for Shit Turd, having picked up his human\u2019s penchant for foul language, and Cheetos gives him a lot of character, which we see developing as he first tries to save his human and then starts to deal with the animal-dominated world that is emerging.\n\nThis was, at times, very touching and imaginative, and it left me looking forward to the sequel.\n\n**Weapon: The Thief Who Wasn\u2019t There My Michael McClung**\n\nBook 3 of Amra Theyts ended with her not-so-beloved hometown saved, but Amra imprisoned outside reality. All she has to do to escape is grasp the blade that whispers hate, something she steadfastly refuses to do. However, the blade has all of eternity for her resolve to weaken. Meanwhile, her lover, the Mage Holgren, takes over the castle she vanished from, which just happens to be the seat of the previous government (imagine an archmage squatting in the White House). This is a lot of fun because Holgren is so fixated at first on his own goals he doesn\u2019t notice or care at first that he\u2019s set off a civil war.\n\nIf I were short on anti-heroes, he would be perfect.\n\n**Revolutions and Rebellions: Witchy Winter by DJ Butler**\n\nThis second book in the Witchy series concentrates on Sara Calhoun, who has declared herself as Sara Penn, is vying for the throne of Cahokia, all the while opposed by her Uncle Thomas, Emperor of America. He is being backed/corrupted by the former Lord Protector of England, the undead Necromancer Oliver Cromwell. And that\u2019s just one thread in this multilayered alt-history flintlock fantasy.\n\nReviewed Book 3 on my easy mode card in more detail. I am very much looking forward to finishing the series.\n\n**Row 3**\n\n**Name in Title: Calico Thunder Rides Again by TA Hernandez**\n\nYes, Calico Thunder is the full name of an aging circus dragon in the Strickland Circus. Jake Strickland, somewhat reluctant owner of his late father\u2019s circus, finds out his father incurred a debt to a mob boss in this 1920s-inspired setting where magical potions made from the parts of dragons and hippogriffs and other such beasties, but illegally under prohibition. This was one of my favorite reads of the year, partly because the odds seem so stark throughout the book, and the victory at the end is that much sweeter.\n\n**Author Uses Initials: Nettle & Bone by T. Kingfisher**\n\nMarra is not the princess who marries the prince. She is the one who kills him when he endangers her older sister. In this quest, she is joined by a dust witch, a fairy godmother, a demon chicken, and a warrior named Fenris.\n\nKingfisher is a comfort read, except when she writes horror (which is freaking disturbing), though Marra reminds me of her other heroines a lot. Not a bad thing because you know what you\u2019re getting, but if you\u2019re looking for originality, this isn\u2019t the place.\n\nIn tone, this book resembles nothing more than a distaff, family-focused version alternative to the Princess Bride IMHO. So yes, I quite liked it.\n\n**Published in 2022: Wake The Bones by Elizabeth Kilcoyne**\n\nPerfectly okay book about college-aged angst and vegetable-based horror that is probably somebody else\u2019s favorite. One thing I did like was the angst of the gay redneck character who is trying to come to terms with having both of those things be a part of who he is. But overall, a solid meh.\n\n**Urban Fantasy: Chapel of Ease by Alex Bledsoe**\n\nFourth book in his Tufa series centers around the production of the off-Broadway show *Chapel of Ease.* The death of Ray Parrish, its writer and composer, and his friendship with Matt Johassen, the lead in the show, and his offer to return the ashes to his family lay out the plot, which takes place equally in New York and Tennessee. Note that Ray is a Tufa, a descendant of the Tuatha De Danaan, so things become interesting.\n\nThe Tufa series has been one of my favorites of the last two years, and this is no exception.\n\n**Set in Africa: Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter**\n\nPerfectly okay portrayal of a vaguely African culture that is fighting for its survival but is still a generally classist awful place. This book didn\u2019t do it for me, yet I could recognize its quality. One dynamic I did enjoy was the internal politics of a nation that has lost a war but hasn\u2019t yet surrendered, which is a dynamic we do not see very often.\n\n**Row 4**\n\n**Non-Human Protagonist: Ancillary Mercy by Anne Leckie**\n\nFleet Captain Breq/Justice of Torrance protects the system she is assigned and all the AIs and sentients within that space. This book feels like a continuation of Ancillary Sword in a lot of ways as she (everyone is a \u2018she\u2019 in this universe) looks for the best way to stick it to the \u2018Man\u2019 Anaander Mianaai, whichever personality shows up. Her solution to the larger problem is solved in a way that is logical and reasonable, and good, though I was annoyed at the introduction of a character who reminds me of Jar Jar Binks. If you enjoy original space operas, this is a series for you.\n\n**Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey: The Space Between by Macaiah Johnson**\n\nMultiverse Travel is possible, but only to worlds where your counterpart is already dead. That\u2019s what makes Cara useful. In the 350+ worlds where Cara was born, she is dead in the vast majority of them. That doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t ghetto trash, but she\u2019s useful ghetto trash with a chance to rise in society. This is a book about the possibilities of how different we can be, as Cara encounters alternate versions of herself and others, about intrigue and navigating power structures and plenty of twists and turns. It is a book that I couldn\u2019t wait to turn the page and felt I never knew what would happen next. Highly recommended.\n\n**Five Short Stories: Unfettered Vol II, Edited by Shawn Speakman**\n\nAn excellent anthology by a lot of big-name authors to raise money for the healthcare of aging authors. While there were several standout stories, my favorite was Magic Beans by Django Wexler, about a sex-powered interdimensional travel machine. Considering Wexler was a c- minus list author in my mind after one read (for last year\u2019s bingo) before coming across this story, this is proof that anthologies are great for introducing us to authors in ways we wouldn\u2019t have expected. I am now on the second book of his middle-grade series,\n\n**Mental Health: Chasing the Dragon by Nicolas Kauffman**\n\nGeorgia Quincy is the last in a line of dragon hunters going all the way back to St. George. Chasing the dragon, who has names like Tiamat and Jormungandr and is essentially the primal chaos that will destroy the world, has destroyed her family, her relationships, and hopes and left her a stressed-out husk of a woman who has turned into a heroin addict. Thus she is chasing another dragon as well.\n\nThis novella is essentially a wild west shoot-out with the complication that the MC is a drug addict, which is portrayed very well and is tied to the final solution of the storyline.\n\nEnjoyable.\n\n**The Nothing Within by Andy Gielser**\n\nThis is the Amish-descended, post-apocalyptic world I didn\u2019t know I needed. Giesler does a great job of creating a low-tech world descended from our world, lain out in a very believable way and shaped because a disproportionate number of the initial survivors are Amish, something we see through the journal of Ruth Troyer. The present-day story centers on Root, the viewpoint character, who tells the story of part of her life and what she has learned about how the world came to be.  In a world that values tradition and conformity, she is questioning and also blind, with signs that something sets her apart that she struggles to understand, avoiding the \u2018not like other girls\u2019 trope and making her a believable person of her time and place. Along the way, there are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.\n\nOverall this book comes across as unique and refreshing, yet also very humble, which makes it one of my favorite reads.\n\n**Row 5**\n\n**Award Finalist: Legacy of the Brightwash by Krystle Matar**\n\nSecond place in SPFBO7 and in the alternate world where I was the judge, it would have won (and yes, I read the winner). The book follows (mostly) Tashue Blackwood, an enforcement officer for the Authority that regulates the magically gifted in this Gaslamp Dystopia. What strikes me about this book is how rich it is, like dark chocolate. Tashue believes in the system initially to the point where he has arrested and jailed his only son but also visits him in prison. As he begins to question, we see friendships, romances, and loyalties portrayed in beautiful detail in a world where they are important yet also disdained by the powerful, which is realistic.\n\nOverall, it is about family, both the chosen and the blood type.\n\nIn this way, the best comparison to it in quality and tone is Jade City by Fonda Lee.\n\nThis is my favorite read of all fifty books I\u2019ve read for book bingo.\n\n**BIPOC: Trail of Lightning by Rebecca Roanhorse**\n\nThis square was my hardest to fill, and I had two false starts (one bloody awful book, another still sitting on my TBR). This was my only reread this year, and I remember liking this series but not being impressed with Black Sun. So I was wondering how well this would hold up.\n\nAnswer is quite well.\n\nMaggie \u2018Monsterhunter\u2019 Hoskie is a compelling protagonist who is hunting a monster related to the monster that helped make her the anti-social loner she is at the start of the book, which is always fun. Coyote fills the reader with a beautiful dread and is probably my favorite portrayal of a trickster god/spirit/whatever. It has good not-quite romance, and the post-apocalyptic Indian reservation (that I\u2019ve visited and feels haunted) is a great setting.\n\nThis is Urban fantasy without the urban, and very good.\n\n**Shapeshifters: The Skin by JE Hannaford**\n\nMy picture is for Charles De Lint\u2019s Jack the Giant Killer which I reviewed in my easy mode reviews. I switched it to my hard mode and am putting this on my easy mode card. Simply, I felt the De Lint book was better.\n\nBut this book deserves to be reviewed.\n\nSo its demotion hints that this is not my favorite book, and you would be right. It\u2019s not a bad book. For me, the post-apocalyptic selkie main characters reads too much like 21st-century suburban YA\u2019s for my taste. It\u2019s also an ecological novel where the knowledge of ecology seemed lacking (the fact I\u2019m writing an ecology-based fantasy has nothing to do with it).\n\nThat said, this book, I\u2019m sure, is somebody\u2019s bucket of fish.\n\n**No Ifs, Ands, or Butts: Moon Over Soho by Ben Aaronovitch**\n\nSecond of the Peter Grant/Folly mysteries. Truthfully, this series has become one of my go-to comfort\n\nreads that I know I will like. They don\u2019t blow me away, but they are dependable.\n\nIn this book, Peter is examining the death, then a pattern of deaths of jazz-musician in the Soho district\n\nof London. Motivation and insight are added due to Peter\u2019s dad being a jazz musician. Readers will put\n\nthe pieces together fairly easily. Yet the sympathetic villains complicate the resolution.  This is also the\n\nfirst time we see the Faceless Man onscreen, so to speak.\n\nRecommended for anyone waiting for the next Dresden Files or similar ilk.\n\n**Family Matters: Touched By an Alien by Gini Koch**\n\nKatherine \u201cKitty\u201d Kat has just finished a day of jury duty when a \u2018man\u2019 outside the courthouse turns into a winged monster who starts on a rampage, one she stops by stabbing said \u2018man\u2019 with her pen. She is then introduced to Jeff Martini of the Agency, who whisks her off with the other agents, who all happen to be incredibly handsome men dressed in Armani suits.\n\nBluntly, Kitty is the merriest of Mary Sues, and this entire book is a cis-woman\u2019s power fantasy that includes the parents and future grandparents-in-law (fulfilling the family requirement) and has no pretensions of taking itself too seriously.\n\nAs such, it is glorious.\n\n**My Ratings (all 49, not counting the 5 shorts):**\n\nFirst off, I know there is a bias toward recently-read books. It goes with being human.\n\n**S Tier**\n\nLegacy of the Brightwash\n\nThe Nothing Within\n\nThe Space Between Worlds\n\nCalico Thunder Rides Again\n\nKaren Memory\n\nSword of Kaigen\n\nThe Blacktonge Thief\n\nGather Her Round\n\n**A Tier**\n\nSteeplejack\n\nThe Golden Enclaves\n\nThe Red Country\n\nMemory Called Empire\n\nDesolation Called Peace\n\nChapel of Ease\n\nServant of the Underworld\n\nThe Thief Who Pulled on Trouble\u2019s Braids\n\nThe Thief Who Wasn\u2019t There\n\nThe Relentless Moon\n\nHollow Kingdom\n\nNettle & Bone\n\nThe Kaiju Preservation Society\n\nThe Far West\n\n**B Tier**\n\nBeyond Redemption\n\nThe Misfit Soldier\n\nAncillary Sword\n\nAncillary Mercy\n\nPenric\u2019s Demon\n\nRivers of London\n\nMoon Over Soho\n\nJack the Giant Killer\n\nUnfettered II\n\nThe Mythic Dream\n\nWitchy Kingdom\n\nWitchy Winter\n\nTouched by an Alien\n\nHarbinger of the Storm\n\nChasing the Dragon\n\nTrail of Lightning\n\nThe Far West\n\nEx-Heroes\n\n**C Tier**\n\nGravity\u2019s Heir\n\nRage of Dragons\n\nClean Sweep\n\nHalf a King\n\n**D Tier**\n\nThe Boatman\u2019s Daughter\n\nFeral Creatures\n\nThe Skin\n\nWake the Bones\n\nHuman Nature (Part of this may be due to the brain bleach I needed to get the audio version out of my head. Never imitate a timelord badly.)\n\n**F Tier**\n\nI did read 70+ books in the year.\n\nI read probably two books that would qualify for F tier that I didn\u2019t include in this list and won\u2019t name to protect the guilty.\n\nOne had a one-hour blow-by-blow sex scene where we got all the details we don\u2019t have to imagine in a fourteen-hour audiobook and about 35% viewpoint characters checking each other out.\n\nAdditionally, the MCs were the only ones who saw past prejudices and were oh-so-enlightened.\n\nThe second was \u2018bigotry is bad, but all those people I don\u2019t like are stupid, awful, and petty under all circumstances, and completely deserving of your contempt.\u2019\n\n**Other Stats**\n\nGender: 24 female, 23 Male, 3 teams\n\n8 self-published, 4 small press, 38 big five publishers. That said, half my S-Tier is self-published while 3 of 4 of my small press is in C or D tier. I suspect the source of my bias is based on reading many SPFBO finalists and Semi-finalists.\n\n34 out of 50 were books in a series. Eight sets appeared on both my bingo cards. Alex Bledsoe\u2019s Tufa series was my highest-rated series. The greatest fall in quality was Hollow Kingdom and Feral Creatures by Kira Jane Buxton.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kxg0ikrowpa1.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=27b29bf86c058c889780f538a24f3d1d7c8a8bb6"

        "body": "SPOILERS FOR BOTH THE SHOW AND THE FIRST BOOK\n\nI recently reread the first Witcher book, and so I decided to watch the Netflix show just to see how well adapted the stories were. I heard good things about the show and went in with some pretty hefty expectations, especially after reading the book.\n\nHoly shit it's bad.\n\nI've only watched the first season, and man, I'm not impressed. Now I do have complaints about the show as a show such as the shitty art style and the low budget look, but those aren't my major complaints. \n\nMy biggest problem with the show is how terribly they adapted the book. If you don't know, the first Witcher book (The Last Wish) is a compilation of seemingly unconnected short stories, perfect for a tv show adaptation. The main purpose of the book is to introduce you to Geralt and his more infamous adventures. It's Geralt's story through and through. That's one reason why the show wasn't very good. It had 2 other plot lines that you had to follow, which just caused the show to suffer. It added unnecessary complexity to a fairly straightforward book. \n\nWe don't need to know Yennefer's story yet, nor do we need to know Ciri's. \n\nNow here's the thing I'm the most mad about: the misunderstanding of the short stories.\nEach short story has a message, has a point to it, which the showrunners completely missed. Either on purpose to shorten the runtime, or they just didn't get it.\n\nI'll give you an example. In the first episode, Geralt killing Renfri and her gang was justified (if you don't count him magically knowing their plan). He chose the lesser evil and seemingly made the right decision. However, in the book, it's completely different. Geralt slowly figures out Renfri's plan, rather than magically knowing it, and kills her gang at the marketplace. Then, Renfri appears and reveals that they weren't gonna go through with their plan since the wizard wasn't gonna leave his tower either way. So Geralt killed those people for nothing. Geralt getting the \"Butcher of Blaviken\" title in the show was unjustified as he did the right thing, but in the book, it's up left to your interpretation. Maybe he did deserve it, or maybe he didn't.\n\nThe whole message in that story was that you shouldn't choose between two lesser evils, yet that message wasn't in the show. \n\nThis is a problem in literally every episode. Every time they try to adapt the short stories, they completely miss the entire point. The Law Of Surprise episode was the worst, and it's my favorite story from the book. It also doesn't help that you have 2 other shitty plotlines, making it even worse.\n\nWhew, I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just needed to rant."

        "body": " I've been wanting to create this post for months but I never did. I decided to create it now, because even many months later I am still surprised that this series was much better and more faithful than the other two.\n\nWitcher should be an easy adaptation, it has the short stories and then the story, which is actually simple and not very thick books, but the second season of the Netflix series was horrible! You can't practically call the season an adaptation of the books, most of the story was invented and filler and contradicts the plot of the books, if they thought that a single book does not have enough plot for a single season they could have then adapted two books in season 2. They also made up a whole story of Ciri summoning monsters and some obelisks and various other plots, how they turned Francesca and Fringilla into completely different characters that bear no resemblance to the ones in the books, with different personalities and backstories, the Yennefer's actress is good, as are several other actors in the series, but she spent the entire season on an invented plot and I don't know how they will fix her relationship with Ciri, in which both see each other as mother and daughter after she tried kill her (!!!).\n\nRings of Power was also a horrible adaptation, I know it would be difficult to create a story in the Second Age, but the story they created was not good. They for some reason put Isildur together with Celebrimbor at the same time. In an interview, they said that if they followed the books they would have to change the human characters every season, but they could have at least simplified the series then to have just two different periods, the first seasons with the creation of the rings of power plot and then midway through the series, after season 2/3, a timeskip with a new human cast. So you could show the prime of Numenor and then the corrupted version of it and just do a single human cast change. So it would show the passage of time and they would only have two sets of human characters, now they would have to put all the events of the second era in a few years.\n\nAnd they did what most people wanted to be the plot of an entire season, the creation of the rings of Celebrimbor, in a single episode (!!!) for some reason, and they cut pretty much the whole relationship between Sauron and Celebrimbor , which is one of the most important, complex and explored relationships in the books, practically does not exist in the series, all the friendship between them, Sauron convincing him to create the rings and ignore Celeborn and Galadriel's warnings, the fact that they together have become become the most important people in Eregion, how it seems that they traded the most important relationship that was between Sauron and Celebrimbor for Sauron and Galadriel, all their dynamics and relationships that could be explored and developed, the whole history of politics in Eregion that could have lasted one season and be important for the next seasons, I feel that it was cut, less than one episode, why those responsible for the series preferred to invent a relationship between Sauron and Galadriel for some reason (and it is because of them being a woman and a man?).\n\nBut in fact the series had other problems, as it seemed that the plots were very slow and did not move, the best and most fun plot of the series was Celebrimbor with the dwarves. In addition, the whole plot of the Southlands was horrible, all the people who lived in the region called it that, it did not have a name of its own, in addition to the fact that it had no scale, after the village where they lived was attacked by Orcs and the population fled and met in a tiny tavern, they talk to all the survivors in the region (!!!) and then meet with the army of Numenor, the Kingdom seemed tiny.\n\nAnd finally Wheel of Time, the series was not perfect and had several problems, but it was a good adaptation and watching the series it can be seen that those responsible read and knew the books intimately, several (but not all) modifications can be explained to summarize the plot of the books to have the first season only 8 episodes and the series to have in total only between six and eight seasons, because different from the previous series these books are huge, in addition to several of the modifications in the first episodes and in the last episodes were why Amazon told them to cut the first episode in half (it originally would have been two hours) and there was a break of months before the filming of the last episodes because of the coronavirus, where they they lost an actor in this break (Mat) and they had that completely change the footage of the final battle against the Trollocs. Of course the series had problems, as for example Rand was less prominent than necessary for most of the season. So this first season was just ok, but it was a good and relatively faithful adaptation to the books."

Actually scratch that, I think it\u2019s better than Arcane. \n\nVideo game adaptations are in a good place now with Arcane, the Witcher tv show, Castlevania season two, Edgerunners, Dragon age absolution, resident evil and now this. Cannot wait for Nier automata next year. \n\nI barely see it being discussed. Anyone seen it? What were your thoughts?\n\nEDIT: wow people really hated this"

        "body": "SPOILERS FOR BOTH THE SHOW AND THE FIRST BOOK\n\nI recently reread the first Witcher book, and so I decided to watch the Netflix show just to see how well adapted the stories were. I heard good things about the show and went in with some pretty hefty expectations, especially after reading the book.\n\nHoly shit it's bad.\n\nI've only watched the first season, and man, I'm not impressed. Now I do have complaints about the show as a show such as the shitty art style and the low budget look, but those aren't my major complaints. \n\nMy biggest problem with the show is how terribly they adapted the book. If you don't know, the first Witcher book (The Last Wish) is a compilation of seemingly unconnected short stories, perfect for a tv show adaptation. The main purpose of the book is to introduce you to Geralt and his more infamous adventures. It's Geralt's story through and through. That's one reason why the show wasn't very good. It had 2 other plot lines that you had to follow, which just caused the show to suffer. It added unnecessary complexity to a fairly straightforward book. \n\nWe don't need to know Yennefer's story yet, nor do we need to know Ciri's. \n\nNow here's the thing I'm the most mad about: the misunderstanding of the short stories.\nEach short story has a message, has a point to it, which the showrunners completely missed. Either on purpose to shorten the runtime, or they just didn't get it.\n\nI'll give you an example. In the first episode, Geralt killing Renfri and her gang was justified (if you don't count him magically knowing their plan). He chose the lesser evil and seemingly made the right decision. However, in the book, it's completely different. Geralt slowly figures out Renfri's plan, rather than magically knowing it, and kills her gang at the marketplace. Then, Renfri appears and reveals that they weren't gonna go through with their plan since the wizard wasn't gonna leave his tower either way. So Geralt killed those people for nothing. Geralt getting the \"Butcher of Blaviken\" title in the show was unjustified as he did the right thing, but in the book, it's up left to your interpretation. Maybe he did deserve it, or maybe he didn't.\n\nThe whole message in that story was that you shouldn't choose between two lesser evils, yet that message wasn't in the show. \n\nThis is a problem in literally every episode. Every time they try to adapt the short stories, they completely miss the entire point. The Law Of Surprise episode was the worst, and it's my favorite story from the book. It also doesn't help that you have 2 other shitty plotlines, making it even worse.\n\nWhew, I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just needed to rant."

The characters are all memorable, the story is leagues superior to the actual series it\u2019s based on, and the worldbuilding is *chefs kiss*. It\u2019s almost as good as Arcane last year. Actually scratch that, I think it\u2019s better than Arcane. \n\nVideo game adaptations are in a good place now with Arcane, the Witcher tv show, Castlevania season two, Edgerunners, Dragon age absolution, resident evil and now this. Cannot wait for Nier automata next year. \n\nI barely see it being discussed. Anyone seen it? What were your thoughts?\n\nEDIT: wow people really hated this"

Now I do have complaints about the show as a show such as the shitty art style and the low budget look, but those aren't my major complaints. \n\nMy biggest problem with the show is how terribly they adapted the book. If you don't know, the first Witcher book (The Last Wish) is a compilation of seemingly unconnected short stories, perfect for a tv show adaptation. The main purpose of the book is to introduce you to Geralt and his more infamous adventures. It's Geralt's story through and through. That's one reason why the show wasn't very good. It had 2 other plot lines that you had to follow, which just caused the show to suffer. It added unnecessary complexity to a fairly straightforward book. \n\nWe don't need to know Yennefer's story yet, nor do we need to know Ciri's. \n\nNow here's the thing I'm the most mad about: the misunderstanding of the short stories.\nEach short story has a message, has a point to it, which the showrunners completely missed. Either on purpose to shorten the runtime, or they just didn't get it.\n\nI'll give you an example. In the first episode, Geralt killing Renfri and her gang was justified (if you don't count him magically knowing their plan). He chose the lesser evil and seemingly made the right decision. However, in the book, it's completely different. Geralt slowly figures out Renfri's plan, rather than magically knowing it, and kills her gang at the marketplace. Then, Renfri appears and reveals that they weren't gonna go through with their plan since the wizard wasn't gonna leave his tower either way. So Geralt killed those people for nothing. Geralt getting the \"Butcher of Blaviken\" title in the show was unjustified as he did the right thing, but in the book, it's up left to your interpretation. Maybe he did deserve it, or maybe he didn't.\n\nThe whole message in that story was that you shouldn't choose between two lesser evils, yet that message wasn't in the show. \n\nThis is a problem in literally every episode. Every time they try to adapt the short stories, they completely miss the entire point. The Law Of Surprise episode was the worst, and it's my favorite story from the book. It also doesn't help that you have 2 other shitty plotlines, making it even worse.\n\nWhew, I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just needed to rant."

I decided to create it now, because even many months later I am still surprised that this series was much better and more faithful than the other two.\n\nWitcher should be an easy adaptation, it has the short stories and then the story, which is actually simple and not very thick books, but the second season of the Netflix series was horrible! You can't practically call the season an adaptation of the books, most of the story was invented and filler and contradicts the plot of the books, if they thought that a single book does not have enough plot for a single season they could have then adapted two books in season 2. They also made up a whole story of Ciri summoning monsters and some obelisks and various other plots, how they turned Francesca and Fringilla into completely different characters that bear no resemblance to the ones in the books, with different personalities and backstories, the Yennefer's actress is good, as are several other actors in the series, but she spent the entire season on an invented plot and I don't know how they will fix her relationship with Ciri, in which both see each other as mother and daughter after she tried kill her (!!!).\n\nRings of Power was also a horrible adaptation, I know it would be difficult to create a story in the Second Age, but the story they created was not good. They for some reason put Isildur together with Celebrimbor at the same time. In an interview, they said that if they followed the books they would have to change the human characters every season, but they could have at least simplified the series then to have just two different periods, the first seasons with the creation of the rings of power plot and then midway through the series, after season 2/3, a timeskip with a new human cast. So you could show the prime of Numenor and then the corrupted version of it and just do a single human cast change. So it would show the passage of time and they would only have two sets of human characters, now they would have to put all the events of the second era in a few years.\n\nAnd they did what most people wanted to be the plot of an entire season, the creation of the rings of Celebrimbor, in a single episode (!!!) for some reason, and they cut pretty much the whole relationship between Sauron and Celebrimbor , which is one of the most important, complex and explored relationships in the books, practically does not exist in the series, all the friendship between them, Sauron convincing him to create the rings and ignore Celeborn and Galadriel's warnings, the fact that they together have become become the most important people in Eregion, how it seems that they traded the most important relationship that was between Sauron and Celebrimbor for Sauron and Galadriel, all their dynamics and relationships that could be explored and developed, the whole history of politics in Eregion that could have lasted one season and be important for the next seasons, I feel that it was cut, less than one episode, why those responsible for the series preferred to invent a relationship between Sauron and Galadriel for some reason (and it is because of them being a woman and a man?).\n\nBut in fact the series had other problems, as it seemed that the plots were very slow and did not move, the best and most fun plot of the series was Celebrimbor with the dwarves. In addition, the whole plot of the Southlands was horrible, all the people who lived in the region called it that, it did not have a name of its own, in addition to the fact that it had no scale, after the village where they lived was attacked by Orcs and the population fled and met in a tiny tavern, they talk to all the survivors in the region (!!!) and then meet with the army of Numenor, the Kingdom seemed tiny.\n\nAnd finally Wheel of Time, the series was not perfect and had several problems, but it was a good adaptation and watching the series it can be seen that those responsible read and knew the books intimately, several (but not all) modifications can be explained to summarize the plot of the books to have the first season only 8 episodes and the series to have in total only between six and eight seasons, because different from the previous series these books are huge, in addition to several of the modifications in the first episodes and in the last episodes were why Amazon told them to cut the first episode in half (it originally would have been two hours) and there was a break of months before the filming of the last episodes because of the coronavirus, where they they lost an actor in this break (Mat) and they had that completely change the footage of the final battle against the Trollocs. Of course the series had problems, as for example Rand was less prominent than necessary for most of the season. So this first season was just ok, but it was a good and relatively faithful adaptation to the books."

        "body": "SPOILERS FOR BOTH THE SHOW AND THE FIRST BOOK\n\nI recently reread the first Witcher book, and so I decided to watch the Netflix show just to see how well adapted the stories were. I heard good things about the show and went in with some pretty hefty expectations, especially after reading the book.\n\nHoly shit it's bad.\n\nI've only watched the first season, and man, I'm not impressed. Now I do have complaints about the show as a show such as the shitty art style and the low budget look, but those aren't my major complaints. \n\nMy biggest problem with the show is how terribly they adapted the book. If you don't know, the first Witcher book (The Last Wish) is a compilation of seemingly unconnected short stories, perfect for a tv show adaptation. The main purpose of the book is to introduce you to Geralt and his more infamous adventures. It's Geralt's story through and through. That's one reason why the show wasn't very good. It had 2 other plot lines that you had to follow, which just caused the show to suffer. It added unnecessary complexity to a fairly straightforward book. \n\nWe don't need to know Yennefer's story yet, nor do we need to know Ciri's. \n\nNow here's the thing I'm the most mad about: the misunderstanding of the short stories.\nEach short story has a message, has a point to it, which the showrunners completely missed. Either on purpose to shorten the runtime, or they just didn't get it.\n\nI'll give you an example. In the first episode, Geralt killing Renfri and her gang was justified (if you don't count him magically knowing their plan). He chose the lesser evil and seemingly made the right decision. However, in the book, it's completely different. Geralt slowly figures out Renfri's plan, rather than magically knowing it, and kills her gang at the marketplace. Then, Renfri appears and reveals that they weren't gonna go through with their plan since the wizard wasn't gonna leave his tower either way. So Geralt killed those people for nothing. Geralt getting the \"Butcher of Blaviken\" title in the show was unjustified as he did the right thing, but in the book, it's up left to your interpretation. Maybe he did deserve it, or maybe he didn't.\n\nThe whole message in that story was that you shouldn't choose between two lesser evils, yet that message wasn't in the show. \n\nThis is a problem in literally every episode. Every time they try to adapt the short stories, they completely miss the entire point. The Law Of Surprise episode was the worst, and it's my favorite story from the book. It also doesn't help that you have 2 other shitty plotlines, making it even worse.\n\nWhew, I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just needed to rant."

        "body": " I've been wanting to create this post for months but I never did. I decided to create it now, because even many months later I am still surprised that this series was much better and more faithful than the other two.\n\nWitcher should be an easy adaptation, it has the short stories and then the story, which is actually simple and not very thick books, but the second season of the Netflix series was horrible! You can't practically call the season an adaptation of the books, most of the story was invented and filler and contradicts the plot of the books, if they thought that a single book does not have enough plot for a single season they could have then adapted two books in season 2. They also made up a whole story of Ciri summoning monsters and some obelisks and various other plots, how they turned Francesca and Fringilla into completely different characters that bear no resemblance to the ones in the books, with different personalities and backstories, the Yennefer's actress is good, as are several other actors in the series, but she spent the entire season on an invented plot and I don't know how they will fix her relationship with Ciri, in which both see each other as mother and daughter after she tried kill her (!!!).\n\nRings of Power was also a horrible adaptation, I know it would be difficult to create a story in the Second Age, but the story they created was not good. They for some reason put Isildur together with Celebrimbor at the same time. In an interview, they said that if they followed the books they would have to change the human characters every season, but they could have at least simplified the series then to have just two different periods, the first seasons with the creation of the rings of power plot and then midway through the series, after season 2/3, a timeskip with a new human cast. So you could show the prime of Numenor and then the corrupted version of it and just do a single human cast change. So it would show the passage of time and they would only have two sets of human characters, now they would have to put all the events of the second era in a few years.\n\nAnd they did what most people wanted to be the plot of an entire season, the creation of the rings of Celebrimbor, in a single episode (!!!) for some reason, and they cut pretty much the whole relationship between Sauron and Celebrimbor , which is one of the most important, complex and explored relationships in the books, practically does not exist in the series, all the friendship between them, Sauron convincing him to create the rings and ignore Celeborn and Galadriel's warnings, the fact that they together have become become the most important people in Eregion, how it seems that they traded the most important relationship that was between Sauron and Celebrimbor for Sauron and Galadriel, all their dynamics and relationships that could be explored and developed, the whole history of politics in Eregion that could have lasted one season and be important for the next seasons, I feel that it was cut, less than one episode, why those responsible for the series preferred to invent a relationship between Sauron and Galadriel for some reason (and it is because of them being a woman and a man?).\n\nBut in fact the series had other problems, as it seemed that the plots were very slow and did not move, the best and most fun plot of the series was Celebrimbor with the dwarves. In addition, the whole plot of the Southlands was horrible, all the people who lived in the region called it that, it did not have a name of its own, in addition to the fact that it had no scale, after the village where they lived was attacked by Orcs and the population fled and met in a tiny tavern, they talk to all the survivors in the region (!!!) and then meet with the army of Numenor, the Kingdom seemed tiny.\n\nAnd finally Wheel of Time, the series was not perfect and had several problems, but it was a good adaptation and watching the series it can be seen that those responsible read and knew the books intimately, several (but not all) modifications can be explained to summarize the plot of the books to have the first season only 8 episodes and the series to have in total only between six and eight seasons, because different from the previous series these books are huge, in addition to several of the modifications in the first episodes and in the last episodes were why Amazon told them to cut the first episode in half (it originally would have been two hours) and there was a break of months before the filming of the last episodes because of the coronavirus, where they they lost an actor in this break (Mat) and they had that completely change the footage of the final battle against the Trollocs. Of course the series had problems, as for example Rand was less prominent than necessary for most of the season. So this first season was just ok, but it was a good and relatively faithful adaptation to the books."

I'll try not to bore you  with a lot of text.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zu0uqsd1aoka1.png?width=3649&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ebee948cb1beeb10e26f4f08e5669aea90d32a3\n\nI originally decided to make the costume based on the classic costume from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.  There was a choice: to make a good, high-quality and detailed costume, or simply buy a sleaze outfit for role-playing games with zippers and a rubber bag from the marketplace.\n\n[Original Triss from the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](https://preview.redd.it/jn20okv9aoka1.jpg?width=1028&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02be192885cab8f83dd027f88cd77be96a818ac9)\n\nWhen tailoring only natural fabrics and materials were used to create a completely authentic look. The vest and bracers are made of natural cotton velvet, the shirt is made of  natural linen. Decorative seams on the chest, gloves-bracers. Handmade zigzags with beads on a velvet vest.\n\n[ the shirt](https://preview.redd.it/rmstl2ahaoka1.jpg?width=2272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60c70b1b799fa87a180c3210badff4a2321aa10d)\n\nThe bag is made to order in the workshop from genuine leather and is absolutely functional. Of course, it is a copy of Triss's bag from the game.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dpogydglaoka1.jpg?width=574&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79bac33680d59f4aea07da9cde1312787503ef89\n\nVest and belts - genuine leather. The vest is vegetable leather, it has an embossed pattern, which gives the desired effect of aging, natural transitions from dark to light. Drawn patterns in my opinion look implausible and reduce the cost of the  product.\n\n[ Process and details](https://preview.redd.it/d1zdllnoaoka1.jpg?width=3645&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=979c127d3101c773fbe4eaabb3793357a74134a6)\n\nAll this happiness came out at 750 euro for natural materials for the costume, processing, embossing, a  bag, etc., 50 euro for a wig, well, plus a photographer of 150 euro.\n\nThis is my third Triss Merigold cosplay. In my opinion it's the most impressive and difficult one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5z4vzstaoka1.jpg?width=2263&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b27f2b9adb7b0dfdfe203e6c6e25c333f06c910\n\nI don\u2019t see the point in writing about the creation of fire separately. In general, anyone who is at least a little familiar with Google will be able to find how to make fire based on soap suds.\n\nThanks for reading. Have a nice day."

I loved every second of, including the two mainline sequels,.PSP games, and even took personal lessons from the 2018 title that had a legitimate impact on my personal life.\n\nEvery time I'm about to do something wrong or morally questionable I hear Kratos' voice say in my head: \"You must be better.\"\n\nWhile there was not as much spectacle as in the previous games, the 2018 title still had enough spectacle to where I could confidently say that what I got was a satisfactory experience and that I had no reason to complain or be upset at all. I 100% love God of War 2018 and nothing will ever change my mind.\n\n\nI'm going to say beforehand that I do not mean to offend or upset anyone. I am not trying to bash this game or crap all over it but I have to be honest about my opinions. While I definitely exist in the minority, I have seen more than enough videos with more than enough views to know that I'm not the only one that has issues with this game. I'm more than willing to clarify my points if that is what's needed, but consider this all to be a stream of thought vomit, as I do not know how to get my points out in a more effective way.\n\nThat said: I hate God of War Ragnarok. I hate it like Kratos hated the Greek gods. I will tell you why, and I really really hope I do not get trollish comments, or dismissive statements condescendingly claiming that I am but a tiny \"sliver.minority\" when all of my research prior to deciding to finally gathering up the will to make a Reddit account and state my opinions has suggested that there has been a lot of secret, subtle, downplayed contempt for this entry. My aim is not to be offensive or disrespectful to the devs, but I genuinely do not believe Eric Williams was the man for the job, and I had a bad feeling about him the moment I heard him speak in an interview. He struck me as a \"Yes man\" to put it lightly.\n\n--\n\nWhy do I hate this game? I'll start in descending order the most most intolerable aspects to ones that I could honestly let go, but still nonetheless regard as bad.\n\n#1 Lack of spectacle: right off the bat, the first chase with Freya is utterly anti-climactic. It is nothing but you steering the sled, and having to mash circle. There are no quick-time events where Kratos so much as has to throw his axe to down a tree, and impede Freya's progress. It is a glorified cut-scene, nothing else.\n\nWhy do I cite this? In God of War 2 we have Kratos riding a pegasus, engaged in full-blown aerial combat. I know for a **fact** that the devs are more creative than this, because this happened during the PLAYSTATION 2 ERA. This is PS5 with a $500 million dollar budget. I understand Kratos would be operating on a defensive mindset, I'm not saying he needs to go ham on her, but there needs to be more happening.\n\nThe Thor fight and bear brawl partly makes up for this, but I largely consider it to be a step down from the Baldur fight. It's just Kratos getting manhandled, and once he finally gets pissed, and we think he's about to lose it against Thor, that's when Thor decides to take off!? Really. He was bitching and groaning about not getting the battle he wanted, and somehow one good knuckle-driver to the jaw is enough to appease his bloodlust, despite him having convinced himself that he is nothing but an instrument of destruction.\n\nThis just reeks of character dissonance. Kratos should have done to Thor what he did to Modi after he punched him into the wall to save Atreus. Kratos should have instilled a reasonable amount of fear, such that his only way out would have been for Odin to show up, and say: \"I think that's enough.\" which not only would have built-up anticipation but would have left us with an even deeper feeling of anxiety as we wonder what the hell happened to Atreus.\n\nSvartalfheim has zero spectacle to speak of at all. There's no big boss battles whatsoever, and I do not count the Dreki because it comes off the same way as the bear did and that is as a mini boss encounter. I appreciate the presence of the Einjerhar but their introduction comes off as cannon fodder and not as the most esteemed warriors of Valhalla that together should be able to give the God of War a run for his money.\n\nNext we go to Alfheim.  You would think that after having experienced what Kratos can do once that the dark elves would have prepared something should he come along and interfere in their business again. He is after all the reason that the light was restored, so not only do they have reason to be prepared for him, they should in addition have reason to hate him because he essentially cost them a war. Contrastingly why on Earth would the light Alps be attacking him when he won them the war? Both sides essentially now look like morons, and it comes at the cost of nothing big or grand happening.\n\nSure we get to release the jellyfish out in the desert, but that is nothing but a measly side quest. Shortly before we get to play through this area, Kratos and Atreus fall into the LAKE OF SOULS and nothing happens. The name alone should tell you enough. The pillar is flickering in and out like a massive cosmic light bulb, so you would think that there would be Souls escaping out into the lake due to the instability of the light pillar. Instead, there's nothing. are you actually trying to tell me that I can take a dip into a lake that has a pillar of light containing all the souls of all the nine realms Plus all of Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Iceland, and by some accounts even parts of the northernmost reaches of Canada. Yes, that's the part of the world Norse Mythology touches, it's not a small region.\n\nIt isn't until Vanaheim that we finally get something spectacular, that being the Nidhog fight. This was good, finally something cool to offset the fact that this realm looks more like the Amazon Fucking Rainforest or Shangri La than anything even remotely Norse. I get it the realms have to look different otherwise the game becomes stale, but all you really would have had to do was swap out the types of trees in Midgard for something else, change the landscape to something flat, meadowy, and y'know -- NORTHERN and you'd have a believably Norse realm. I do not buy this notion that just because this game is the devs take on Norse mythology that they can just do whatever the hell they want and tell us to shut up and accept it when it doesn't make even the slightest lick of sense.\n\nThis is the equivalent of telling a story about Indian mythology and it looking like you are in Egypt. See the disconnect? It's nonsense. There is a range of believability that you can extend yourself to from a visual standpoint until things just start to look incomprehensibly stupid, especially when in God of War 2018 we get a glimpse into Vanaheim and it doesn't look anything like what we are seeing in Ragnarok.\n\nI will say again that I'm not trying to be a jerk here. I get that the devs were just doing their jobs, I get that they have passion and probably believe that they were truly making something incredible, but in my eyes they just weren't. They went buck wild and decided that this game is going to look like whatever the hell they feel like it should look based primarily on whim and not on anything resembling The source material whatsoever. Yes you can alter the source material to look different, but you shouldn't make it look unrecognizable because then what is the point of even picking a specific mythological location to begin with if it doesn't resemble the mythology you are trying to represent in any way?\n\nWant another example of environmental dissonance? Svartalfheim is supposed to be the stinky smelly polluted  realm. Yet I'm apparently able to see 10,000 leagues beneath the Crystal Clear Lake. I'm shocked that there are sinkholes from all the excessive mining done. I'm shocked that the whale we rescued didn't die from inhaling all the \"smoke filled air\", not to mention not drowning since it is a whale that has been submerged under water for hundreds of years,  and whales don't have gills, I'm calling it a whale because the creature is clearly intended to be a whale a whale. There are giant smoke stacks that we have to destroy and yet I'm certain that if Kratos really squinted his eyes he could see into space in OLED quality and wave hello to whatever aliens exist on that realm's version of Mars. \n\nI was hoping that Midgard would have changed in more ways beyond simply being covered in snow. I figured that the world serpent's mass would have displaced enough ice to where there would be fissures we could possibly descend into and explore. Instead we get run of the mill explorable locations that are actually smaller and have less going on in them than the previous game.\n\nHelheim is a joke, and while Garm was great, he doesn't redeem the place, when the goddess Hel -- LOKI'S DAUGHTER doesn't exist, and has been relegated to a title. By the way. Since Hel is apparently the bird, that now means she watched us murder her own son Mattugur Helson right in front of her, and did absolutely nothing. So now we effectively get to have two terrible mothers of the year. Talk about ripping me off.\n\n-- \nCombat: I don't really have much to say other than the fact that I appreciated the elemental buffs you can place onto your weapons. I do not appreciate the fact that we were handicapped to having next to no moves or abilities that took an extremely long time to acquire throughout the game. There are just as many copy pasted and reskinned enemies in Ragnarok as there were in 2018, only it looks worse because the variety of reskinned enemies has now increased, making it that much more apparent to anyone with a set of eyes.\n\nIn GoW 2018 the Leviathan axe combat flowed like water down an immaculately carved river channel. It was a thing of beauty to watch Kratos deathly wield that axe, the weight of the weapon flowing in perfect synchronization with his body. Now the axe swings about 15 to 20% slower than before, it has this weird wobble when you throw it, and though someone told me that the blades of chaos had their reach extended, it just doesn't feel that way to me.\n\nBeing able to jump off ledges and ground slam enemies is a great feeling. I'm not going to lie about that. I have my gripes with this game, it will be a very long time still before I'm able to let go of the wrath I hold toward this abomination, but I'm willing to give credit where credit is due. That was some good shit.\n\nThe Niflheim stuff is a joke, Muspelheim as well, though I will grant that they did manage to freshen up the atmosphere a little bit, it was not enough to make up for much of anything at all. Apparently multipleheim is the land of the fire Giants, meaning that is plural not singular and yet there is only one. His name is Surtur and boy oh boy does he completely fail to give off the presence of anything even remotely mythological or fantastic aside from his skin. He sounds like an extremely dull, boring, 60-year-old, and speaks like you can find him sipping martinis in a ocean front club made for retired old men who are barely on the tipping point of having to use viagra. His presentation was that bad to me.\n\nI don't care that he has a wife, because you don't get to see his wife, you just hear her moaning and sobbing from a distance. You care so much about his wife that he is willing to throw what little he has of his love away just to kill Odin even though his realm and his relationship are not on the line. This wasn't something he was forced into doing, in fact it was something he had every reason not to do, and despite this game being about writing one's own destiny, Surtur decides to just roll with it because as the Fates said \"You're all just so predictable\" meaning that the fates knew Surtur was a spineless cuck incapable of keeping to his own resolved decision.\n\nHe broke his own wife's heart simply because it had to be done even though it didn't actually have to be done. Amazing writing. Truly, that just makes loads of sense. It's like someone took my brain out of my skull and tossed it into a gear machine.\n\n\nInstead of simply keeping the mask for ourselves and using it to aid Atreus' quest to find the other giants, he snaps it in half like a moron simply to spite Odin.\n\nKratos reinforces Freya acting like a real bitch toward Mimir for no reason at all. Remember when Mimir asked her a question about flora, and Freya snidely replied that he should go out and do it himself despite having no arms or legs with which to do so? He politely tries to brush her off her moody jab at him, by saying he was \"Just asking.\" To which Kratos simpishly states: \"And you have been *told*.\" What exactly did this brain dead line accomplish? It basically told us that Kratos is so willing to be there for Freya, that he doesn't have a problem cucking Mimir, the guy he eventually comes to call brother after you defeat all those green warriors. I know this seems like a rather small complaint but it is not in Kratos' nature to be petty like that, let alone reinforce someone else's pettiness in a way that actually counts as an insult toward his own masculinity.\n\nI don't want to get into some rant about the way men should treat women, but I have enough experience to know that when you let stuff like that slide, it doesn't gain you more respect, it makes you lose respect. And God of War diddly damn did I lose respect for Kratos in that moment.\n\nThe character Arc for Thor finally gaining his redemption is rushed, Freya turns into some feminist Queen as she is strangling Odin with the rope that she found on her quest to the utterly disappointing Nornir adventure that turned out to be nothing but a giant cop out."
