If the answer is no, do we have good speculation on the subject?\n\nGeralt runs into Ciri and Yen somewhat frequently and randomly, but he runs into Jaskier at least twice as much. The first two are explained by destiny, but the ridiculous prevalence of the latter, so far, isn\u2019t. This pattern strongly suggests a bond of destiny, and a strong one at that. So... why?"

        "body": "From my Blog: http://fcdisbad.blogspot.com/2020/10/witcher-books-discussion-and-ciri.html\n\nHello Old Friends, today I'll be discussing the Witcher Books naturally. I should say I've only read 6 of them to this point but it was all the narrative ones and the Last Wish (The Lady of the Lake leads directly into the Witcher 3 proper). I bought the Last Wish and Blood of the Elves for my Dad about a year ago and finally decided to read those two myself on a camping trip an the magnificent Pictured Rocks. The Last Wish is fantastic and the rest of the books are like above average fantasy or so, probably slightly worse than someone like Timothy Zahn and nowhere near Gordon R. Dickson's Way of the Pilgrim (it should be noted, Dear Reader, that Science Fiction and Fantasy are the same genre at this point in time, all using similar tropes). Here's a quick ranking of the 6 books I've read (chronology in parentheses), I can only assume the last two would be second and third best since the short story format works much better than an overarching constant cliffhanger style:\n\n1. The Last Wish (First)\n\n2. The Time of Contempt (Third)\n\n3. Tower of Swallows (Fifth)\n\n4. Baptism of Fire (Fourth)\n\n5. Lady of the Lake (Last)\n\n6. Blood of the Elves (Second)\n\nFirstly Blood of the Elves is probably dreadful if you have no frame of reference, even having one it was still unbelievably dull except for the 30% of the book where things were actually happening; it is essentially just a giant fuck-off exposition dump. I was reading the books at this point looking for more elaborations on the world state and so forth and that's the entire book, but even having played the games it was still almost completely dry and uninteresting.\n\nTime of Contempt is a massive improvement, having a fantastic banquet scene followed immediately by the biggest event in the narrative right up until Lady of the Lake; the whole sequence is great and at this point Ciri, the star of the narrative books, is pretty much a flawless, wonderful character. That starts to go awry a bit afterward but I'll elaborate more on that continuously; for now a discussion of Tower of Swallows.\n\nSwallows introduces lots of new elements, aggressive usage of boring, tedious framing devices (the Lady of the Lake is nearly 20% such tripe), and extremely dark violent scenes; pretty much Cormac McCarthy levels of dark. Now that's not to say Andrzej Sapkowski is anywhere near as good a writer as Mr. Cormac; he is a fantasy writer after all (though whoever wrote Hearts of Stone is pretty close to McCarthyism) but that is the tone he's shooting for. At this point Ciri is part of a group of child/young adult bandits called the Rats; under their tutelage she's been raped by a Lesbian who she promptly falls in love with (more on sexual violence shortly) and also becomes a hardened killer; perhaps having killed somewhere around 15 people prior to the start of the fifth book. The Rats run into Leo Bonhart, a not-Witcher Witcher who is basically invincible a la Judge Holden or Anton Chigurh; his motivations are not entirely clear to start with but later he's revealed as a horrible sadist. Bonhart is the second best character from the books, behind the one-chapter Calanthe; neither is even close to Gaunter O'Dimm.\n\nBonhart kills all six of the Rats attacking him from all sides, Ciri shows up to watch her lesbian lover/rapist (for whom the rose on her crotch is tattoo'd) die, then he ties her to a post and decapitates them all in front of her. Great scene, I don't have much more to say about it, speaks for itself. Through the rest of the book he continues to torment her but does grant her the sword Zireael (Ciri's Elven Name Swallow) so she has a fighting chance, at one point she tries to kill herself and he says \"You won't do it, witcher girl. In Kaer Morhen you were taught how to kill, so you kill like a machine. Instinctively. To kill yourself you need character, strength, determination and courage. And they couldn't teach you that.\" Great line, speaks for itself. I envision him sounding like Michael Wincott in 1993's Three Musketeers.\n\nBonhart is sort of Ciri's third parent (or fifth, even sixth if you want to be technical), bringing her back from a relatively evil path to a more Witchery neutral one; he drags her around like a circus act and eventually threatens her with posthumous rape; which she recoils from naturally. Unfortunately Ciri doesn't respond to even mildly offensive sexual encounters negatively; it's only absurdly evil ones (like, say Cannibalism, Science Experiment Cesarean Section, and Necrophilia) that draw her ire. \n\n>!spoiler One need only look at my youtube thumbnails: https://www.youtube.com/user/Fredchuckdave/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid to realize I am not a prude as far as respecting certain parts of the female anatomy and also understanding the nature of sexual violence in the modern world and the perhaps irreparable damage done to the female psyche by thousands of years of such things, as farcical as notions of modern peace and prosperity are amongst robber barons the notion that women will simply cease to enjoy sexual violence almost as much if not more than men is preposterous.!< All of that said I don't think women are \"supposed\" to be that way and I don't think an extremely assertive woman who's killed 50 humans, many in cold blood, would just willingly submit; no matter how pragmatic and intelligent she may be; to repeated unwanted sexual advances.\n\nThis discussion ties mostly into the last book, though I should note her first experience with Mistle is somewhat believable given her state at the time, the scene with Hotspurn less so, and the scenes with the Elven High King downright reprehensible (though oddly her scene with Eredin is perfectly fine, excellent even). Essentially she's stuck in the second Elf World and her only described way out by Avallac'h of Witcher 3 fame is to get pregnant and have a world destroyer god kid, conveniently time is warped so she could still make it back to the present. After like two words of protest she's down for it and has sex with the Elf King three times, he eventually commits suicide due to his inability to inseminate her; what a tragedy (Eredin's involvement is ambiguous in the books, only intentional murder in the games).\n\nIf you've only played the games you may wonder why this isn't discussed at all, not even a little bit. That's because it's terrible on so many levels and utterly preposterous for a character that is effectively the ultimate badass and also a God of Space and Time. But because she's a woman she must willingly submit or something, Ciri is not Aloy levels of intelligent but she's smart enough to realize she can obliterate anyone whenever she feels like it aside from Bonhart, a male writer should theoretically understand the character he fucking invented and not subject her to such primitive chauvinism.\n\nThe other main element the narrative books bring is the gradual assembly of a Dirty Dozen type group for Geralt to hang out with, including Dandelion, Zoltan, and Regis from the games and Cahir (fantastic character), Milva, and Angouleme; they're all great and all reminiscent of any number of scenes from the games when those characters are around. The Dwarves in the books are interchangeably the same character just with like 7 different names so I suppose it's simpler to just think of all of them as Zoltan, but Zoltan is also the brief participant in the Dirty Dozening.\n\nHere we get to the more typically controversial part of the books, the latter half of Lady of the Lake; all the characters show up to save Yennefer and Ciri (who once again through asinine total submission is in peril) from the comically Arch Arch-Villain Vilgefortz and his henchman the fantastic Bonhart and the inept proponent of democracy Steffan Skellen (who gave Ciri her scar with a Shuriken or a Shuriken flail; doesn't really make any physical sense if you think about how he hits her with it and the shape of the scar). And then everyone died; the end. That's it.\n\nI suppose it should go without saying that it is lazy writing to just kill off one major character and then kill off the next one two sentences later, the next a page after that, and so on and so forth; resolving all of your loose ends and confidently saying \"I'm tired of writing these books assholes!\" Kills the dramatic tension, generally an unsatisfying conclusion to a ~1200 page/3 book build-up. There's nothing wrong with characters dying, hell even all the characters dying (though the killer would have to be Eredin and the Wild Hunt for it to work); but the way it's done sort of robs you of any sentimentality by the end; aside from the excellent scenes with Tywin Lannister, err; I meant Charles Dance, no wait Emhyr var Emreis. \n\nYennefer, Ciri, and Geralt emerge from the ruins of the anti-climactic climax and as is discussed in the Witcher 2 Yen and Geralt are killed in a nonhuman pogrom/riot in Rivia (where I'm fairly certain it did not actually all begin despite what the book says). The pogrom is better than the castle sequence and maybe could've worked, but we're in this universe where Yen and Geralt survive and the games happened. The games are better than the books overall (Last Wish notwithstanding) so I feel like Game Canon is superior to Book Canon, debatable though I suppose. I'd be interested to hear the thoughts of early Polish readers since they are by and large the only people who read the books prior to the games existing, but I feel most native English speakers probably feel about the same as me.\n\nGeralt, Yennefer, and Dandelion are all brilliant characters, the Witcher's universe is fantastic and without the books the games would not exist; thus a top 5 game and a top 20 game all time would not exist and a top 2 character in Gaunter O'Dim would not either. So we are indebted to Mr. Sapkowski, no matter how unsatisfying the book conclusion is.\n\nExtended Aside: The next Witcher game (which will sell 10 million copies and is therefore going to happen no matter what) is almost certainly Ciri as Witcher-girl (a frequent enough occurence in the books but only broached right at the end of Witcher 3; Bonhart's Cat medallion notwithstanding), with occasional guest appearances by all your favorite and not dead characters from the previous games. The best way to do this is make like 5-10 individual areas a la the Witcher 2; probably 2 of those being fanciful teleported worlds and the rest being in Temeria/Redania/Aedirn/Kaedwen/Nilfgaard (probably more Nilfgaard this time); somehow finding a way to justify bringing Cahir back to life would work quite well as a conclusive element. Game Ciri is fairly underdeveloped, similar to book Ciri except no catastrophic flaws to this point; but she will probably just wind up being an Androgynous Geralt and semi-indistinguishable from him in the long run."

        "body": "First of all, I liked this series. For the past 6 months it's been in the back of my mind and it's weird that it's now over (I still have to read Season of Storms, but it feels separate). I had started this series as an attempt to get myself to read books for fun, and it worked. I read every day or so for about 2 hours now. The reason I'm including this is because it took me a little while to get into the reading habit at first, and I think that affected how I experienced the books.\n\n\n\n**The Short Stories**\n\nMy biggest regret about reading the short stories was that I read them while I still wasn't super into reading. It took me longer to read the short stories than it took me to read Baptism of Fire, Tower of Swallows and Lady of the Lake combined. I never gave myself the chance to digest them. Because of this, I didn't really get into the short stories and didn't really see why people loved them. Now, knowing what I know about the series and my newfound love for reading, I might go back and read them again to appreciate them more. \n\n\n\n\n**The Saga**\n\nI'm still not sure how I feel exactly about the story of the Witcher. There were many many times where I was confused about politics, geography, and plot. It wasn't until Baptism of Fire that I started to understand the world and the politics a lot better, so I think that retracted from my enjoyment of the first books. It was a lot of reading, but if I didn't like it, it would have been so much harder to get through. I loved the ending chapters of the book, the last few pages where I'm assuming Geralt and Yennefer died, and they mention fallen friends like Cahir and Milva brought tears to my eyes. I like that it wasn't necessarily a happy ending and the philosophy fits Sapkowski's writing perfectly. That being said, I didn't really like the ending/climax of the plot a whole lot. I think it was masterfully written but not my favourite ending to such a long story. I'm not sure what I didn't like about it yet, I'll have to think on it, but it felt like a long build up to a weak climax. I thought Avallac'h and Eredin would make a reappearance, or Ithlinne's prophecy would have something to do with the end, and maybe I expected something more grand and that's why I felt let down. I am also very confused on the very last page with Ciri and Galahad. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed these books and will remember the characters forever.\n\n\n\n\n**The Characters**\n\nThe way Sapkowski writes characters was to me the best part of the series. If the plot wasn't what got me to pick up the book to read the next chapters, it was certainly the thought that I could read for an hour and a half and go on an adventure with the characters I've come to love. My favourites were certainly the gang of Cahir, Milva and Regis, and then the dwarven parties of Yarpen Zigrin and Zoltan Chivay we met along the way. The dialogue was entertaining and fun to read, and felt so real.\n\n\n\n**Favourite Moments**\n\nMy favourite of the books was definitely Baptism of Fire. I read that thing so fast and thoroughly enjoyed every bit. I absolutely loved Geralt's journey with Dandelion and Milva, picking up Cahir and Regis along the way. I loved the chapter in Lady of the Lake with the field surgeons, and the battle between the Northlings and Nilfgaard. I loved the ending of Geralt and Dandelion drinking with the dwarves, and the closure of Geralt and Yennefer's characters. And I loved Sapkowski's philosophy of the human race, the destruction and hatred we hold and the consequences (that's how I interpreted it.) There were lots other things I loved too, but I'll leave it at that. Oh and I really liked the ending of Boreas Mun, Dijkstra and Faoiltiarna.\n\n\n\n\n**The Negatives**\n\nThere were a few things that annoyed me about the books that I'll include here. Sometimes the politics and jumping between timelines and character POVs was hard to follow and it didn't immediately connect in my mind what was happening. I'm very confused about the ending with Emhyr. I knew he was Ciri's father unfortunately because of Witcher 3, but I'm confused why he didn't take Ciri with him. One moment Geralt and Yennefer are about to die in a bathtub, then all of a sudden Emhyr leaves Ciri with them and just heads out. I'll have to look into that more. I wish the Aen Elle played a bigger part in the ending. I know it helped explain Ciri's heritage and importance, but it felt incomplete to me. \n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nEven though I'm critical of the plot, I just want to reiterate that I liked this series a lot and I'm sad it's over. There wasn't ever a part in this series that I thought \"that's unrealistic\" (not that time and space travel is realistic, but that's what fantasy is about), I wasn't annoyed by any tropes that I can remember, and even though I didn't like where he took the story sometimes I absolutely respected what he did. Some of my criticism of the series I think is because I am new to reading for fun and taking in so much information. Now I'm just left sitting here, contemplating this journey I just finished.\n\n\n\nOverall rating 7.5/10 (I could see the score going higher after a re-read)"

Being forced to stay in Aretuza is punishing especially when you consider a magical education normally taking decades to obtain\n* Cares more about smaller details than the larger picture (as seen with her habits)\n* Despite being one of the - if not the - most powerful sorceresses, she does not use her powers in any significant way. She just teaches and (as explained above) she isn't too good at this either. \n\nIs it just me or would the main sorceresses in the book (e.g. Yen, Triss, Phil, Sabrina) be a whole lot more stable, approachable and genuine if it was Margarita who taught them?\n\nEDIT: if you go by the show, she also turns failing students into eels - pretty much condemning them to eternal suffering.

She also doesn't care about the Continent or the issues plaguing smallfolk. Depending on your interpretation of the books, she either murdered her dad leading to her mum's suicide or killed both of them in revenge. She screwed over Istredd (and Geralt initially) and nearly raped a guy in the books (on the Netflix show, she straight up magicked a crowd of people into having sex - i.e. mass rape). \n\nI get that she's meant to be a character with a strong personality but...isn't it understandable why most character in the books, in the games, and in the show don't like her?

Geralt's stories, while changed in some ways still greatly resemble and work like they should from the books and are amazingly brought to life. Plus, what it got wrong in some casting of characters, it excelled where it really mattered, namely Henry Cavill as Geralt, Anya Chalotra as Yennefer, Freya Allen has potential as Ciri, Jodhi May as Calanthe, MyAnna Buring as Tissaia, Royce Pierreson as Istredd, and Joey Batey as Jaskier/Dandelion.\n\nI'm excited to see Season 2 and how they adapt Blood of Elves.\n\n\nBut what do you guys think?

To the point if I were to introduce a friend to watching it, I'd say it only has 7 episodes, and let them miss out on the finale.\n\nBe it talking for the sake of exposition. For example Triss saying \"But there are only 22 of us now!\" Felt so forced and unnatural. Even adding a few seconds of dialogue would fix this... Make them sound like real people. \"Gods help us how the fuck are we meant to hold a fort with only 22 people?\" Or \"Are you seriously considering we hold ground with only 22 of us??\" And have her look annoyed. Not sat in the background spouting exposition.\n\nMakes it seem like something someone would actually say. Not just a direct line towards the audience \"By the way this is 22 mages plus a few farmers against a whole army lol get excited we gonna do some spartan crazy shizzle up in here\"\n\nAll the voiceover Yennefer has, feels like it's there as exposition or to make the visuals more dramatic. Like Tisseia casually walking along. \"Tisseia where are you? We need you, where are you Tisseia, we need you, they've broken through. Youre our only hope *Luke* \" for the sake of hightening drama.\n\n\"Vilgefortz. Save. Your. Chaos.\"\n\n\"Yennefer, save your chaos\"\n\nSome fog enters the gate \"They've broken throughhhhh!!!\" even though there are no sounds of soldiers, or marching vibrating the ground, plus I'm sure every mage there has some \"detect life\" spell up their sleeve for low mana.\n\nSorry this has simply become a rant now. I hope it doesn't break any rules. I could go on and on, but almost every line, or delivery of a line, seems so... wrong? Like in no way how anyone would talk or react. It feels like a student made project.\n\nIs there a reason for this? I can understand a mainly drama-focused director or writer not knowing how to put a skirmish onto film. But even an adept writter would have scrapped a lot of the lines forcibly spoken in this episode. I'm just genuinely confused how it made it through editting with this final product, and have nowhere else but Reddit to ask."

And I knew something was up, but was totally surprised when all hell broke loose the way it did. The twists and turns of chapters 3 and 4, with Geralt just kind of obliviously in the thick of it, made for a truly enthralling read.\n\nThe question of siding with Philippa and Djikstra, or condemning them, then that giving way to the realization of the extent to what Vilgefortz was up to, was quite a ride. And of course there's the enormous stakes of the situation, both on a personal level for Geralt, Yenefer and Ciri, and on a world-wide implications level. And I still don't think Nilfgaard is a clear bad guy against the northern realms (love the shades of grey.)\n\nAnd that's without even talking about the banquet, which was a great prelude to all that, full of interesting conversations. Not sure if I've made much of a point with this post, but these are just my immediate reactions because I'm pretty excited over it right now. Did you all love this sequence as much as I did?"

It may not be the most character focussed novel in the series, but I do think it is the best one at showing just how special Sapkowski's world is.\n\nThe initial breaking of regular fantasy tropes by setting the story in the late medieval period is shown perfectly through the hilarious and recognizable Codringer and Fenn or the Giancardi Bank chapter. Mostly though, the whole Thanedd arc is written perfectly. It is built up slowly using background information established through the series so far and then executed in a brilliantly chaotic mess that, despite us following it with an outsider's perspective, seems completely logical by the end. \n\nWhile I think later books in the series give us more fleshed-out character arcs and stories, it is in Time of Contempt that you realize just why Sapkowski's world is so unique and deserves its place among some of the best fantasy out there."

Now i thought why would he leave it there if not for jaskier. Like certainly he would notice if the solitary coin in the coin purse was no longer there. He also most definitely could have left jaskier in the dust on roach yet he still let him walk by his side. Just thought that was a cute little detail."

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Geralt and Yen's faces are enough to win this episode most underrated\\)](https://i.redd.it/695f6rvbj3q51.gif)\n\n# Yennefer and Geralt at their peak (and their fall)\n\n* It\u2019s all about that romance, baby. We only get a little of it in season one, but this episode packs a full punch. The genre of the episode almost feels like an epic romantic-comedy-adventure\n* **Anya Cholatra** and **Henry Cavill** have so much chemistry together, and those rare moments of them together on screen were the highlight of the season. Getting to see them play off each other and bicker and pine and hurt each other and make up and kick ass together is what I live for. It may not be a one-take action sequence (hi, episode 1) or a barbecued army (hi, episode 8), and it isn\u2019t a culture-defining bard tune or the gory lifting of a princess\u2019s curse (episodes 2 and 3 respectively), all of which were amazing, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that makes the show feel so cozy and lived-in. Beating heart of the series right there\n* Some of the absolute best scene partners in the show. Anya brings out something great in Henry\u2019s performance, and she plays off him incredibly well too. \u201cDo I bore you?\u201d remains the cutest\n* The montage of their past relationship and their conversations in the tent scene were a taste of something I hope we get lots more of in future seasons\n\n# Jaskier in rare form\n\n* Some of his funniest work this season, and easily his most emotionally charged performance\n* **Joey Batey** proves he can have chemistry with literally anyone. Great bratty rapport with Anya\u2019s Yennefer (will he ever live down the crow\u2019s feet line?). The awkward energy between Jaskier, T\u00e9a, and V\u00e9a when he\u2019s trying and failing to flirt. That final scene with Geralt when he gets reamed. Strong stuff in an already strong season full of great Jaskier moments\n* His most underrated (and also my favorite) bard song: [Her Sweet Kiss.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnHgZ3JF8pA) So fucking good. The instrumental version that plays over Geralt and Yen\u2019s tent scene is one of my favorites from the score too. Covers of this song are also highly underrated. [Here\u2019s my favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6TFC3QgaCg)\n* Fun fact: Miss **Haily Hall** wrote the lyrics for this jam [(with just a little help!)](https://twitter.com/drmattdambrosio/status/1253844947649785856?s=20)\n\n# Ciri having a really strong B plot\n\n* Her storyline in this episode is my favorite of hers from the season\n* Baby girl had a knife and knew how to use it. Her conflict with Dara felt earned, and when he left her at the end of the episode, it signaled the promise of something interesting and different for Ciri in episodes 7 and 8. It also made her meeting with Geralt in the finale all the sweeter\n* The Cahir vs Doppler Cahir fight was lowkey masterful, too, packed with so much tension and mystery. The massacre that followed? Gnarly. And Fringilla\u2019s final words to Cahir at the end of the episode are some of my favorites. That whole last scene is understated but so well done. Nilfgaard\u2019s key officers feel representative of an unhinged, unscrupulous, and ultra-powerful force we've only seen glimpses of\n\n# Expanding the scope of the Continent\n\n* This episode gave us a strong sense of kingdoms the show hasn\u2019t visited before and through clever fireside chat, caught us up on imminent political conflicts. This was a smart tease of episodes to come (and thanks to the split timelines, conflicts that have already come to pass)\n* This let us know that Geralt and Yennefer\u2019s storylines were nearing the present timeline, meaning run-ins with Ciri would soon be on the table\n* Zerrikanians T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a were a breath of fresh air as highly-skilled badass bodyguards with a unique perspective on dragons\n* The hunt also gave us our first look at knights and their function in the Continent as monster slayers. Ditto mercenaries (can\u2019t wait to see Yarpen and co. in season 2)\n* Speaking of Yarpen, this episode deserves all the love for finally giving us main dwarven and halfling characters\n* and have I mentioned DRAGONS? And dragon lore? 10/10\n\n# Hirikka (RIP)\n\n* \u201cRare Species\u201d had my favorite monster of the season\n* The hirikka\u2019s mix of CGI and practical effects looked awesome\n* He was innocent, and Ser Eyck deserved to die for murdering this poor, sweet, hungry hirikka\n\n# Kicking ass\n\n* There is a godly amount of ass kicking in this episode and frankly there can never be too much\n* Even Yennefer got to whip out her blades and save Geralt\u2019s butt once or twice. The implication here that sorceresses have weapons proficiency is my favorite thing ever, especially when you think about episode 8 (Sabrina and her bow, Vilgefortz and his swords)\n* Dragons got in on the ass kicking too. Fire breath >>>\n* T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a beheading losers and owning jabronis ranks highly as well\n* Least Valuable Player award: Jaskier for sleeping through it all, poor guy\n\n# Magic and Monoliths!!!\n\n* Aard kiss!!! I know it\u2019s controversial, but I\u2019m firmly in favor\n* Yennefer freezing Yarpen\u2019s company so she could beat them to the dragon eggs\n* Yennefer\u2019s deceptively huge tent\n* THE DRAGON ITSELF\n* The Wish from episode 5 coming to a head with Yennefer finding out the truth and deciding to be done with Geralt once and for all, along with Borch providing a little relationship prophecy for them both. Thanks for breaking our hearts, Borch\n* Dopplers. Creepy serial killer dopplers. Creepy serial killer dopplers who make interesting choices though\n* Monoliths (TWO MONOLITHS, one in each timeline). We don\u2019t learn much about them in this episode, but it feels significant that they\u2019re so prominent. Episode 7 (another super underrated ep) has more on just what they are, which you can read more about [here](https://twitter.com/netflixwitcher/status/1301178556781920256?s=20) and [here.](https://twitter.com/netflixwitcher/status/1288614080899620869?s=20)\n* Such a fun episode for showcasing the practical uses of magic in the Witcher world\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(My closing argument. Your honor, I rest my case\\)](https://i.redd.it/cfgzbfrzj3q51.gif)\n\nAll these reasons together make it my favorite episode and the one I consider most underrated. There are others I love, too, like episode 3, but I think they receive sufficient appreciation. Haily Hall wrote the hell out of this one and **Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m** directed something so fun.\n\nThat said, everyone is going to have their own opinion on this obviously, **so feel free to agree or disagree in the comments \u2694\ufe0f**"

Triss in the games is also accurate because she\u2019s not actually Triss but Lytta assuming Triss\u2019s identity. \n\nFull explanation:\n\nI know many when watching the series complained that Triss wasn\u2019t green eyed and red haired, myself included. However in the books, her canon appearance was brown eye with chestnut hair which would make her accurate for the show. In the books however, Triss is killed in the Battle of Sodden Hill and this is also suggested to happen in the series. There is another Sorceress who does meet the appearance of the Triss we recognize from the games and that is Lytta Neyd. She was also in the Battle of Sodden heal and was mistaken for Triss when healed and was healed to match the appearance of the original Triss. The only remains of her original appearance was her red hair and emerald eyes. It\u2019s then suggested that she took over Triss\u2019s identity because of how close she was to Geralt and used it to her advantage due to her love for him.\n\nAlso, sorry if not flaired properly but I don\u2019t see this as a spoiler so much as an explanation that\u2019s not really covered in the show."

Now, I'm mostly basing this on the leaks, in regards to Yen especially and how it all connects.\n\nIn the books, it's been some years (one or two) after Sodden in Blood of Elves, long enough for them to have erected a monument for the dead sorcerers and for >!Triss to be considered dead !<by many people. Obviously, it's not the case in the show as we'll see Yen a day or so after the battle. Now, I for one am hoping that entire narrative was made up to introduce Francesca and it will be over with in the first episode.\n\nEpisode 2 I think should jump ahead a year or so after Sodden, with Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time now with Geralt, just when Triss arrives. I'm hoping by this time, Yennefer has escaped imprisonment, is healed and >!meets with Jaskier after she saves him from Rience!<, just how the books are. And from there on, no original plotlines follow.\n\nI guess all I'm hoping for is that the plot with Fringilla and Yen as captives is wrapped up as soon as possible and doesn't extend over half of the season.\n\nEDIT: Also, in regards to Triss, I have no idea what they're gonna do there. If they have both Yen and her as missing and considered dead by the world, it's going to feel kind of redundant. Clearly, Geralt thinks Yennefer is dead and from the looks of it, it doesn't seem like he'll climb the hill and find out she's alive, so..."

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just finished watching Witcher on Netflix last night. It was super exciting and I can't wait for the next season. However, I struggle a lot with shows that are lore-heavy as I often miss important details. (I didn't realize there were three timelines until the third episode...) I jotted down notes while watching the show as I had a bunch of questions and confusions.\n\nThese are my summarized notes:\n\n**Geralt:** He is a witcher. Witchers are a never aging species that hunt monsters. His mom was a mage that abandoned him. He is bound by destiny to Cirilla of Cintra after the law of surprise at the banquet.\n\n**Law of Surprise:** How exactly does this work? Its a contract with fate to repay a favor but I do not understand the surprise aspect.\n\n**Cirilla:** Princess of Cintra. Heir to the throne. She can yell loud and stuff breaks. This is a family power according to the Queen. She also killed a bunch of rogue people from Cintra and a horse through some type of possession. There is something special with her which is why Nilfgaard (White Flame) is after her.\n\n**Dara:** Is there any significance to him?\n\n**Cintra:** A powerful kingdom lead by Queen Calanthe. It is attacked by Nilfgaard and defeated. Cintra also slaughtered majority of the elves, creating a large tension between humans and elves.\n\n**Yennifer:** A mage who is \"recruited\" to Aretuza by Tissaia. She is a quarter elf. She definitely has more magical capabilities than the other mages. After failing to save a baby, she quits the brotherhood and goes rogue? I am also confused by her teleporting to Istredd in the beginning.\n\n**Aretuza:** A school for female mages. The head teacher is Tissaia. Mages can not age but are given surgery to turn into adult versions of themselves once they are official mages? They give up the ability to have children in this process.\n\n**Ban Ard:** The male school for mages. Im assuming the head teacher is Stregobor. Is Artorius also a teacher here? And is this school on the same island as Aretuza?\n\n**Brotherhood/ Council :** A group of mages, almost like a police force? Each mage is assigned to a kingdom to make sure there isn't trouble. Mages can also be assigned to do research like Istredd. The ball where Yennifer attends (after receiving her surgery) is the graduation from the magical academies to celebrate each mage going off to their assignments. Mages, sorcerers, witches, wizards are all the same.\n\n**Vilgefortz:** A member of the Brotherhood. He lies to Yennifer in order to convince her to return to the Aretuza for the meeting of the mages. There is definitely something up with him because he seems incredibly strong but lost to Cahir (pretended to be dead) and then killed his friend.\n\n**Nilfgaard:** A kingdom from the South. Originally, they did not have a reputation for strength as Queen  Calanthe laughs them off when they attend her daughter's banquet. They eventually gain strength and go on a spree conquering the Northern Kingdoms. They are led by Cahir.\n\n**Cahir:** The general? of the Nilfgaardian army. Is he a member of their royal family? He is definitely one of the (if not the) mastermind behind their military strength. He wants to capture Cirilla to fulfill the needs of the White Flame.\n\n**Fringilla:** (Snake) Nephew of Artoius. She is assigned to Nilfgaard after the debacle with Yennifer. She starts her own mage school in Nilfgaard, training mages to fight in the Nilgaardian army. Her and Cahir are driven by something called the White Flame. I assume it is an organization?\n\nThis is all. Hope you guys enjoyed my rambling. If I am missing any key details or am wrong about anything, please let me know. Feel free to share any other comments or answers. I really enjoyed the show and just want to make sure I was following along correctly.\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you all for your kindness in helping clarify any questions I had! I just ordered the first four books of the series and am excited to delve deeper into the lore. If anyone else stumbles across this post and has anything else to add or correct, please feel free to do so. I really appreciate it!"

And even after seeing Nilfgaard's army size and capability, she still doesn't give Ciri to Geralt, when he was locked up in the dungeon all this while...why? Did she know of Ciri's \"power\" and was afraid that Geralt will misuse it? This is the part which confuses me."

Yennefer asks when Nilfgaard is supposed to arrive to Sodden Hill and Vilgefortz answers that they\u2019re two days away, smirking the entire time.\n\nNow that same night, Nilfgaardians arrive and attack with fireballs. And when the mages are gathering in the morning after the attack, Sabrina points out it hasn\u2019t been two days yet so how are they already here? It\u2019s Vilgefortz who answers and all he says is that it doesn\u2019t matter. He then proceeds to tell them they can\u2019t wait for \u00a0the northern armies and leads them into the battle.\n\nNow, it could be that I\u2019m stretching things here but it does seem like he mislead them and hoped to lead them into a fight he knew they couldn\u2019t win\u2026 >!all for the sake of eliminating powerful mages of the Northern Kingdoms!<. The next time we see him, it seems like he allows himself to get taken out on purpose. Now obvs, his whole plan of leading the northern sorcerers into a slaughter fails because of Yen, if that was his plan, but the writers didn\u2019t write those small clues into the dialogue for nothing or make Sabrina point out the misinformation he\u2019s given them, which he quickly shrugs off. \n\nSo I definitely think he was already allied with the Nilfgaardians at this point. (Also, I just noticed it which is why I'm posting it but I'm guessing some of the others here have already realized this long ago)."

On monoliths, Istredd says: \"Every glyph has a clue to something across the Continent, from a time before the Conjunction. Most are history, but some might be more. The prophecy, the future, I want to explore all of it.\"\n\n[witchernetflix.com](https://t.co/sSWdSkHonP) notes: \"The monoliths might still hold valuable information about the ancient civilisations that preceded the human race and possibly even the elves.\"\n\nSo, these ancient structures which towns and cities including Cintra have been built around, and which contain clues to the distant past, make mention of our Geralt/Yen/Ciri family - so they're going to relate at least in part to Ciri's destiny. And they're in the books too. Ciri has a slight moment when she touches one in the novel being adapted for the next season.\n\nIstredd has been given more screentime in the show, and he's very specifically been set up as an archaelogist. Nilfgaard are even more interested in the prophecies these monoliths refer to, which is why they're giving him all these resources to excavate a magnalith. So, I think he's going to uncover some very important information, but I have no idea what he'll do with it"

Even in scenes like in the tavern where the characters are just talking, there would be a slight shaking and movement to the scene while the characters would be sitting in the same spot or barely moving from their original position.\n\n\nThen there's shots that have this odd zoom in and zoom out effect like Stregebor and Geralt first meeting, where everytime the shot would switch to the other character the zoom would reset and then slowly zoom back in.\n\n\nAnd there's scenes with weird angles like a tilted bottom up shot.\n\n\nI definitely didn't notice this stuff on my first time watching the show and most of my rewatch has been limited to scenes and episodes that I genuinely liked(definitely does not include any Broken-lon forest or Nilfgaard).\n\n\nBut anyone doing rewatches is gonna look for details and come across stuff like this.\n\n\nI found it weird especially in contrast to Game of Thrones' camera work and cinematography or other high budget, high production value works. Where shots would contain motion to emphasize pace, tension, and time in the movement or action of characters. And any heavy dialogue or \"stable\" settings would have steady and still shots with any tension, pace, and speed emphasized in the dialogue itself. Or zooming out shots to show context, the wider environment, and grandiosity, while zoom-in emphasized details or faces."

We only get a little of it in season one, but this episode packs a full punch. The genre of the episode almost feels like an epic romantic-comedy-adventure\n* **Anya Cholatra** and **Henry Cavill** have so much chemistry together, and those rare moments of them together on screen were the highlight of the season. Getting to see them play off each other and bicker and pine and hurt each other and make up and kick ass together is what I live for. It may not be a one-take action sequence (hi, episode 1) or a barbecued army (hi, episode 8), and it isn\u2019t a culture-defining bard tune or the gory lifting of a princess\u2019s curse (episodes 2 and 3 respectively), all of which were amazing, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that makes the show feel so cozy and lived-in. Beating heart of the series right there\n* Some of the absolute best scene partners in the show. Anya brings out something great in Henry\u2019s performance, and she plays off him incredibly well too. \u201cDo I bore you?\u201d remains the cutest\n* The montage of their past relationship and their conversations in the tent scene were a taste of something I hope we get lots more of in future seasons\n\n# Jaskier in rare form\n\n* Some of his funniest work this season, and easily his most emotionally charged performance\n* **Joey Batey** proves he can have chemistry with literally anyone. Great bratty rapport with Anya\u2019s Yennefer (will he ever live down the crow\u2019s feet line?). The awkward energy between Jaskier, T\u00e9a, and V\u00e9a when he\u2019s trying and failing to flirt. That final scene with Geralt when he gets reamed. Strong stuff in an already strong season full of great Jaskier moments\n* His most underrated (and also my favorite) bard song: [Her Sweet Kiss.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnHgZ3JF8pA) So fucking good. The instrumental version that plays over Geralt and Yen\u2019s tent scene is one of my favorites from the score too. Covers of this song are also highly underrated. [Here\u2019s my favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6TFC3QgaCg)\n* Fun fact: Miss **Haily Hall** wrote the lyrics for this jam [(with just a little help!)](https://twitter.com/drmattdambrosio/status/1253844947649785856?s=20)\n\n# Ciri having a really strong B plot\n\n* Her storyline in this episode is my favorite of hers from the season\n* Baby girl had a knife and knew how to use it. Her conflict with Dara felt earned, and when he left her at the end of the episode, it signaled the promise of something interesting and different for Ciri in episodes 7 and 8. It also made her meeting with Geralt in the finale all the sweeter\n* The Cahir vs Doppler Cahir fight was lowkey masterful, too, packed with so much tension and mystery. The massacre that followed? Gnarly. And Fringilla\u2019s final words to Cahir at the end of the episode are some of my favorites. That whole last scene is understated but so well done. Nilfgaard\u2019s key officers feel representative of an unhinged, unscrupulous, and ultra-powerful force we've only seen glimpses of\n\n# Expanding the scope of the Continent\n\n* This episode gave us a strong sense of kingdoms the show hasn\u2019t visited before and through clever fireside chat, caught us up on imminent political conflicts. This was a smart tease of episodes to come (and thanks to the split timelines, conflicts that have already come to pass)\n* This let us know that Geralt and Yennefer\u2019s storylines were nearing the present timeline, meaning run-ins with Ciri would soon be on the table\n* Zerrikanians T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a were a breath of fresh air as highly-skilled badass bodyguards with a unique perspective on dragons\n* The hunt also gave us our first look at knights and their function in the Continent as monster slayers. Ditto mercenaries (can\u2019t wait to see Yarpen and co. in season 2)\n* Speaking of Yarpen, this episode deserves all the love for finally giving us main dwarven and halfling characters\n* and have I mentioned DRAGONS? And dragon lore? 10/10\n\n# Hirikka (RIP)\n\n* \u201cRare Species\u201d had my favorite monster of the season\n* The hirikka\u2019s mix of CGI and practical effects looked awesome\n* He was innocent, and Ser Eyck deserved to die for murdering this poor, sweet, hungry hirikka\n\n# Kicking ass\n\n* There is a godly amount of ass kicking in this episode and frankly there can never be too much\n* Even Yennefer got to whip out her blades and save Geralt\u2019s butt once or twice. The implication here that sorceresses have weapons proficiency is my favorite thing ever, especially when you think about episode 8 (Sabrina and her bow, Vilgefortz and his swords)\n* Dragons got in on the ass kicking too. Fire breath >>>\n* T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a beheading losers and owning jabronis ranks highly as well\n* Least Valuable Player award: Jaskier for sleeping through it all, poor guy\n\n# Magic and Monoliths!!!\n\n* Aard kiss!!! I know it\u2019s controversial, but I\u2019m firmly in favor\n* Yennefer freezing Yarpen\u2019s company so she could beat them to the dragon eggs\n* Yennefer\u2019s deceptively huge tent\n* THE DRAGON ITSELF\n* The Wish from episode 5 coming to a head with Yennefer finding out the truth and deciding to be done with Geralt once and for all, along with Borch providing a little relationship prophecy for them both. Thanks for breaking our hearts, Borch\n* Dopplers. Creepy serial killer dopplers. Creepy serial killer dopplers who make interesting choices though\n* Monoliths (TWO MONOLITHS, one in each timeline). We don\u2019t learn much about them in this episode, but it feels significant that they\u2019re so prominent. Episode 7 (another super underrated ep) has more on just what they are, which you can read more about [here](https://twitter.com/netflixwitcher/status/1301178556781920256?s=20) and [here.](https://twitter.com/netflixwitcher/status/1288614080899620869?s=20)\n* Such a fun episode for showcasing the practical uses of magic in the Witcher world\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(My closing argument. Your honor, I rest my case\\)](https://i.redd.it/cfgzbfrzj3q51.gif)\n\nAll these reasons together make it my favorite episode and the one I consider most underrated. There are others I love, too, like episode 3, but I think they receive sufficient appreciation. Haily Hall wrote the hell out of this one and **Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m** directed something so fun.\n\nThat said, everyone is going to have their own opinion on this obviously, **so feel free to agree or disagree in the comments \u2694\ufe0f**"

        "body": "Spoilers down below...\n\nSo I was thinking about how certain characters in the show will end up. Lauren did at least confirm she plans to keep the book ending for the show (meaning >!Yen and Geralt die/go to another dimension!< or whatevs) but along the way, there's many other  characters where I'm not so sure.\n\nFor one, Tissaia. We know there was that mentor-protegee relationship between Yen and her in the books but the show made it much more important, in a way. And the way they built up her character, it almost seems like Tissaia >!(who kills herself after Thanedd from guilt)!< won't have the same fate in the show. (Which would suck. I think killing Tissaia off so brutally would be one of the show's more shocking moments and I'd really like to see MyAnna's interpretation of that scene.) Her character wasn't nearly as important in the books as it is in the show. And I don't ever remember Yen reacting emotionally after >!hearing of Tissaia's suicide in the books. She does remember her though, some moments before she dies in the final book. !<\n\nThen there's Istredd. I'm almost sure both>! he and Stregobor are going to get killed during the Thanedd Coup!<, if we get that far. Francesca is almost certainly going to have a much bigger role than just >!betraying the North and becoming queen!<. Now, Fringilla is the one I'm most unsure about. Like, where is her character even going? I'm pretty sure we'll never see >!her in Toussaint with Geralt!<. And I really >!can't see Philippa inviting her into the Lodge!<, if that storyline doesn't get changed. \n\nAny thoughts on this?"

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just finished watching Witcher on Netflix last night. It was super exciting and I can't wait for the next season. However, I struggle a lot with shows that are lore-heavy as I often miss important details. (I didn't realize there were three timelines until the third episode...) I jotted down notes while watching the show as I had a bunch of questions and confusions.\n\nThese are my summarized notes:\n\n**Geralt:** He is a witcher. Witchers are a never aging species that hunt monsters. His mom was a mage that abandoned him. He is bound by destiny to Cirilla of Cintra after the law of surprise at the banquet.\n\n**Law of Surprise:** How exactly does this work? Its a contract with fate to repay a favor but I do not understand the surprise aspect.\n\n**Cirilla:** Princess of Cintra. Heir to the throne. She can yell loud and stuff breaks. This is a family power according to the Queen. She also killed a bunch of rogue people from Cintra and a horse through some type of possession. There is something special with her which is why Nilfgaard (White Flame) is after her.\n\n**Dara:** Is there any significance to him?\n\n**Cintra:** A powerful kingdom lead by Queen Calanthe. It is attacked by Nilfgaard and defeated. Cintra also slaughtered majority of the elves, creating a large tension between humans and elves.\n\n**Yennifer:** A mage who is \"recruited\" to Aretuza by Tissaia. She is a quarter elf. She definitely has more magical capabilities than the other mages. After failing to save a baby, she quits the brotherhood and goes rogue? I am also confused by her teleporting to Istredd in the beginning.\n\n**Aretuza:** A school for female mages. The head teacher is Tissaia. Mages can not age but are given surgery to turn into adult versions of themselves once they are official mages? They give up the ability to have children in this process.\n\n**Ban Ard:** The male school for mages. Im assuming the head teacher is Stregobor. Is Artorius also a teacher here? And is this school on the same island as Aretuza?\n\n**Brotherhood/ Council :** A group of mages, almost like a police force? Each mage is assigned to a kingdom to make sure there isn't trouble. Mages can also be assigned to do research like Istredd. The ball where Yennifer attends (after receiving her surgery) is the graduation from the magical academies to celebrate each mage going off to their assignments. Mages, sorcerers, witches, wizards are all the same.\n\n**Vilgefortz:** A member of the Brotherhood. He lies to Yennifer in order to convince her to return to the Aretuza for the meeting of the mages. There is definitely something up with him because he seems incredibly strong but lost to Cahir (pretended to be dead) and then killed his friend.\n\n**Nilfgaard:** A kingdom from the South. Originally, they did not have a reputation for strength as Queen  Calanthe laughs them off when they attend her daughter's banquet. They eventually gain strength and go on a spree conquering the Northern Kingdoms. They are led by Cahir.\n\n**Cahir:** The general? of the Nilfgaardian army. Is he a member of their royal family? He is definitely one of the (if not the) mastermind behind their military strength. He wants to capture Cirilla to fulfill the needs of the White Flame.\n\n**Fringilla:** (Snake) Nephew of Artoius. She is assigned to Nilfgaard after the debacle with Yennifer. She starts her own mage school in Nilfgaard, training mages to fight in the Nilgaardian army. Her and Cahir are driven by something called the White Flame. I assume it is an organization?\n\nThis is all. Hope you guys enjoyed my rambling. If I am missing any key details or am wrong about anything, please let me know. Feel free to share any other comments or answers. I really enjoyed the show and just want to make sure I was following along correctly.\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you all for your kindness in helping clarify any questions I had! I just ordered the first four books of the series and am excited to delve deeper into the lore. If anyone else stumbles across this post and has anything else to add or correct, please feel free to do so. I really appreciate it!"

In my opinion, she comes off as extremely selfish and entitled.\n\nEvidence of her being entitled/selfish:\n\n* telling Tissaia \"life has no more to give\" when asked whether she wanted to die\n\n1. this insinuated Yen has had a bad life up until that point...which is true for her childhood but, after Aretuza and up until she left the royal Aedirn court, her life was - objectively speaking - better than 99% of the population.\n2. as a sorceress, she was afforded social status, wealth and power far beyond what any normal person could dream of in her society. This is especially the case considering she is a woman. Yen, who grew up on a pig's farm, must know this...so why was she not more grateful?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* her constant moaning about her fertility being taken away\n\n1. as many have pointed out, she was clearly told the physical transformation would take away her fertility. No one took anything away from her - it was a trade she herself voluntarily made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* her complaining her life is empty/not turning out the way she wanted\n\n1. again, the fault lies with her choices. She chose to be a royal advisor over a life with Istred which would have been more homely. so why is she complaining?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* her insisting on having her own kid\n\n1. if all Yen wanted to do was to give love, why couldn't she have started an orphanage or adopted a child right from the get go? Coming from Aretuza (a school full of broken and unwanted girls), she must know there are a lot of kids that would love a well-educated and well-resourced woman to take care of them. But instead (for a long time, at least before Ciri) the only kid that was deserving of her love must look like and come from her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* her not really taking her job seriously\n\n1. is it just me or is leaving your charge and an innocent baby to die just because the former insulted you incredibly unprofessional?\n2. that and she pretty much admitted she spent 30 years at Aedirn not really making any changes and just doing routine work. Unlike Fringilla, she didn't experiment with magic or push the boundaries of her role. This is a rightful shame given Yen - right from the first moment of meeting the Aedirnian king - had already proven she can change the king's mind if she wanted to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you agree with me? What are some other scenes you can think of?"

Anyways, I've always loved the Witcher (books, games, series), and have considered making a Major Arcana Tarot Deck (that's like a mini-Tarot deck, with only the primary 21 cards). IF I did that... Who would be what card?  Also - thoughts on using the visual representations from the games VS the show?\n\nHere are my thoughts so far, including the \"traditional\" card descriptions for the non-tarot-savvy:\n\nThe Fool \u2013 Geralt or Ciri? - Or Jaskier/Dandilion  (Not a stupid person, but one blindly adventuring into a journey)\n\nThe Magician \u2013 Vilgafortz or perhaps Francesca  (Represents a power balance of spirit, mind, and physical)\n\nThe High Priestess \u2013 Nenneke, Tissaia, or Philippa Eilhart(Intuition, wisdom)\n\nThe Empress \u2013 Yennefer  (Powerful feminine, mother figure)\n\nThe Emperor \u2013 Emhyr var Emreis  (Powerful male figure, authority)\n\nThe Hierophant -- Avallac'h  or possibly Vesesmir ? (A teacher or guide)\n\nThe Lovers \u2013 Geralt and Yen? or Crennegan and Lara (Union or duality)\n\nThe Chariot -- Roach (I had to) Or Zoltan's caravan, Kelpie, Irroquax (Direction, control)\n\nStrength \u2013 Queen Calanthe, or Ciri (Strength of character)\n\nThe Hermit \u2013 Vysogota (Contemplation)\n\nWheel of Fortune - Conjunction of the spheres!! (Chance, luck)\n\nJustice  - Regis or Zoltan(Clarity, truth)\n\nThe Hanged Man - Jaskier/Dandelion?(A person tied upside down, represents being 'stuck' in a situation)\n\nDeath -- The King of the Wild Hunt, Ciri, or Bonhart (An abrupt change, ending a cycle)\n\nTemperance \u2013 Iola, Shani, Nenneke, Rusty, Meletile (sp? the goddess)(Patience)\n\nThe Devil \u2013 Renfri, Falka (Temptation, materialism)\n\nThe Tower \u2013 Tor Lara and/or Zirael (A falling tower, represents sudden disaster or upheaval)\n\nThe Star  - Triss?, Yennefer (Hope, renewal)\n\nThe Moon - Fringilla, Regis (Mysterious, illusions)\n\nThe Sun - Nilfgard? Perhaps a group of them at an inn?(Success, celebration)\n\nJudgement \u2013 Scoia'tael, Toussaint?, Irroquax in the desert?

        "body": "A publication has unveiled a list called \u201c[The 100 Best Fantasy Books of All Time](https://time.com/collection/100-best-fantasy-books/).\u201d Predictably, it has been published to howls of complaints about the makeup of the list and what works are missing. Normally you could dismiss such a thing as hyperbole (what\u2019s wrong with \u201c100 Pretty Good Fantasy Books?\u201d) and the leanings of a single writer or blog, but in this case it is *Time Magazine* \u2013 still an influential publication, especially in the United States \u2013 and the list was assembled by a panel of famous and well-known writers, at least several of whom are noted for their deep knowledge of the genre, so the spotty and confusing nature of the list feels particularly notable.\n\nThe panel was made up of Tomi Adeyemi, Cassandra Clare, Diana Gabaldon, Neil Gaiman, Marlon James, N.K. Jemisin, George R.R. Martin and Sabaa Tahir. Slightly oddly, every member of the panel had at least one book on the panel and several had more than one. Fourteen books \u2013 14% of the \u201c100 Best Fantasy Books of All Time\u201d \u2013 were written by people on the panel that nominated it, which is an extraordinary figure. Reportedly panel members did not nominate their own books, but instead seem to have nominated one another instead.\n\nAccording to *Time*, the original nomination shortlist had 250 books on it and this was whittled down by *Time*\u2019s editors based on key factors: originality, ambition, artistry, critical and popular reception, and \u201cinfluence on the fantasy genre and literature more broadly.\u201d Which is fine, but it does seem to remove the point of the panel in the first place, if *Time*\u2019s editors chose to then edit the list by criteria that seem nebulous at best and self-contradictory at worst.\n\nThe resulting list certainly is not terrible, but it is strange and doesn\u2019t seem to fulfil the remit indicated by the title. It has a very heavy recency bias: two of the books were published this year (one in August, about eight weeks ago), a further twenty-four since 2015 and fifty-one in total since the turn of the century. This recency bias \u2013 which by its nature omits vast swathes of acknowledged classics of decades or centuries of standing in preference to the newest, shiniest flavour-of-the-month \u2013 makes one wonder why the panel didn\u2019t put together a list of \u201cThe 100 Greatest Works of Fantasy of the 21st Century (so far).\u201d The list would immediately become vastly more credible, and indeed, would be enhanced with the addition of forty-nine more books from this century.\n\nEven the recency bias feels somewhat inconsistent, with the absence of several high-profile recent fantasy novels which have enjoyed both immense critical and commercial success: *Senlin Ascends*\u00a0(2013) by Josiah Bancroft,\u00a0*The Goblin Emperor* (2014) by Katherine Addison, *Under the Pendulum Sun*\u00a0(2017) by Jeanette Ng,\u00a0*Gideon the Ninth* (2019) by Tamsyn Muir and anything by Kameron Hurley all feel like major omissions in any consideration of recent fantasy works.\n\nThe list also seems to lack any of kind of rules regarding what are even technically considered \u201cnovels.\u201d *The Lord of the Rings* \u2013 planned, written and executed as one single novel and only published in three for cost and paper rationing reasons - is listed as three books, but **The Once and Future King** \u2013 a series of four previously independent novels, sometimes now available in omnibus \u2013 is listed as one. If *The Lord of the Rings* was also counted as one book, then that would have freed up two more slots for other books. There are also multiple entries for trilogies and series which feel like they could have been condensed into one, allowing the scope of the list to be widened to address the more egregious absences. The list also mostly avoids short story collections before randomly dropping a couple into the mix, which makes it feel like the criteria for the list was not strongly defined beforehand.\n\nThe list also has a baffling attitude to pre-modern works of the fantastic. Including *The Arabian Nights* and *Le Morte D\u2019Arthur* makes one wonder why *The Odyssey* and *The Iliad* are missing, not to mention *The Aeneid*, *The Ramayana* and the *Mahabharata*. *Beowulf* feels like it should merit a mention, and perhaps the Finnish myth-cycle, *The Kalevala*. *Gulliver\u2019s Travels*, a vital work of early fantasy, is notable by its absence, as are absolutely any works connected to Shakespeare. This part of the list feels very much like a sop to the fact that fantasy is an ancient genre and that a couple of pre-modern works should be slapped in to make it vaguely more credible before moving on to more recent material.\n\nEven worse is the list completely side-stepping the foundational texts of much of modern fantasy: *The Rose and the Ring*, *Phantastes*, *The Well of the World\u2019s End*, *The King of Elfland\u2019s Daughter*, *The Worm Ouroboros* and *Lud-in-the-Mist* being completely ignored is remarkable. Two or three of them being skipped over might be expected, but all of them? The incoherence on whether short story collections count or not may also explain the absence of Robert E. Howard\u2019s **Conan** and C.L. Moore\u2019s **Jiriel** stories.\n\nProbably the single biggest absence on the list is that of *The Hobbit* by J.R.R. Tolkien, published in 1937. The absence of *The Hobbit* is baffling, and if *The Lord of the Rings* had been included as one book (as it should have been), then *The Hobbit* could have also been included and another place freed up for another writer. As it stands, the list is YA and children\u2019s book heavy but the biggest and most influential children\u2019s fantasy novel of all time is missing. The absence of *The Silmarillion*\u00a0is less surprising, given it's (oft-overstated) reputation as a \"difficult\" work, but its absence in favour of decidedly more disposable, recent fare is interesting.\n\nA major issue with any list of fantasy works is the propensity of the genre towards long series, often ones which cumulatively have a huge impact but singling out single novels is difficult or contentious. For this reason, most such lists will allow nominations for an entire series rather than individual titles, but this list does not permit that (well, apart from the **Once and Future King**\u00a0quartet, for unspecified reasons). This leaves the list in an awkward position where several times it appears to imply a place for the entire series using the first novel as an example (*The Eye of the World* representing the entire 15-book **Wheel of Time**, despite the book being middling in the quality level of the series as a whole), but in others it randomly picks a book from somewhere else in the series (*The Wee Free Men*, a rather minor and very definitely nowhere near the best entry from the **Discworld** series), or picks out the by-consensus best book of the series (*A Storm of Swords* representing **A Song of Ice and Fire** rather than the first book, *A Game of Thrones*). Towards the end, the list seems to lose consistency altogether by picking out multiple books from very recent series which have not yet had a chance to withstand the test of time. With the exception of the two entries for N.K. Jemisin\u2019s **Broken Earth** trilogy (since all three won Hugo Awards and immense critical acclaim, there is some rationale for that), most of these feel bit over the top: R.F Kuang, Tomi Adeyemi, Ken Liu and Sabaa Tahir are all reasonable recent writers, but giving them two entries apiece feels like overkill when, say, established and important authors like Robin Hobb, Andrzej Sapkowski, Kate Elliott and Steven Erikson are missing from the list altogether.\n\nFantasy is of course a broad church, far broader than say \u201cscience fiction\u201d or \u201cdetective novel,\u201d with very elastic boundaries. The list goes for the broadest possible definition, meaning that epic fantasy, magic realism, children\u2019s fantasy, modern YA, science fantasy, fairy stories and myths are conflated together. Even so, the list feels somewhat unrepresentative of the genre. The New Weird goes completely unmentioned (China Mi\u00e9ville or Steph Swainston are both notable by their absences), as does steampunk and, startlingly, urban fantasy: Kate Griffin\u2019s **Matthew Swift** series feels like it should have appeared from a literary perspective, or Jim Butcher or Charlaine Harris if you wanted to go for something wither more commercial clout.\n\nThe list also leans very heavily towards children's fantasy and YA. Again, if the list was specifically meant to reward books in that mode, that would be fine but it does say it is for the best fantasy books of all time, not the best YA fantasy novels of all time. YA and children's fiction is overrepresented to such an extreme that it's possible that someone looking at this list would conclude that fantasy is a juvenile genre unworthy of serious literary consideration; the absence of fantasy and magic realism's literary heavyweights like Gene Wolfe, Mervyn Peake, Jorge Borges and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, and Rushdie only getting on the list with a children's book, may reinforce this view. This is not to say that YA and children's fantasy should *not* be represented on the list - there are numerous classic works of fantasy that are YA or children's books in origin (and I previously noted the puzzling absence of *The Hobbit*) but the field on this list is overrepresented when other incredibly popular subgenres are wholly missing.\n\nThe\u00a0list is clearly aiming for inclusion and fairer representation of non-white and non-male authors, which is great, but does brush against the elephant in the room. Much moreso even than science fiction, fantasy was very white and very male until comparatively recently: pre-1960 female fantasy authors are very thin on the ground, clearly a regrettable situation, but one that is a historical fact. The list seems to address this by simply minimising the importance all of early fantasy altogether, including those female authors who were influential and important (the aforementioned C.L. Moore, Hope Mirrlees of *Lud-in-the-Mist* fame, science fantasy author Leigh Brackett, Ruth Thompson and Rachel Cosgrove of the later **Oz** books and more), or throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nThe list\u2019s criteria for inclusion also do not extend to works not originally published in English. Only three of the books were not originally published in English and the list leaves out other influential and important non-English works. The Dutch *De brief vor de koning* (*The Letter for the King*) by Tonke Dragt is missing and the Polish **Wied\u017amin** (*Witcher*) series by Andrzej Sapkowski doesn\u2019t even rate a mention, despite both being recently brought to a wider English-speaking language by Netflix adaptations. *Die unendliche Geschichte*\u00a0(*The Neverending Story*) by Michael Ende is also MIA.\n\nThe list also has a hesitant attitude towards controversy. The glaring absence of H.P. Lovecraft is likely down to his racist viewpoints despite the immense influence of his work over the modern genre, and I suspect Robert E. Howard\u2019s absence might also be down to the perceived racism in his works (although Howard\u2019s attitudes towards race were vastly more progressive than Lovecraft\u2019s, or indeed most people of his time, and improved remarkably over his short lifetime) as well. The entry for *The Eye of the World* makes the interesting choice of accusing the author of sexism (the entry has a whole seems apologetic for including the book, making one wonder why they did) and even *A Storm of Swords* gets a non sequitur side-line where George R.R. Martin\u2019s recent clumsy handling of the 2020 Hugo Awards is noted. However, the mention of controversy is seemingly limited to older authors: Cassandra Clare\u2019s multiple brushes with plagiarism accusations and lawsuits are cheerfully ignored and Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s online meltdown over an author with a similar book title to her own goes resolutely unmentioned.\n\nWhen it comes to individual works that should have been mentioned but are not, there are too many to mention and of course the fact that 100 positions is far too few to accommodate any kind of broad overview of the genre. However, the absence of both Mervyn Peake\u2019s **Gormenghast** trilogy and Gene Wolfe\u2019s **Book of the New Sun**, often cited and indeed voted the greatest SFF work of all time, is ridiculous, and the absence of any of Robin Hobb\u2019s work which distils the sometimes-high ideals of fantasy down to the level of human experience is glaring. *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell*'s baffling absence may make some consider if the list has, in fact, gone out of its way to be contrarian.\n\nUltimately the list can be seen as a form of clickbait to engender greater discussion of the genre, but it feels like *Time* deliberately misrepresented the list by calling it the \u201c100 Best Fantasy Books of All Time.\u201d They should have divided the list in three, publishing perhaps a pre-20th Century list, a 20th Century list and a 21st Century instalment, which is really the only way of doing such an enormous concept justice. As it stands, the list is too incoherent to be of much worth. If this was a Buzzfeed list aimed at new readers, it\u2019d be one thing, but I generally expect better of *Time*."

        "body": "Hello. My friend asked me today if I've ever encountered \"Mother-Son\" trope or archetype in fantasy. He explained that he knows some examples of \"Father-Daughter\" mentor archetype like in the Witcher (Geralt and Ciri), or The Last Of Us (Joel and Ellie), but he never encountered the opposite kind of relationship. Neither do I.\n\nSo that's my question - Do you know examples (no matter who the main character is) of stories with mother-figure and her raised/adopted son , who is also kind of a mentor and teacher to him?\n\nWe're both really curious about your answers."

I loved Leviathans Wakes, a fun noir sci-fi book.  I knew it wouldnt continue that way and I was okay with that.  The second book was a slog at first. 3 new characters, 2 I was lukewarm on at first, and the third, Prax was boring. \n\nI kept with it and once I hit the 50% mark I couldnt put it down.  Bobbie and Avasarala really grew on me and I ended up loving them by the end.  I took a book off and then tried to start the 3rd, expecting more Bobbie and Avasarala, figured they'd gives us Earth and Mars POVs or something, but nope.  An entire new cast of characters other than Holden and this is how the entire series does it other than some POVs coming back for a few chapters.  \n\nThe plot is okay, it seems to be slow moving in terms of over arching, almost feels like a broadcast TV show, one book is like an episode in a huge series and only the last five minutes pushes the plot forward.\n\nI might check out the show, I might even come back, but the immense disappointment of realizing that I have a new cast of POVs pretty much the whole way is too great to over come.\n\n**The Witcher** I read them in chronological, so started with the short stories which are awesome,  and then I hit the novels and they seem to alternate between enjoyable and okay.  I hit Tower of Swallow, I somehow finished it, but it was mostly out of stubbornness.  I found it really confusing and chapters jumping around in time, different POVs, and the Ciri stuff doesnt interest me.  The novels feels like they need another editor.  They just feel kind of choppy, maybe its the translation.\n\n**Book of the Ancestor**  I really liked Red Sister, but Grey Sister was a let down for me.   It starts slow, as did the first,but it started slow in similar ways and about 1/3rd of the way in it starts to get slightly more interesting, but not page turner interesting for awhile after that\n\nGrey Sister doesnt exactly pick up right after the first, it does, but it takes awhile before continues to progress the plot. I liked some of the places the story goes, but some places not so much, I don't really like where he's going with things like the shiphearts. Also this book feels a tad disjointed.\n\nI will probably read Holy Sister at some point, but I'm not dying to read it like I was this book after Red Sister and I find it overall a mixed bag"

The different settings could be different planets, different dimensions, different time periods within a single world, or just different places that feel very different for whatever reason. I've realized that this is a trope that I like, although I can't think of very many examples. Here are a few examples (or closely related things) that come to mind:\n\n* **Chrono Trigger** (video game): features multiple settings, past, present and future, with very different cultures and levels of technology.\n* **The Witcher 3** (another video game): Spoilers: >!I don't quite remember the details, but one character, Ciri has been travelling between different universes, some apparently futuristic or similar to our own in technology. You visit some of these different worlds at one point.!<\n\nSome things that are close, but not exactly what I've got in mind:\n\n* **Portal fantasy** (e.g., Narnia, Kay's Fionavar Tapestry): this is maybe the most common version of this trope. But I'm mostly thinking of stories that aren't just about discovering a portal between the real world and a fantasy world (unless, e.g., there are multiple portals, to multiple weird fantasy worlds or something).\n* **Sanderson's cosmere books**: These involve worlds that are connected and characters that travel between them... but the stories aren't about traveling between the worlds.\n* **Tel'aran'rhiod in Wheel of Time, or Shadesmar in Stormlight Archive**: again, close but not quite. I'm trying to think of stories where the settings are (roughly) equally real and fleshed out. So the world of dreams (or similar things) aren't quite what I'm after.\n\nI'm curious whether this is something that resonates with others, and whether there are a bunch of examples out there that I'm missing.

        "body": "Let me just introduce the context of my reading: I first read **The Last Wish**, but did not like the format; after seeking advice here on r/Fantasy, I decided to plunge straight into the first novel. Maybe it played its part in my appreciation of the book, you'll tell me. I might be mixing those two volumes in my review, because they are part of the same universe, and therefore share some features like worldbuilding, for example. I believe I have nothing spoilery so no tagging, but feel free to correct me!\n\nBlurb:\n\n>For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf.  \nGeralt of Rivia, the cunning assassin known as The Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child. This child has the power to change the world - for good, or for evil.\n\nI guess the **TL;DR** here is that I did not like this book. It's a **2/5** for me: I'm not actively regretting spending time reading it, but I forced myself to finish it and did not enjoy it. So here is why:\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* This was the biggest disapointment to me. They felt shallow: Geralt is over powered, and I think that feature in itself does not leave much room for a nuanced character; he is always the most in every situation, and particularly so regarding seduction, because every female character has sex with him (and even though all of them are consensual, which is great, a grown man bedding 17-16 year-old girls ends up being downright weird if not uncomfortable).\n* I know it is called \"The Witcher\" for a reason, and ultimately it is going to revolve around him as a main character... but I can't help but feel it is a tad too much here. The author has a tendency to describe Geralt through the eyes of every single character he meets, to give us that first shiver again and again. In short, the fact that every single character revolves around Geralt (for jealousy, for love, for fear or for hate) annoys me. It feels they are all there just to make him look better/smarter/more hansome, etc, and they end up being fairly interchangeable.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nEven though it is the #3 in the saga, I think this is really a first book: that is where it is really set up. You are introduced to some history of the world, the different races of sentient beings, their interests in the war that is going to follow... So in a way, not a lot happens in this volume, but that was really not what bothered me. We follow Ciri's progression and her training, which is generally a well-appreciated moment.\n\n**Worldbuilding:**\n\n* Like the characters, the world seemed to be all surface and no depth, but maybe I carried this impression from the 1st volume, where it was really evident. The world is supposed to be very extensive and complex, but most of it is just names, and makes it mere background. Not that every book needs to be heavily political and complex, mind you, but if it's going to be background, treat it as such and don't pretend the reader needs to remember names and places and collect data for future relevance. Maybe what reinforced this impression is the fact that Geralt has a reputation everywhere, which is not logical if the world is supposed to be that huge.\n* The magic is not explained, and gave me the impression of popping up when convenient. There are no(t many) limits to its uses, and this lack of boundaries did not help me form an interest.\n\n**Pacing:**\n\nI liked it a lot better than The Last Wish, where it was just a string of adventures. I appreciated the slice-of-life moments where Ciri trains, and overall it builds up nicely to more and more tension.\n\n**Prose:**\n\n* I had the book in French, but also listened to some parts of the English audiobook, and neither of those is the original language; I wonder how much is lost in translation, and we have to bear this in mind.\n* The descriptions are nice, they really produce an atmosphere, and it helps anchor the plot in a place and a time. The characters and the landscapes are easy to visualize, and all that in a concise way that rarely gets too much and boring.\n* However, the amount of dialogue vs. description/action is such that the audiobook ended up giving me headaches. Especially in the debate scenes, they dragged on and on, and I couldn't see the point of that.\n\nSo, short of ripping me apart, tell me what you think: where do you agree and disagree? Did you love it, hate it, mehed it? Have I missed something that would have made me enjoy it?\n\n**To conclude, I would say it is recommended if you like:** mentor-mentee relationships, progression fantasy, chosen one trope, over-powered character, epic fantasy.\n\n**Bingo 2020:** translated, epigraphs, politics."

        "body": "Welcome to the end of the first 80% of the list. It's all downhill from here (both in terms of number of books to read and in the quality of my reviews)! Each month I will be reading 5 books from our [Top Novels of 2018 list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/907ty2/the_rfantasy_2018_top_novels_poll_results/) until I have read the starting book from each series. [When we last checked in](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/hrneka/climbing_mount_readmore_reading_our_top_fantasy/), I nearly finished 34-30. Now we go from 30 to 26:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**30. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke (24 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Magic is returning to England. With the stuffy Mr. Norrell preaching the virtues of academic magic and the boisterous, improvisational Jonathan Strange taking an opposite approach, London has never felt more lively as the two bicker over the proper ways to reintroduce magic to the country. But there is a mysterious foe, a fairy known as the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair who lurks menacingly behind the scenes and works to undo all that these two magicians hope to achieve.\n\nThe great thing about this book is, first and foremost, the extremely well realized characters. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are just fully fleshed out, memorable characters from the instant the appear in the book that they practically leap off the page. Even less three dimensional characters such as the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair are appropriately menacing and memorable in their roles. But the thing that makes the characters pop off of each other is how they conflict with each other in their various understandings of magic. See, JS&MN is a book about magic and is thematically very interested in exploring the differing approaches of its two leads: the systematic and practically scientific approach of Norrell versus the freewheeling and innovative anything goes approach of Strange. Yes, that's right, this book as about hard magic versus soft magic. What's remarkable is that, without ever picking a side, Clarke manages to portray both systems at their best and shows what they can do when they work in tandem while acknowledging a bit of natural animosity between the two schools of thought. Maybe this makes the book a bit too insular for readers from outside the fantasy genre but for anyone who has ever gotten stuck in a \"hard magic or soft magic?\" debate, it is wonderful to read a story that shows them as respectable equals that have their own strengths and weaknesses. And lastly, there is some marvelous humor in here if you happen to know your early 19th century British history. Clarke peppers in a lot of subtle jabs at trends and opinions of the times that are extremely gratifying to see if you know where to look. I'm not totally sure the historical setting is needed outright but those jokes go a long way to justifying them even if this story could be set at almost any time period in Britain as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThere is one very serious flaw here and that is that the first quarter of the book is tediously boring. But wait, how can I call this a great book and one of my favorites if I think close to 250 pages of it are a chore to read? A great question. I think the book largely makes up for the lengthy stumbling intro but I can't really blame anyone who couldn't power through the nearly novel length chunk of time where little happens. Some defend this beginning part by saying it makes sense that the section largely from stodgy Mr. Norrell's POV is dull but while it makes sense, I think it's a profoundly bad idea for any author to consciously make such a large sequence dull because it matches the character. It's okay to write about dull things in fun and interesting ways, it's preferred even! The best kind of writing is the kind that takes the dull and makes it interesting, not the kind that takes the dull and double checks to make sure it stays dull out of a misguided sense of tonal cohesion. Isn't half the fun of the movie Office Space that they managed to make a hilarious comedy out of the drudgery of meaningless office work? No one would want to watch Office Space if it decided to be as boring as actually working in an office was. And I wish Clarke had livened up this beginning because it does turn off many people who I believe would love the book if they could make it farther in.\n\nAll this is to say that I think JS&MN is a masterpiece. Highly flawed in some ways but still exceptional in enough other ways to make it a justified classic in my view. If you can soldier through the weak opening, you'll find a novel that opens up in countless interesting ways that's full of magic and charm that's hard to resist.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** A cat-squasher of a book with humor, memorable characters, and a lot to say about magic.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** Yes, this really feels like a world ripe for more exploration.\n\n**28.** **~~The Last Wish~~** **Blood of Elves by Andrzej Sapkowski, Book 3 of The Witcher (37 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Geralt of Rivia is sworn to protect Ciri, granddaughter of the King of Cintra, and a child of great power who is being targeted for assassination by an unknown foe.\n\n**ETA:** I initially had the wrong title written down here. A user correctly pointed out that I sounded like I had actually read Blood of Elves, not The Last Wish and sure enough, that's what I had read. Whoops.\n\nA common refrain among reviewers who come away from a book disappointed is \"I wanted to like this.\" It's kind of a silly thing to say because yeah, of course you did. Normal people don't actively wish to have a bad reading experience. The closest you get to that feelings is resignation because you don't expect to like something but even then that's more trepidation than hope. Which brings me to my feelings on the Witcher. I don't get the Witcher. Don't really care for the games, don't care for the tv show, and every description I've heard of the books makes them sound bland. A super powerful guy goes around killing monsters, sleeping with a ton of women, and has magical powers that require him to be completely emotionless? It sounds like all the least interesting aspects of power fantasy rolled into one and having an emotionless protagonist is almost always boring barring rare exceptions like when such a character is acted by Leonard Nimoy. So, in approaching this book, I was pretty worried I would not like this at all.\n\nLuckily, it turned out better than I expected. The novel has a really incredible sense for naturalistic pacing where everything seems to happen at the right time without feeling force or too quick or too slow. The prose is also lean and something else while still making room for some striking imagery where it can. The world, while a bit derivative with all the classic fantasy creatures, also feels somewhat fresh and filled with possibilities. Sapkowski manages to inject just enough novelty in his world to make it feel newer and more original than I think it would sound on paper. I also think there's a lot of interesting political and religious worldbuilding even if those elements are often relegated to the background. I would sometimes find myself pausing to mull over some of these little tidbits of information like the fascinating reveal in one chapter that wizards are mostly infertile and those that aren't are often forced to infertility by other jealous wizards. It's an interesting detail that implies a ton of character to the world and showcases an all too believable pettiness in these powerful masters that I found captivating.\n\nHowever, Geralt is exactly as boring as I was worried about and his boring nature is made all the worse by the fact that I'm not sure there's a single character in here who doesn't talk about how great Geralt is. Ciri's firs remark about Geralt is that he can make her believe things when no one else can, the bard Dandilion's first scene is of him singing Geralt's praises quite literally, Triss Merigold's first scene has her fantasizing about getting to sleep with Geralt. It just goes on and on, meanwhile Geralt's only actions for the first hundred and some pages of the book is to tell Ciri that bad dreams aren't worth worrying about. This is pretty disappointing example of how showing over telling can hamper a good premise. It would be far more compelling to see Geralt performing heroics and let us readers decide how awesome he is rather than have and endless string of side characters talk him up at length while he twiddles his thumbs. This also kind of leads into the problem that the plot feels unfocused. I can't tell how much of this is due to the non-linear storytelling of the novel (which I admire the ambition of but I am unclear on what it added to the actual plot. It kind of seemed like a gimmick rather than a necessary element) but very few of the threads in the story appeared to link back up and little changed from what I think the beginning of the story was to what the end of the story was. The book began with Ciri potentially having great powers and getting training for them while being the target of a nebulous plot to harm her and the book ended with all of that remaining the same and no information as to why Ciri was targeted being revealed. No relationships really changed during the book either except for Ciri's relationship to Yenneffer but their whole relationship began and concluded in the last chapter of the book, so I can't really call that a satisfying development.\n\nIt's certainly not a bad book and there are good elements here. Even the things I wasn't quite on board with (like the non-linear story) were at least motivated by a desire to tell an unconventional story which makes me want to cut this book more slack when compared to other books on this list that have failed for laziness but I can't say I have any desire to continue on with a main character this boring and a writing style this focused on telling over showing. I think this could be laying the groundwork for a more interesting story given how marvelous the worldbuilding seemed to be but I am also deeply disinterested in the main character so I'm not sure an interesting world is enough to compel me to read the next entry. I can see why it appeals to some but it ultimately just wasn't for me.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** It's an ambitious work that hints at a spectacular world to unfold in later stories. The real reason it's on the list though is because the video games are popular.\n* **Would you continue on?** Probably not.\n\n**28. The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison (same position on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Maia has lived his whole life as an estranged outcast until his father's death when he is ushered to the capital and crowned as the next emperor. Through an unfamiliar political terrain, assassination attempts, and his own scarred past, Maia must find a way to become a better ruler than even he believes he is capable of being.\n\nAs this is a slice of life novel, there is less focus on a conventional plot and more focus on the development of the main character as Maia works through his emotional struggles with ruling and tries to acclimate to the capital. I've seen a number of people get frustrated with this softer plot focus but I personally feel it works well for the type of story being told. Maia is a cinnamon roll of a character who just wants to do well and for everyone to get along and who is so unprepared for what he is getting into but still manages to win over a few crucial allies through his unassuming nature and pure lack of guile. Thematically, the story is most interested in the importance of emotional connection which in some ways makes it a bit of an anti-conflict book as the resolutions to most situations in the book come not from battles or fights but from small acts of kindness or generosity. In fact, the biggest emotional touchstone of the novel is arguably Maia forgiving someone who had hurt him when he was younger where most other fantasy books would have their emotional climax at a battle or with two characters falling in love. The lower key approach and emphasis on community and empathy makes the book spectacular comfort reading.\n\nThe obvious weakness here is that the slice of life approach can leave the book feeling meandering and plotless to people who prioritize action over character. I personally think Addison manages to sprinkle in more than enough action to keep even those of us with weaker tolerances for slice of life reading interested but I'm sure that's not a universal truth. I've also heard the complaint that the names in this book are hard to remember and the counterargument that the names are purposefully hard to simulate the experience Maia is going through of being in over his head in a foreign land. Personally, neither argument really resonates with me as someone who has always been terrible with names. These names didn't seem noticeably harder than usual fantasy names to me and I of course completely forgot all of them anyway. All I can say is that while I was reading it was pretty easy for me to go \"oh yeah, that guy!\" so I'm not sure it really added the layer of challenge that others have said it does but it's a common complaint so I figured it was worth listing here. There's probably also an argument to be made that it's politically naive to have a story where all it takes to solve deeply entrenched political problems is kindness and empathy but honestly, I think the genre could use a little more of this kind of wish fulfillment and a little less traditional power fantasy so I can't hold this bit against the book.\n\nThis is one that I personally think is great but it is so different from the types of books that usually get popular on this sub that I'm not totally sure how a new reader would feel coming to it. It's absolutely worth reading but I think it's important to be prepared for it to be a very different kind of reading experience than epic fantasy fans are used to.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** An uplifting book about the power of dedicating yourself to your task and building camaraderie.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** Yes and I think this story lends itself well towards easy sequelizing. You don't even have to stick with the current ruler, just random stories about managing the bureaucracy of this unique world would be enough.\n\n**26. Lions of al-Rassan by Guy Gavriel Kay (42 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>On a peninsula divided in a religious war between Jaddites and Asharites, the future of the land will be shaped by three people. Rodrigo Belmonte, ferocious commander of Jaddite forces, Ammar ibn Khairan, poet and regicide, and Jehane, doctor and member of the Kindath minority that is persecuted by both sides. The unlikely friendship between these three will shape events to come as the inevitably must choose sides in the fight between al-Rassan and Esperana.\n\nThis is probably GGK's best book. I have to admit I'm far less certain after having read Sailing to Sarantium though I can't be certain until I get a free moment to check out Lord of Emperors, but this is the standalone that works best. Thematically, the novel explores the time period known in our world as the Reconquista, when Spain fought against Muslim conquerers to reclaim the Iberian peninsula over a period of hundreds of years. GGK condenses this period down to about 20 years and only portrays two of those 20 in this book for the sake of keeping the work standalone. His primary concern is exploring the cyclical religious violence as each side uses the other side's previous atrocities as justification for committing further atrocities and in sympathizing with the Kindath (an analogue of Jewish people) that are caught in between and despised by both sides. In spite of those enmities. most of the book is spent developing the friendships of representatives from each of the major religions of the region and each of them is fairly well developed. Jehane and ibn Khairan are probably the most complex characters as Belmonte is a little too morally pure for the type of story being told (though from what I gather this does seem to be fairly close to how the person his character was based on behaved) but he is still a likable character and it is nice to see a character who treats all of the people of the region well. Naturally, when you've got three religious groups that can't get along, the story isn't going to have a perfectly happy conclusion though GGK does manage an interesting threading of the needle where the ending feels far more optimistic and happier than it could have wound up.\n\nThere aren't a lot of complaints I have here. The biggest is just that I think ibn Khairan and Belmonte's relationship isn't as well developed as it needs to be for this story to truly shine. They share remarkably little screen time and rarely converse with each other though characters repeatedly state that they clearly respect each other greatly. Jehand, as the woman caught between them, is often used a proxy for their relationship with her intense feelings for both of them being used as something of a substitute for showing a deeper relationship between the two male leads. We care that these men might wind up as enemies who will have to kill each other because Jehane cares about them and doesn't want to lose either of them but neither of them has spent enough time with the other in the book for an organic feeling, convincing relationship to form. And yes, this does technically count as something of a love triangle so I assume there are readers who will be turned off from the novel solely for that reason.\n\nSo if you're a fan of historical fantasy, tragedy, and think you might like the works of GGK, this is probably the best place to start with his books.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** It's a wonderfully tragic tale about conflicting loyalties and religious extremism.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** I'm not sure where the characters could go from here but yes.\n\n**26. The Black Company by Glen Cook, Book 1 of the Chronicles of the Black Company (30 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>The Lady has risen from her tomb and seeks to conquer the world. To that end, she has hired the mercenary group known as the Black Company to serve her needs. As the company handles the darkest work and helps the Lady as she crushes the rebellion that seeks to stop her, the company's historian, Croaker, grows ever more enamored with service to this dark ruler even as he fears for his and his friends' lives under her rule. Can the Black Company survive service to one of the greatest evils that ever walked the earth?\n\nThere are so few things like the Black Company in epic fantasy, even among the books that drew inspiration from Black Company, that it's easy to get hyperbolic with praise quickly. From it's effortless sense of scope and scale, to the morally gray but still easy to like characters, and the unique worldbuilding that somehow does in 200 pages what most fantasy authors think they're doing in 600, it's just an impressive work all around. Croaker and his strange relationship to the dictatorial Lady is fascinating to follow along with as he struggles between his interest in her and his disgust with both her actions and himself for being in her employ. The use of magic in this world is also something I appreciate in that it seems to ever only come in flavors of great and terrible from the way the Lady can literally steal her enemy's souls and convert them to her cause to the way the Taken that she creates can use the magic carpet they have on hand to produce seriously devastating aerial bombardments. Cook is also very skilled at tone, being able to move fairly effortlessly between the kind of gallows humor that soldiers are sometimes known for, the creepiness and horror of the scenes with the Taken, and the more lighthearted moments when the Company gets time off to themselves and try to forget the part they're playing in destroying the freedom fighters who oppose the Lady.\n\nThe downsides of Black Company are effectively inverses of what makes it so good. 200 pages is too short for some people to get sucked in, it leaves very little room for meaningful character development so if you don't like the characters at the beginning all the much, they won't be changing too significantly. I've also heard the opinion that epic fantasy doesn't truly feel epic if it doesn't take up enough page and while I don't think Black Company quite falls into this failing, I can definitely see how a trilogy that's shorter in total than many single entries of other epic fantasy works might not feel suitably epic.\n\nThis review turned out a lot shorter than I expected but I guess it fits for the subject matter. Black Company is well worth a read and with such a short length, even if you don't like the story you at least won't have much of your time wasted.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** A truly unique epic fantasy with plenty of action and adventure.\n* **Would you continue on?** In a heartbeat.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd that's it for this month! Be sure to check back same time next month. As always, feel free to comment with your thoughts on any of these books and their respective series. Contrary opinions are especially welcome as I'd like to know what people saw in these series that I didn't."

        "body": "Sorry if someone has made a post like this before, it can be worded in different ways so I couldn\u2019t really find any.\n\nI\u2019m a sucker for exclusivity in the use of magic, where few in the population are born with the ability to use it, and the normal population can\u2019t - and of course, when at least one of the main characters has that ability. It probably comes from a childhood dream of being special by having superpowers, using those to wow others. So now, as an adult, I kind of live that dream through the characters I read about. \n\nAs you can imagine I devoured Mistborn, not only does it have this trope but the magic system itself was so unique and I love the aspect of different metals giving different powers. Same reason I loved Harry Potter, with different spells producing different effects, and wizards being born with their powers.\n\nThe Witcher is another example, while anyone could technically learn magic (as far as I remember) some people were born as a Source with a deeper connection to it. And then there was Ciri being even more special than that. The Marvel movies are also something I ended up being a big fan of, especially due to this aspect.\n\nWhile other people seem to dislike it, I also love when a \u201cnormal\u201d character we\u2019ve been following for a long time becomes a magic user [All Mistborn] >!through a very rare event, a prime example being Elend becoming Mistborn by ingesting Lerasium, and partly Wax/Marasi using the Bands although that was a one time thing!< . Someone experiencing magic for the first time is just so thrilling, even more so when you are used to them living without it. I also just like the juxtaposition of a magic user and a normal person, the way they interact and fight in different ways, and the normal one being in wonder of the magic (mostly happens if the magic is kept secret from others, the Fantastic Beasts movie comes to mind with Jacob as a muggle). \n\nI am currently reading Stormlight, only 25% through Way of Kings, and while I am really enjoying it I feel the magic system is missing something - while it certainly hasn\u2019t been explained yet in its entirety, and I am sure I practically know nothing, the stuff I do know so far seems to be usable by anyone (Shardblades/plate, soulcasting) and it takes a bit of the magic away from me, ironically. Szeth in the prologue did something completely different though which I am still curious about. I\u2019m sure there is much more to this series than what it seems so far. But right now the known magic is kind of uninteresting. Hopefully that just means there is a secret magic system the main population don\u2019t know about.\n\nPeople don\u2019t HAVE to be born with it only; it could be something the main character learns or achieves during their life, although then there needs to be some other reason why the majority know nothing about it.\n\nAnyways, do you have some great suggestions?"

The complex situations that characters get into and what they ultimately take away from them is meant just as much for the reader as it is for the fictional character, and I think there's a lot you can gain from your favorite characters.\n\nHere are mine in no particular order:\n\n1. **Fitzchivalry Farseer** (*The Farseer Trilogy* by Robin Hobb): I feel like I've been inside Fitz's head, I've related to him, I've been through the wringer with him, He\u2019s got some issues, he lacks self worth, and has feelings of failure, and sure, I might get frustrated with how blind he can sometimes be to others motivations. But it\u2019s weaknesses like this that makes his character feel so real. He will always be one of my all time favorites. Also the Fool and Nighteyes, as what would Fitz be without them?\n2. **Vin** (*Mistborn Trilogy* by Brandon Sanderson): The Mistborn books by Brando Sando are a lot of fun! They have one of the best magic systems I've read and they also have some fantastic characters, vin being one of my favorites. Like Fitz, Vin also starts out as the ultimate underdog and I\u2019m a sucker for underdog stories. When we first meet Vin as an orphan surviving on the ash covered streets of Luthadel, where she\u2019s very untrusting and tries to make herself as unsuspecting and  invisible as possible. Over the course of the books she has some great character growth and is given some incredible action scenes, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s Vin's internal struggles and how much growth she goes through over the course of the books that are a huge part of why I love her character! It takes her some time to grow, which I think was done so well and is very realistic.\n3. **Dalinar Kholin** (*The Stormlight Archive series* by Brandon Sanderson): Dalinar is has one of Sanderson\u2019s very best character arcs in my opinion. He was a terrible person, he committed warcrimes, he's a former warlord turned peacemaker, but nobody trusts him now because of all the murdering he did when he was The Blackthorn. Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing. Not only is he a brilliant character, but he is inspiring to the reader.\n4. **Kvothe** (*The Kingkiller Chronicle* by Patrick Rothfuss): Kvothe goes through immense personal tragedy, and turns to music and learning to cope with this. He's definitely a polarizing character. While he's a genius in some regards, he's also a complete idiot sometimes. He makes immensely reckless decisions that endanger everyone around him, and he often messes things up and is the cause of all of his problems. He can be arrogant and lets his pride and anger get the better of him. The stories told about Kvothe are hugely overblown and sometimes far from the truth. In fact he often stretches the truth to inflate his legendary status. His flaws are undeniable, which is why I don't agree when some people refer to him as a Mary Sue/Gary Stu character. It took me a good re-read or two to really notice the extent of Kvothe\u2019s flaws, but it's these flaws, and the mystery behind his situation in the present day, that make him such an interesting character.\n5. **Glokta** (*The First Law* books by Joe Abercrombie): Glokta was a character I wasn't expecting to like so much. He's not a character you like because he's nice, you like him because he's interesting and just oozes character. Glokta was once a talented swordsman before being captured and brutaslly tortured for 3 years. He's now a crippled bitter shell of the man he used to be, and a tortuerer himself working as one of the king's inquisitors. Glokta lives a miserable life where even the simple act of climbing stairs or getting out of bed is a painful and frustrating ordeal. He has some hilarious inner monologues, and is just such a unique character.\n6. **Rand Al'Thor** (*Wheel of Time* by Robert Jordan): I'm new to WoT and only on book 5. There's not a lot I can say about Rand without spoiling things, but while there's a lot of characters I've been enjoying in the series, Rand is still the one I care about the most and who I find the most compelling. All the stuff he goes through is enough to make anyone crazy, though he has more of an excuse than most people.\n7. **Moiraine Damodred** (*Wheel of Time* by Robert Jordan): Again only 5 books in, but Moiraine is amazing. I agree with Daniel Greene when he says she feels like an evolution of Gandalf, she fits into that old wise wizard trope but brings it to the next level. There\u2019s a lot to respect about her, she\u2019s a very mysterious and powerful character, she\u2019s able to keep her head in whatever situation is thrown at her. While stubborn, she\u2019s also willing to admit when she\u2019s wrong and she\u2019s willing to go against the norm for Aes Sedai, and be an example of what an Aes Sedai should be. Moiraine definitely deserves a spot on this list.\n8. **Geralt** (*The Witcher* Series by Andrzej Sapkowski): Geralt of Rivia is a man haunted by society's views on witchers. In order to become the mosnter slayer he is, he went through various mutations, because of these he\u2019s an outcast in a society that thinks he\u2019s an emotionless monster. And he sometimes struggles with believing this to be true. We learn a lot through his inner monologue, He\u2019s an incredibly deep character and this only becomes more apparent as the books go on. Geralt's dry sarcastic humor and the sort of father-daughter relationship he has with Ciri are two of my favorite things of the series.\n9. **Logen Ninefingers** (*The First Law by Joe Abercrombie*) - The most feared man in the North, Logen is a barbarian with a dark past. Ironically, he really doesn't care much for fighting. He wants to be a better person, he wants to turn from the path of senseless violence he's followed. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he's bloody brilliant.\n10. **Samwise Gamgee** (LOTR): everyone wants a friend as good as Sam! Without Sam's loyalty and courage, the One Ring would never have been destroyed so he's pretty much the real hero. He's not as powerful as any of the other characters on this list, but he's one of the best sidekick characters there ever was.\n\n**There's so many amazing characters I didn't mention so let me know your top 10!** Here's some of my honorable mentions: \n\n\\-Aragorn (Lord of The Rings)  \n\\-Drizzt Do'Urden (Legend of Drizzt series by R.A. Salvatore)  \n\\-Jasnah Kholin (The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson)  \n\\-Kaladin Stormblessed (The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson)  \n\\-Lightsong (Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson)  \n\\-Locke Lamorra (Gentleman Bastards by Scott Lynch)  \n\\-Shallan (The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson)  \n\\-Thomas Senlin (Books of Babel by Josiah Bancroft)"

I also wanted to make an effort to write something down after reading every book and wanted to share them with someone and I don't really have that many friends who read. Because I mostly read fantasy, I decided to share these with you guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wayfinder by Kaitlin Bellamy** *(Mapweaver chronicles book 3)*\n\n4.5 / 5\n\nA beautiful enthralling journey with Fox has come to an end and I cannot wait for the next one.\n\nThis book captured me as all of Fox's journeys have and I'm left wanting for more. I have cried and laughed and lived through many a vivid story - Kaitlin's writing is like the Shavid storytelling that draw colours out of thin air and makes you truly see the story.\n\nI'll be waiting for the next journey to take me into the unknown realms.\n\nAbsolutely recommend you guys to go read the first book in this series **Windswept.**\n\n**Kingmaker by Kaitlin Bellamy** *(Mapweaver chronicles book 4)*\n\n5 / 5\n\nFox is back! I love it! I had chills and tears of joy within the first chapter. I was so glad to return this world again.\n\nThe book made me laugh, cry (of joy and sadness) and huff in exasperation. It made me bite my nails and hold my breath in expectation. It was an emotional rollercoaster and I cannot wait for the next book!\n\n*Bingo slot: Novel published in 2020 / Self-Published Novel*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Golem and the Jinni by Helene Wecker**\n\n4+ / 5\n\nThe book was refreshing and definitely very different from the books I\u2019ve read before in terms of protagonists and setting. So the story is mostly set in NYC in 1899 and some of the story happens in The Syrian Desert. It deals mostly with immigrants and being an outsider in the new continent and culture.\n\nMain characters are literally a Golem and a Jinni, which was so interesting to me that the protagonists would be something else than a regular human. Chava, the golem, was a refreshing female character with a good arc and Jinni was what I\u2019d think Jinni would be like, but I also love his growth through the book.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who wants to read a book from a different perspective.\n\n*Bingo slot: could be ace/aro (the golem is aromantic/asexual)* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Catharsis by Travis Bagwell** *(Awaken Online 1)*\n\n3- / 5\n\nMy first go at LitRPG genre and I was pleasantly surprised. It was such a fast and easy read at a time when I needed exactly that. Sometimes you want to read something easy and entertaining, that maybe isn\u2019t the best book ever. A palate cleanser, if you will. I found characters to be a bit lacking and the story too, but I still enjoyed the journey.\n\nI\u2019m not sure, if I will read the other books in the series, but I still think this was definitely worth my time plus a step out of my usual picks in fantasy.\n\nI think I would recommend this to someone who hasn't read LitRPG before and wants to give it a go.\n\n*Bingo slot: Novel featuring Necromancy (Hard-Mode)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow**\n\n4- / 5\n\nAn in-between girl in the world dominated by wealthy white men, a girl who really doesn\u2019t know who she is and where she belongs, and a book about a book.\n\nI loved the fact that the protagonist was a female, a well-written one!, and that she was also POC. I loved that the magic in the book is something less obvious and when it comes to play it's quite different to what I'm used to.\n\nI'd recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a well-written female lead or a book about books.\n\n*Bingo slot: Book about books (Hard-mode)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden** *(Winternight trilogy 1)*\n\n5 / 5\n\nSometimes you can tell by just reading the first chapter, that you\u2019ve stumbled onto something great and different to what you\u2019ve used to seeing in Fantasy. This was one of those books.\n\nI don\u2019t recall reading fantasy before that was set in Russia and had real Russian folklore elements and animism in it. I found this very refreshing.\n\nVasilisa, the main character, is also something I don\u2019t encounter that often in fantasy, a very-well written female protagonist, that defies the gender roles set in the society. (And who is also not a teenage-assassin and Her story doesn\u2019t revolve around romance either.)\n\nIt's an in-between sort of book, not quite YA and not quite adult.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone, who loves animism in fantasy and to anyone who loves a well-written female protagonist.\n\n*Bingo slot: Setting featuring snow, ice or cold*\n\n**The Girl in the Tower by Katherine Arden** *(Winternight trilogy 2)*\n\n5 / 5\n\nAnother great book by Katherine Arden that tackles the male centrist worldview and makes Vasilisa challenge that headlong.\n\nI put the book down every two pages to roll my eyes or to huff in exasperation due to the characters being written so well that they make me want to scream at them for making all the wrong choices or being too na\u00efve. On the other hand, making me giddy and weep tears of joy at how beautifully written this book is. - That\u2019s a sign of a good story.\n\n*Bingo slot: feminist novel or Setting featuring ice or cold*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mistborn: The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson** *(Mistborn trilogy era 1)*\n\n4.5 / 5\n\nLet\u2019s just start off by saying, I\u2019ve avoided Sanderson for a very long time, because I always thought he was overrated and that I rather wanted to read indie fantasy that isn\u2019t on everyone\u2019s lips, because usually the true gems can be found there. Well, I was wrong, Sanderson is a bloody good writer.\n\nIt took me embarrassingly long to read this book. I started the book in November 2019 and couldn\u2019t for the life of me get past 90 pages. I found the beginning so boring and Vin such a bland character that I felt like I forgot everything in a day and had to start over. Then in April, during lockdown, I decided that I should give this one another go. I didn\u2019t start over but rather kept going on from where I had left off\u2026 And wouldn\u2019t you believe \u2013 I loved it so much I couldn\u2019t stop reading. I fell in love with the world, allomancy and the characters.\n\nI think the beginning was super slow and didn't really encage me, but as the story started progressing I really enjoyed it.\n\n*Bingo slot: Novel with Chapter Epigraphs or Novel featuring politics*\n\n**The Well of Ascension by Brandon Sanderson** *(Mistborn trilogy era 1)*\n\n5 / 5\n\nI got super immersed in this book and I think it has to be my favourite one of the trio. I love Sazed and the fact that we get other POVs than Vin's.\n\nI had to put alarms to my phone to wrench me out of reading and doing stuff like sleeping or anything productive really. After I finished this one I had to stop myself from jumping straight to the third book at 4am.\n\nI'm really liking Sanderson's style and I think I'll read more from him later on. I'm also super glad that I decided to stick with the first book after the slow start because the story seems to be getting better and better.\n\n**The Hero of the Ages by Brandon Sanderson** *(Mistborn trilogy era 1)*\n\n5- / 5\n\nTowards the end I was really suffering. I didn't want the story to be over, but I also needed to know what will eventually happen and how will all things resolve. Who is the author of the chapter epigraphs? So many questions, and so many theories! I had to stop and theorize between chapters and to try and make connections. Also that feeling when you've got something right in your crazy theories!!\n\nThis was one of the most fulfilling endings to a trilogy and I was in tears by the end of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski** *(a collective review)*\n\n4.5 / 5 (individual books rated between 4 and 5 stars)\n\nI'm familiar with Witcher through the videogames and lately the Netflix show. I love the games and Geralt, so I was excited to get my hands on the books before quarantine. I read the books in Finnish and I think the translation was suberb. I tried reading the English translation and that felt a bit clumsy to me.\n\nI really, really liked the books. I might be biased, because I was already attached to most of the characters through other mediums but I think the books were a lot better than any other form (no surprises there).\n\nI think Sapkowski wrote Ciri very well and that's why my favourite books from the seiries were The Tower of the Swallow and the Lady of the Lake.\n\nThere's lots of violence (physical, sexual and mental), gore and sex and some of the things made me queasy, so if you are easily triggered by those things, maybe steer clear from these books. I think those were justified by the setting and the situation in the world and I didn't feel like they were there just because the author likes those sorts of thinga. I've sufferd through some sexual violence myself and I think it made me feel for the characters even more. I also think the characters used those things to their advance without forgetting the trauma.\n\nI would recommend to anyone who loves monsters, medieval fantasy or Witcher things in general. I cannot speak for the English translation, but at least the Finnish translation was superb.\n\n*Bingo slot: Novel with Chapter Epigraphs or Novel translated from its original language*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've read a couple of non-fantasy books as well, but didn't think they'd fit in this sub. Lets discuss in the comments. I would also appreciate good recommendations for the exploration slot in the bingo.  I'm a tad lost with that one! (I've read all the Narnia books and the Fifth Season by N.K. Jeminisin already)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** As u/zebba_oz suggested, I edited this to include what bingo slots these could be used. I personally will not use these all for my bingo card, but some of them :) Hope this helps somebody!"

These books share a sort of old-timey fairytale and comforting style.\n\n### The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley\n\n>*This is the story of Corlath, golden-eyed king of the Free Hillfolk, son of the sons of the Lady Aerin.*  \n*And this is the story of Harry Crewe, the Homelander orphan girl who became Harimad-sol, King's Rider, and heir to the Blue Sword, Gonturan, that no woman had wielded since the Lady Aerin herself bore it into battle.*  \n*And this is the song of the kelar of the Hillfolk, the magic of the blood, the weaver of destinies...*\n\nRead this for a book club a million years ago (=this May) but never got round to organizing my scrambled notes into a coherent review.\n\nI really liked the beginning of this book and how it set the scene and described the world. The focus shifts between past and present to give us context. The audiobook narration and prose style also gave it an old-timey story-telling vibe, it worked very well read out loud, so would rec the audio here.\n\nWe read this for HEA bookclub on r/fantasy, so I was expecting it to be pretty romance heavy, turns out it was more a case of \"book by a woman\" marketed/shelved as romance, than anything to do with the book. There was a bit sure, but pretty understated, wouldn't have called it the focus of the book.\n\nI can see plenty of criticism for this book, the portrayal of colonialism is sketchy, with a helping of the white savior, is pretty yikes, but overall I enjoyed it, somewhere around 3 - 3.5 /5.  \nIt's got the restless young girl discovered powerful magic in her blood trope that is basically Dia bait, and I really wished this has been recced to me when I was younger as I would have loved it a lot more.\n\n[Goodreads ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/407813.The_Blue_Sword)\n\n### The Last Herald-Mage by Mercedes Lackey\n\n>*Vanyel has been born with near-legendary abilities that, if left untrained, may prove a menace not only to Vanyel but to others as well. So he is sent to his aunt, Savil, one of the fame Herald-Mages of Valdemar. Soon he will become the focus of frightening forces and raw magic. And by the time Savil seeks the assistance of a Shin\u2019a\u2019in Adept, Vanyel\u2019s wild talent may have already grown beyond anyone\u2019s ability to contain, placing Valdemar in desperate peril.*\n\nThis trilogy is super intense, a lot about personal change, a lot about being very tired. Really, most of my comments as I was reading come down to \"please won't somebody let this man rest? he needs a two-week nap\". There's also an ominous feeling all along if you've read The Heralds of Valdemar trilogy before this, because that story opens with the legend of Vanyel, so we know from the start where this is going. There's also a lot of in-book prophecy and foreshadowing. Overall I found it very easy to read and hard to put down.\n\nThis trilogy is set some hundred years before Talia's books, and I really liked getting all that historical background, and especially the parts over what was forgotten and what passed into myth.\n\nBook 1 starts with Vanyel, a little lordling boy who everyone picks on at home, doesn't really have any friends and few allies. So he puts on this persona of not caring and being a bit of an ass. I thought it would follow the same sort of pattern as the previous trilogy I'd read in this series, especially as it starts with a kid with a tough family life, so I was surprised at how different the first book ended up being, compared to The Arrows of the Queen. It was great seeing him slowly come out of the shell he'd constructed for himself and how much Vanyel changed. It was also a very emotional first book.\n\nI want to say that book 2 is mostly about Vanyel settling into his role as herald, I really do. Unfortunately for him, book 2 is really about Vanyel getting more and tired and very few chances for a rest. Shit keeps hitting multiple fans and often it seems Vanyel's the only one who can clean up the mess.\u00a0When we reach book 3, Vanyel is pretty a\u00a0 one-man country defense system, a very very exhausted one, almost always running on fumes.\n\nI don't want to give away too much of the book, but if you were shipping Geralt and Jaskier in the Witcher TV show, Mercedes Lackey's got you covered.\n\nBy the time I got to the ending, I had spent 3 whole books bracing myself. And still, I don't think I'd had such an ugly cry at a book in over 10 years, even remembering the final parts of this trilogy is making me tear up. It was so emotional. I really liked how things came together, and besides the big objectives, there were some really nice personal payoffs too.\n\n[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34452792-the-last-herald-mage)\n\n### Od Magic by Patricia McKillip\n\n>*Brenden Vetch has a gift. With an innate sense he cannot explain to himself or describe to others, he connects to the agricultural world, nurturing gardens to flourish and instinctively knowing the healing properties each plant and herb has to offer. But Brenden's gift isolates him from people--and from becoming part of a community.Until the day he receives a personal invitation from the wizard Od. She needs a gardener for her school in the great city of Kelior, where every potential wizard must be trained to serve the Kingdom of Numis. For decades the rulers of Numis have controlled the school, believing they can contain the power within it--and punish any wizard who dares defy the law.But unknown to the reigning monarchy is the power possessed by the school's new gardener--a power that even Brenden isn't fully aware of, and which is the true reason Od recruited him...*\n\nI liked this book because it was pretty chill, very fairytale-like, and most of the time the stakes were personal. The three main characters just want to be themselves and do their thing without fear. Brenden just wants to garden, Sulys just wants to practice her small magic and Mistral just wants to make a living. But men's fear and need to control magic and power won't let that happen. I've only ever read one other book by McKillip, The Forgotten Beasts of Eld, but I can see some similarities in the fairy-tale style, I'm sure the audiobook narration contributed there, and the just wanting to be left in peace theme.\n\nThe story opens with Brenden meeting Od, who sends him to her magic school in the big city. So I thought, oh magic school book! And I found it interesting how it both is and isn't. A significant part takes place at a magic school, but we only get PoVs from the staff and teachers, there are none of the usual student life aspects. I really liked this play on a common trope.\n\nI thought the antagonists were a bit too consumed by their obsessions and not seeing reason, believable, just unpleasant.\n\nI really liked the magic parts, there's a strong sense of wonder and unknown about what magic is and what it can do. There's a magic school so you think these guys would be experts but really so much of the book focuses on learning what it is they don't know. I would love a chance to explore the mysterious twilight quarter.\n\n[Goodreads\u00a0](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19823.Od_Magic?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=30QsMro5b2&rank=1)\n\n[*Originally posted on my blog*](https://dianthaa.com/2020/09/05/od-magic-the-blue-sword-the-last-herald-mage-valdemar-shortish-reviews/)"

        "body": "Let me just introduce the context of my reading: I first read **The Last Wish**, but did not like the format; after seeking advice here on r/Fantasy, I decided to plunge straight into the first novel. Maybe it played its part in my appreciation of the book, you'll tell me. I might be mixing those two volumes in my review, because they are part of the same universe, and therefore share some features like worldbuilding, for example. I believe I have nothing spoilery so no tagging, but feel free to correct me!\n\nBlurb:\n\n>For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf.  \nGeralt of Rivia, the cunning assassin known as The Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child. This child has the power to change the world - for good, or for evil.\n\nI guess the **TL;DR** here is that I did not like this book. It's a **2/5** for me: I'm not actively regretting spending time reading it, but I forced myself to finish it and did not enjoy it. So here is why:\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* This was the biggest disapointment to me. They felt shallow: Geralt is over powered, and I think that feature in itself does not leave much room for a nuanced character; he is always the most in every situation, and particularly so regarding seduction, because every female character has sex with him (and even though all of them are consensual, which is great, a grown man bedding 17-16 year-old girls ends up being downright weird if not uncomfortable).\n* I know it is called \"The Witcher\" for a reason, and ultimately it is going to revolve around him as a main character... but I can't help but feel it is a tad too much here. The author has a tendency to describe Geralt through the eyes of every single character he meets, to give us that first shiver again and again. In short, the fact that every single character revolves around Geralt (for jealousy, for love, for fear or for hate) annoys me. It feels they are all there just to make him look better/smarter/more hansome, etc, and they end up being fairly interchangeable.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nEven though it is the #3 in the saga, I think this is really a first book: that is where it is really set up. You are introduced to some history of the world, the different races of sentient beings, their interests in the war that is going to follow... So in a way, not a lot happens in this volume, but that was really not what bothered me. We follow Ciri's progression and her training, which is generally a well-appreciated moment.\n\n**Worldbuilding:**\n\n* Like the characters, the world seemed to be all surface and no depth, but maybe I carried this impression from the 1st volume, where it was really evident. The world is supposed to be very extensive and complex, but most of it is just names, and makes it mere background. Not that every book needs to be heavily political and complex, mind you, but if it's going to be background, treat it as such and don't pretend the reader needs to remember names and places and collect data for future relevance. Maybe what reinforced this impression is the fact that Geralt has a reputation everywhere, which is not logical if the world is supposed to be that huge.\n* The magic is not explained, and gave me the impression of popping up when convenient. There are no(t many) limits to its uses, and this lack of boundaries did not help me form an interest.\n\n**Pacing:**\n\nI liked it a lot better than The Last Wish, where it was just a string of adventures. I appreciated the slice-of-life moments where Ciri trains, and overall it builds up nicely to more and more tension.\n\n**Prose:**\n\n* I had the book in French, but also listened to some parts of the English audiobook, and neither of those is the original language; I wonder how much is lost in translation, and we have to bear this in mind.\n* The descriptions are nice, they really produce an atmosphere, and it helps anchor the plot in a place and a time. The characters and the landscapes are easy to visualize, and all that in a concise way that rarely gets too much and boring.\n* However, the amount of dialogue vs. description/action is such that the audiobook ended up giving me headaches. Especially in the debate scenes, they dragged on and on, and I couldn't see the point of that.\n\nSo, short of ripping me apart, tell me what you think: where do you agree and disagree? Did you love it, hate it, mehed it? Have I missed something that would have made me enjoy it?\n\n**To conclude, I would say it is recommended if you like:** mentor-mentee relationships, progression fantasy, chosen one trope, over-powered character, epic fantasy.\n\n**Bingo 2020:** translated, epigraphs, politics."

He is in fact a reference to a Stephen King character that appears in some of his books and goes by many names (Randall Flagg) and two of those combined make Gaunter O Dimm. Yet Gaunter is more interesting to me. \n\n He's supposed to be a demon and he seems to have no limits to what he can do, yet he's bound to its own nature and can be tricked.\n\nThe thing I love about him is that he looks like a totally ordinary man, a \"merchant of mirrors\" and interacts with the world but doesn't show off or threaten. Yet every single word coming from him is weighed and has a very specific meaning. If you read his dialogues carefully you'll notice.\n\nHe rarely kills people and when he does no one has a clue except the ones he choses. I love when someone interrupted him while he was talking to Geralt, so he stopped time, put a fly on man's soup and pushed a wooden spoon in the drunk's brain who annoyed him from his eye socket as it was nothing."

The complex situations that characters get into and what they ultimately take away from them is meant just as much for the reader as it is for the fictional character, and I think there's a lot you can gain from your favorite characters.\n\nHere are mine in no particular order:\n\n1. **Fitzchivalry Farseer** (*The Farseer Trilogy* by Robin Hobb): I feel like I've been inside Fitz's head, I've related to him, I've been through the wringer with him, He\u2019s got some issues, he lacks self worth, and has feelings of failure, and sure, I might get frustrated with how blind he can sometimes be to others motivations. But it\u2019s weaknesses like this that makes his character feel so real. He will always be one of my all time favorites. Also the Fool and Nighteyes, as what would Fitz be without them?\n2. **Vin** (*Mistborn Trilogy* by Brandon Sanderson): The Mistborn books by Brando Sando are a lot of fun! They have one of the best magic systems I've read and they also have some fantastic characters, vin being one of my favorites. Like Fitz, Vin also starts out as the ultimate underdog and I\u2019m a sucker for underdog stories. When we first meet Vin as an orphan surviving on the ash covered streets of Luthadel, where she\u2019s very untrusting and tries to make herself as unsuspecting and  invisible as possible. Over the course of the books she has some great character growth and is given some incredible action scenes, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s Vin's internal struggles and how much growth she goes through over the course of the books that are a huge part of why I love her character! It takes her some time to grow, which I think was done so well and is very realistic.\n3. **Dalinar Kholin** (*The Stormlight Archive series* by Brandon Sanderson): Dalinar is has one of Sanderson\u2019s very best character arcs in my opinion. He was a terrible person, he committed warcrimes, he's a former warlord turned peacemaker, but nobody trusts him now because of all the murdering he did when he was The Blackthorn. Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing. Not only is he a brilliant character, but he is inspiring to the reader.\n4. **Kvothe** (*The Kingkiller Chronicle* by Patrick Rothfuss): Kvothe goes through immense personal tragedy, and turns to music and learning to cope with this. He's definitely a polarizing character. While he's a genius in some regards, he's also a complete idiot sometimes. He makes immensely reckless decisions that endanger everyone around him, and he often messes things up and is the cause of all of his problems. He can be arrogant and lets his pride and anger get the better of him. The stories told about Kvothe are hugely overblown and sometimes far from the truth. In fact he often stretches the truth to inflate his legendary status. His flaws are undeniable, which is why I don't agree when some people refer to him as a Mary Sue/Gary Stu character. It took me a good re-read or two to really notice the extent of Kvothe\u2019s flaws, but it's these flaws, and the mystery behind his situation in the present day, that make him such an interesting character.\n5. **Glokta** (*The First Law* books by Joe Abercrombie): Glokta was a character I wasn't expecting to like so much. He's not a character you like because he's nice, you like him because he's interesting and just oozes character. Glokta was once a talented swordsman before being captured and brutaslly tortured for 3 years. He's now a crippled bitter shell of the man he used to be, and a tortuerer himself working as one of the king's inquisitors. Glokta lives a miserable life where even the simple act of climbing stairs or getting out of bed is a painful and frustrating ordeal. He has some hilarious inner monologues, and is just such a unique character.\n6. **Rand Al'Thor** (*Wheel of Time* by Robert Jordan): I'm new to WoT and only on book 5. There's not a lot I can say about Rand without spoiling things, but while there's a lot of characters I've been enjoying in the series, Rand is still the one I care about the most and who I find the most compelling. All the stuff he goes through is enough to make anyone crazy, though he has more of an excuse than most people.\n7. **Moiraine Damodred** (*Wheel of Time* by Robert Jordan): Again only 5 books in, but Moiraine is amazing. I agree with Daniel Greene when he says she feels like an evolution of Gandalf, she fits into that old wise wizard trope but brings it to the next level. There\u2019s a lot to respect about her, she\u2019s a very mysterious and powerful character, she\u2019s able to keep her head in whatever situation is thrown at her. While stubborn, she\u2019s also willing to admit when she\u2019s wrong and she\u2019s willing to go against the norm for Aes Sedai, and be an example of what an Aes Sedai should be. Moiraine definitely deserves a spot on this list.\n8. **Geralt** (*The Witcher* Series by Andrzej Sapkowski): Geralt of Rivia is a man haunted by society's views on witchers. In order to become the mosnter slayer he is, he went through various mutations, because of these he\u2019s an outcast in a society that thinks he\u2019s an emotionless monster. And he sometimes struggles with believing this to be true. We learn a lot through his inner monologue, He\u2019s an incredibly deep character and this only becomes more apparent as the books go on. Geralt's dry sarcastic humor and the sort of father-daughter relationship he has with Ciri are two of my favorite things of the series.\n9. **Logen Ninefingers** (*The First Law by Joe Abercrombie*) - The most feared man in the North, Logen is a barbarian with a dark past. Ironically, he really doesn't care much for fighting. He wants to be a better person, he wants to turn from the path of senseless violence he's followed. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he's bloody brilliant.\n10. **Samwise Gamgee** (LOTR): everyone wants a friend as good as Sam! Without Sam's loyalty and courage, the One Ring would never have been destroyed so he's pretty much the real hero. He's not as powerful as any of the other characters on this list, but he's one of the best sidekick characters there ever was.\n\n**There's so many amazing characters I didn't mention so let me know your top 10!** Here's some of my honorable mentions: \n\n\\-Aragorn (Lord of The Rings)  \n\\-Drizzt Do'Urden (Legend of Drizzt series by R.A.

        "body": "Welcome to the end of the first 80% of the list. It's all downhill from here (both in terms of number of books to read and in the quality of my reviews)! Each month I will be reading 5 books from our [Top Novels of 2018 list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/907ty2/the_rfantasy_2018_top_novels_poll_results/) until I have read the starting book from each series. [When we last checked in](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/hrneka/climbing_mount_readmore_reading_our_top_fantasy/), I nearly finished 34-30. Now we go from 30 to 26:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**30. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke (24 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Magic is returning to England. With the stuffy Mr. Norrell preaching the virtues of academic magic and the boisterous, improvisational Jonathan Strange taking an opposite approach, London has never felt more lively as the two bicker over the proper ways to reintroduce magic to the country. But there is a mysterious foe, a fairy known as the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair who lurks menacingly behind the scenes and works to undo all that these two magicians hope to achieve.\n\nThe great thing about this book is, first and foremost, the extremely well realized characters. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are just fully fleshed out, memorable characters from the instant the appear in the book that they practically leap off the page. Even less three dimensional characters such as the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair are appropriately menacing and memorable in their roles. But the thing that makes the characters pop off of each other is how they conflict with each other in their various understandings of magic. See, JS&MN is a book about magic and is thematically very interested in exploring the differing approaches of its two leads: the systematic and practically scientific approach of Norrell versus the freewheeling and innovative anything goes approach of Strange. Yes, that's right, this book as about hard magic versus soft magic. What's remarkable is that, without ever picking a side, Clarke manages to portray both systems at their best and shows what they can do when they work in tandem while acknowledging a bit of natural animosity between the two schools of thought. Maybe this makes the book a bit too insular for readers from outside the fantasy genre but for anyone who has ever gotten stuck in a \"hard magic or soft magic?\" debate, it is wonderful to read a story that shows them as respectable equals that have their own strengths and weaknesses. And lastly, there is some marvelous humor in here if you happen to know your early 19th century British history. Clarke peppers in a lot of subtle jabs at trends and opinions of the times that are extremely gratifying to see if you know where to look. I'm not totally sure the historical setting is needed outright but those jokes go a long way to justifying them even if this story could be set at almost any time period in Britain as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThere is one very serious flaw here and that is that the first quarter of the book is tediously boring. But wait, how can I call this a great book and one of my favorites if I think close to 250 pages of it are a chore to read? A great question. I think the book largely makes up for the lengthy stumbling intro but I can't really blame anyone who couldn't power through the nearly novel length chunk of time where little happens. Some defend this beginning part by saying it makes sense that the section largely from stodgy Mr. Norrell's POV is dull but while it makes sense, I think it's a profoundly bad idea for any author to consciously make such a large sequence dull because it matches the character. It's okay to write about dull things in fun and interesting ways, it's preferred even! The best kind of writing is the kind that takes the dull and makes it interesting, not the kind that takes the dull and double checks to make sure it stays dull out of a misguided sense of tonal cohesion. Isn't half the fun of the movie Office Space that they managed to make a hilarious comedy out of the drudgery of meaningless office work? No one would want to watch Office Space if it decided to be as boring as actually working in an office was. And I wish Clarke had livened up this beginning because it does turn off many people who I believe would love the book if they could make it farther in.\n\nAll this is to say that I think JS&MN is a masterpiece. Highly flawed in some ways but still exceptional in enough other ways to make it a justified classic in my view. If you can soldier through the weak opening, you'll find a novel that opens up in countless interesting ways that's full of magic and charm that's hard to resist.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** A cat-squasher of a book with humor, memorable characters, and a lot to say about magic.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** Yes, this really feels like a world ripe for more exploration.\n\n**28.** **~~The Last Wish~~** **Blood of Elves by Andrzej Sapkowski, Book 3 of The Witcher (37 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Geralt of Rivia is sworn to protect Ciri, granddaughter of the King of Cintra, and a child of great power who is being targeted for assassination by an unknown foe.\n\n**ETA:** I initially had the wrong title written down here. A user correctly pointed out that I sounded like I had actually read Blood of Elves, not The Last Wish and sure enough, that's what I had read. Whoops.\n\nA common refrain among reviewers who come away from a book disappointed is \"I wanted to like this.\" It's kind of a silly thing to say because yeah, of course you did. Normal people don't actively wish to have a bad reading experience. The closest you get to that feelings is resignation because you don't expect to like something but even then that's more trepidation than hope. Which brings me to my feelings on the Witcher. I don't get the Witcher. Don't really care for the games, don't care for the tv show, and every description I've heard of the books makes them sound bland. A super powerful guy goes around killing monsters, sleeping with a ton of women, and has magical powers that require him to be completely emotionless? It sounds like all the least interesting aspects of power fantasy rolled into one and having an emotionless protagonist is almost always boring barring rare exceptions like when such a character is acted by Leonard Nimoy. So, in approaching this book, I was pretty worried I would not like this at all.\n\nLuckily, it turned out better than I expected. The novel has a really incredible sense for naturalistic pacing where everything seems to happen at the right time without feeling force or too quick or too slow. The prose is also lean and something else while still making room for some striking imagery where it can. The world, while a bit derivative with all the classic fantasy creatures, also feels somewhat fresh and filled with possibilities. Sapkowski manages to inject just enough novelty in his world to make it feel newer and more original than I think it would sound on paper. I also think there's a lot of interesting political and religious worldbuilding even if those elements are often relegated to the background. I would sometimes find myself pausing to mull over some of these little tidbits of information like the fascinating reveal in one chapter that wizards are mostly infertile and those that aren't are often forced to infertility by other jealous wizards. It's an interesting detail that implies a ton of character to the world and showcases an all too believable pettiness in these powerful masters that I found captivating.\n\nHowever, Geralt is exactly as boring as I was worried about and his boring nature is made all the worse by the fact that I'm not sure there's a single character in here who doesn't talk about how great Geralt is. Ciri's firs remark about Geralt is that he can make her believe things when no one else can, the bard Dandilion's first scene is of him singing Geralt's praises quite literally, Triss Merigold's first scene has her fantasizing about getting to sleep with Geralt. It just goes on and on, meanwhile Geralt's only actions for the first hundred and some pages of the book is to tell Ciri that bad dreams aren't worth worrying about. This is pretty disappointing example of how showing over telling can hamper a good premise. It would be far more compelling to see Geralt performing heroics and let us readers decide how awesome he is rather than have and endless string of side characters talk him up at length while he twiddles his thumbs. This also kind of leads into the problem that the plot feels unfocused. I can't tell how much of this is due to the non-linear storytelling of the novel (which I admire the ambition of but I am unclear on what it added to the actual plot. It kind of seemed like a gimmick rather than a necessary element) but very few of the threads in the story appeared to link back up and little changed from what I think the beginning of the story was to what the end of the story was. The book began with Ciri potentially having great powers and getting training for them while being the target of a nebulous plot to harm her and the book ended with all of that remaining the same and no information as to why Ciri was targeted being revealed. No relationships really changed during the book either except for Ciri's relationship to Yenneffer but their whole relationship began and concluded in the last chapter of the book, so I can't really call that a satisfying development.\n\nIt's certainly not a bad book and there are good elements here. Even the things I wasn't quite on board with (like the non-linear story) were at least motivated by a desire to tell an unconventional story which makes me want to cut this book more slack when compared to other books on this list that have failed for laziness but I can't say I have any desire to continue on with a main character this boring and a writing style this focused on telling over showing. I think this could be laying the groundwork for a more interesting story given how marvelous the worldbuilding seemed to be but I am also deeply disinterested in the main character so I'm not sure an interesting world is enough to compel me to read the next entry. I can see why it appeals to some but it ultimately just wasn't for me.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** It's an ambitious work that hints at a spectacular world to unfold in later stories. The real reason it's on the list though is because the video games are popular.\n* **Would you continue on?** Probably not.\n\n**28. The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison (same position on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Maia has lived his whole life as an estranged outcast until his father's death when he is ushered to the capital and crowned as the next emperor. Through an unfamiliar political terrain, assassination attempts, and his own scarred past, Maia must find a way to become a better ruler than even he believes he is capable of being.\n\nAs this is a slice of life novel, there is less focus on a conventional plot and more focus on the development of the main character as Maia works through his emotional struggles with ruling and tries to acclimate to the capital. I've seen a number of people get frustrated with this softer plot focus but I personally feel it works well for the type of story being told. Maia is a cinnamon roll of a character who just wants to do well and for everyone to get along and who is so unprepared for what he is getting into but still manages to win over a few crucial allies through his unassuming nature and pure lack of guile. Thematically, the story is most interested in the importance of emotional connection which in some ways makes it a bit of an anti-conflict book as the resolutions to most situations in the book come not from battles or fights but from small acts of kindness or generosity. In fact, the biggest emotional touchstone of the novel is arguably Maia forgiving someone who had hurt him when he was younger where most other fantasy books would have their emotional climax at a battle or with two characters falling in love. The lower key approach and emphasis on community and empathy makes the book spectacular comfort reading.\n\nThe obvious weakness here is that the slice of life approach can leave the book feeling meandering and plotless to people who prioritize action over character. I personally think Addison manages to sprinkle in more than enough action to keep even those of us with weaker tolerances for slice of life reading interested but I'm sure that's not a universal truth. I've also heard the complaint that the names in this book are hard to remember and the counterargument that the names are purposefully hard to simulate the experience Maia is going through of being in over his head in a foreign land. Personally, neither argument really resonates with me as someone who has always been terrible with names. These names didn't seem noticeably harder than usual fantasy names to me and I of course completely forgot all of them anyway. All I can say is that while I was reading it was pretty easy for me to go \"oh yeah, that guy!\" so I'm not sure it really added the layer of challenge that others have said it does but it's a common complaint so I figured it was worth listing here. There's probably also an argument to be made that it's politically naive to have a story where all it takes to solve deeply entrenched political problems is kindness and empathy but honestly, I think the genre could use a little more of this kind of wish fulfillment and a little less traditional power fantasy so I can't hold this bit against the book.\n\nThis is one that I personally think is great but it is so different from the types of books that usually get popular on this sub that I'm not totally sure how a new reader would feel coming to it. It's absolutely worth reading but I think it's important to be prepared for it to be a very different kind of reading experience than epic fantasy fans are used to.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** An uplifting book about the power of dedicating yourself to your task and building camaraderie.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** Yes and I think this story lends itself well towards easy sequelizing. You don't even have to stick with the current ruler, just random stories about managing the bureaucracy of this unique world would be enough.\n\n**26. Lions of al-Rassan by Guy Gavriel Kay (42 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>On a peninsula divided in a religious war between Jaddites and Asharites, the future of the land will be shaped by three people. Rodrigo Belmonte, ferocious commander of Jaddite forces, Ammar ibn Khairan, poet and regicide, and Jehane, doctor and member of the Kindath minority that is persecuted by both sides. The unlikely friendship between these three will shape events to come as the inevitably must choose sides in the fight between al-Rassan and Esperana.\n\nThis is probably GGK's best book. I have to admit I'm far less certain after having read Sailing to Sarantium though I can't be certain until I get a free moment to check out Lord of Emperors, but this is the standalone that works best. Thematically, the novel explores the time period known in our world as the Reconquista, when Spain fought against Muslim conquerers to reclaim the Iberian peninsula over a period of hundreds of years. GGK condenses this period down to about 20 years and only portrays two of those 20 in this book for the sake of keeping the work standalone. His primary concern is exploring the cyclical religious violence as each side uses the other side's previous atrocities as justification for committing further atrocities and in sympathizing with the Kindath (an analogue of Jewish people) that are caught in between and despised by both sides. In spite of those enmities. most of the book is spent developing the friendships of representatives from each of the major religions of the region and each of them is fairly well developed. Jehane and ibn Khairan are probably the most complex characters as Belmonte is a little too morally pure for the type of story being told (though from what I gather this does seem to be fairly close to how the person his character was based on behaved) but he is still a likable character and it is nice to see a character who treats all of the people of the region well. Naturally, when you've got three religious groups that can't get along, the story isn't going to have a perfectly happy conclusion though GGK does manage an interesting threading of the needle where the ending feels far more optimistic and happier than it could have wound up.\n\nThere aren't a lot of complaints I have here. The biggest is just that I think ibn Khairan and Belmonte's relationship isn't as well developed as it needs to be for this story to truly shine. They share remarkably little screen time and rarely converse with each other though characters repeatedly state that they clearly respect each other greatly. Jehand, as the woman caught between them, is often used a proxy for their relationship with her intense feelings for both of them being used as something of a substitute for showing a deeper relationship between the two male leads. We care that these men might wind up as enemies who will have to kill each other because Jehane cares about them and doesn't want to lose either of them but neither of them has spent enough time with the other in the book for an organic feeling, convincing relationship to form. And yes, this does technically count as something of a love triangle so I assume there are readers who will be turned off from the novel solely for that reason.\n\nSo if you're a fan of historical fantasy, tragedy, and think you might like the works of GGK, this is probably the best place to start with his books.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** It's a wonderfully tragic tale about conflicting loyalties and religious extremism.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** I'm not sure where the characters could go from here but yes.\n\n**26. The Black Company by Glen Cook, Book 1 of the Chronicles of the Black Company (30 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>The Lady has risen from her tomb and seeks to conquer the world. To that end, she has hired the mercenary group known as the Black Company to serve her needs. As the company handles the darkest work and helps the Lady as she crushes the rebellion that seeks to stop her, the company's historian, Croaker, grows ever more enamored with service to this dark ruler even as he fears for his and his friends' lives under her rule. Can the Black Company survive service to one of the greatest evils that ever walked the earth?\n\nThere are so few things like the Black Company in epic fantasy, even among the books that drew inspiration from Black Company, that it's easy to get hyperbolic with praise quickly. From it's effortless sense of scope and scale, to the morally gray but still easy to like characters, and the unique worldbuilding that somehow does in 200 pages what most fantasy authors think they're doing in 600, it's just an impressive work all around. Croaker and his strange relationship to the dictatorial Lady is fascinating to follow along with as he struggles between his interest in her and his disgust with both her actions and himself for being in her employ. The use of magic in this world is also something I appreciate in that it seems to ever only come in flavors of great and terrible from the way the Lady can literally steal her enemy's souls and convert them to her cause to the way the Taken that she creates can use the magic carpet they have on hand to produce seriously devastating aerial bombardments. Cook is also very skilled at tone, being able to move fairly effortlessly between the kind of gallows humor that soldiers are sometimes known for, the creepiness and horror of the scenes with the Taken, and the more lighthearted moments when the Company gets time off to themselves and try to forget the part they're playing in destroying the freedom fighters who oppose the Lady.\n\nThe downsides of Black Company are effectively inverses of what makes it so good. 200 pages is too short for some people to get sucked in, it leaves very little room for meaningful character development so if you don't like the characters at the beginning all the much, they won't be changing too significantly. I've also heard the opinion that epic fantasy doesn't truly feel epic if it doesn't take up enough page and while I don't think Black Company quite falls into this failing, I can definitely see how a trilogy that's shorter in total than many single entries of other epic fantasy works might not feel suitably epic.\n\nThis review turned out a lot shorter than I expected but I guess it fits for the subject matter. Black Company is well worth a read and with such a short length, even if you don't like the story you at least won't have much of your time wasted.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** A truly unique epic fantasy with plenty of action and adventure.\n* **Would you continue on?** In a heartbeat.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd that's it for this month!

        "body": "Let me just introduce the context of my reading: I first read **The Last Wish**, but did not like the format; after seeking advice here on r/Fantasy, I decided to plunge straight into the first novel. Maybe it played its part in my appreciation of the book, you'll tell me. I might be mixing those two volumes in my review, because they are part of the same universe, and therefore share some features like worldbuilding, for example. I believe I have nothing spoilery so no tagging, but feel free to correct me!\n\nBlurb:\n\n>For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf.  \nGeralt of Rivia, the cunning assassin known as The Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child. This child has the power to change the world - for good, or for evil.\n\nI guess the **TL;DR** here is that I did not like this book. It's a **2/5** for me: I'm not actively regretting spending time reading it, but I forced myself to finish it and did not enjoy it. So here is why:\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* This was the biggest disapointment to me. They felt shallow: Geralt is over powered, and I think that feature in itself does not leave much room for a nuanced character; he is always the most in every situation, and particularly so regarding seduction, because every female character has sex with him (and even though all of them are consensual, which is great, a grown man bedding 17-16 year-old girls ends up being downright weird if not uncomfortable).\n* I know it is called \"The Witcher\" for a reason, and ultimately it is going to revolve around him as a main character... but I can't help but feel it is a tad too much here. The author has a tendency to describe Geralt through the eyes of every single character he meets, to give us that first shiver again and again. In short, the fact that every single character revolves around Geralt (for jealousy, for love, for fear or for hate) annoys me. It feels they are all there just to make him look better/smarter/more hansome, etc, and they end up being fairly interchangeable.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nEven though it is the #3 in the saga, I think this is really a first book: that is where it is really set up. You are introduced to some history of the world, the different races of sentient beings, their interests in the war that is going to follow... So in a way, not a lot happens in this volume, but that was really not what bothered me. We follow Ciri's progression and her training, which is generally a well-appreciated moment.\n\n**Worldbuilding:**\n\n* Like the characters, the world seemed to be all surface and no depth, but maybe I carried this impression from the 1st volume, where it was really evident. The world is supposed to be very extensive and complex, but most of it is just names, and makes it mere background. Not that every book needs to be heavily political and complex, mind you, but if it's going to be background, treat it as such and don't pretend the reader needs to remember names and places and collect data for future relevance. Maybe what reinforced this impression is the fact that Geralt has a reputation everywhere, which is not logical if the world is supposed to be that huge.\n* The magic is not explained, and gave me the impression of popping up when convenient. There are no(t many) limits to its uses, and this lack of boundaries did not help me form an interest.\n\n**Pacing:**\n\nI liked it a lot better than The Last Wish, where it was just a string of adventures. I appreciated the slice-of-life moments where Ciri trains, and overall it builds up nicely to more and more tension.\n\n**Prose:**\n\n* I had the book in French, but also listened to some parts of the English audiobook, and neither of those is the original language; I wonder how much is lost in translation, and we have to bear this in mind.\n* The descriptions are nice, they really produce an atmosphere, and it helps anchor the plot in a place and a time. The characters and the landscapes are easy to visualize, and all that in a concise way that rarely gets too much and boring.\n* However, the amount of dialogue vs. description/action is such that the audiobook ended up giving me headaches. Especially in the debate scenes, they dragged on and on, and I couldn't see the point of that.\n\nSo, short of ripping me apart, tell me what you think: where do you agree and disagree? Did you love it, hate it, mehed it? Have I missed something that would have made me enjoy it?\n\n**To conclude, I would say it is recommended if you like:** mentor-mentee relationships, progression fantasy, chosen one trope, over-powered character, epic fantasy.\n\n**Bingo 2020:** translated, epigraphs, politics."

She's currently reading \"Triss\" and I've got the next 3 in the series ready for her.  \n\nHer 9th birthday is coming up in Sept, and since Covid isn't allowing for in person birthdays with friends, I'd like to throw her a Redwall themed birthday party.  I'm looking for suggestions for a proper Redwall feast! Drink, soup, app, main course, and of course dessert!  Also if you know of any fun poems/songs/readings from the books I can read to her, please let me know.  Our favorite characters to voice are the moles, and I must say we've both gotten pretty good at molespeak!\n\nThanks all"

        "body": "So I noticed a tendency in modern works of fantasy fiction, specially the ones written by male authors, to have their protagonists to be \"studs\", meaning men who seem to elicit the sexual and/or romantic interest of a surprisingly amount of female characters almost immediately and along the course of the story proceed to get with them almost always.Some subgenres are more prone to depict their heroes like this, for example sword & sorcery, where it's basically a trope at this point. The female characters that become involved with the hero usually fall into the tropes of the archetypical damsel in distress or the femme fatale, and sometimes they don't even play a relevant role in the story, appearing only to add romantic/sexual prowess to the hero's already larger-than-life attributes.\n\nNow, I'm not against this trope, I actually enjoy fiction that depicts the characters' romantic and sexual lives very much; nor am I saying that the authors or works  that feature this trope are necessarily sexist or misogynistic in any way. Some of they might be, some of they may not. But it's definitely very male-gazey. And this is purely hypothetical but I think there may be an element of self-insertion and wish-fulfilment by their authors.\n\nIn Western culture there's also a \"tradition\" of this going back to mythology. For example, most if not virtually all male gods of the Greek pantheon were \"breeders\", siring many offsprings with numerous women, whether by seduction, extortion or force (consent wasn't a thing for most peoples until very recently). Since it would benefit their prestige many aristocratic families would claim descent from gods, demi-gods and heroes, so even more and more female partners were added to their sexual biographies in order to suit the narratives of nobility. Off the top of my head I can list maybe more than 5 women for Zeus, Poseidon, Helios, Apolo, Hermes, Dionysus, Ares, Heracles, Theseus, Odysseus, etc. For the goddesses, nymphs and mortal women, I barely can name more than 2 male partners and most times at least one of them was through rape. The only exception I can think of, would be Aphrodite who bore many children from different fathers. You go gurl!\n\nSome examples of \"studs\" in modern fiction and their romantic/sexual interests:\u00b7 Robert E. Howard's **Conan**: >!B\u00ealit, Yasmina, Valeria, Zenobia, etc.!<\u00b7 Michael Moorcock's **Elric**: >!Cymoril, Oone, Shaarilla, Yishana, Zarozinia, (the Rose?, etc.!<\u00b7 Andrzej Sapkowski's **Geralt:** >!Yenneffer, Triss, Shani, Essi Daven, Iola, Renfri, Fringilla, Coral, etc.!<\n\nI'm sure there are many, many more, but those three just came to mind without even trying.\n\nThe only example of fantasy fiction *by women* in which the female protagonist has multiple sexual and romantic partners throughout the story is >!Madeline Miller's \"Circe\", !<and her romantic interactions are 100% relevant to her development as a character, since it's a highly intimate novel with a character driven plot.\n\nDo my fellow redditors have any recommendations for books with female protagonists that have an active romantic and sexual life, preferably written by women? Don't care if the partners are males, females or non-conforming.\n\n**TL; DR: A surprising amount of female characters wanna get with the heroes in fantasy written by men. Any examples of female protagonists with an active sexual and romantic life written by women?**  \n\n\n**PS: Please refrain from posting insensitive, sexist or misogynistic comments in the replies. Please be respectful and empathetic. Thanks in advance!**"

[When we last checked in](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/hrneka/climbing_mount_readmore_reading_our_top_fantasy/), I nearly finished 34-30. Now we go from 30 to 26:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**30. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke (24 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Magic is returning to England. With the stuffy Mr. Norrell preaching the virtues of academic magic and the boisterous, improvisational Jonathan Strange taking an opposite approach, London has never felt more lively as the two bicker over the proper ways to reintroduce magic to the country. But there is a mysterious foe, a fairy known as the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair who lurks menacingly behind the scenes and works to undo all that these two magicians hope to achieve.\n\nThe great thing about this book is, first and foremost, the extremely well realized characters. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are just fully fleshed out, memorable characters from the instant the appear in the book that they practically leap off the page. Even less three dimensional characters such as the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair are appropriately menacing and memorable in their roles. But the thing that makes the characters pop off of each other is how they conflict with each other in their various understandings of magic. See, JS&MN is a book about magic and is thematically very interested in exploring the differing approaches of its two leads: the systematic and practically scientific approach of Norrell versus the freewheeling and innovative anything goes approach of Strange. Yes, that's right, this book as about hard magic versus soft magic. What's remarkable is that, without ever picking a side, Clarke manages to portray both systems at their best and shows what they can do when they work in tandem while acknowledging a bit of natural animosity between the two schools of thought. Maybe this makes the book a bit too insular for readers from outside the fantasy genre but for anyone who has ever gotten stuck in a \"hard magic or soft magic?\" debate, it is wonderful to read a story that shows them as respectable equals that have their own strengths and weaknesses. And lastly, there is some marvelous humor in here if you happen to know your early 19th century British history. Clarke peppers in a lot of subtle jabs at trends and opinions of the times that are extremely gratifying to see if you know where to look. I'm not totally sure the historical setting is needed outright but those jokes go a long way to justifying them even if this story could be set at almost any time period in Britain as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThere is one very serious flaw here and that is that the first quarter of the book is tediously boring. But wait, how can I call this a great book and one of my favorites if I think close to 250 pages of it are a chore to read? A great question. I think the book largely makes up for the lengthy stumbling intro but I can't really blame anyone who couldn't power through the nearly novel length chunk of time where little happens. Some defend this beginning part by saying it makes sense that the section largely from stodgy Mr. Norrell's POV is dull but while it makes sense, I think it's a profoundly bad idea for any author to consciously make such a large sequence dull because it matches the character. It's okay to write about dull things in fun and interesting ways, it's preferred even! The best kind of writing is the kind that takes the dull and makes it interesting, not the kind that takes the dull and double checks to make sure it stays dull out of a misguided sense of tonal cohesion. Isn't half the fun of the movie Office Space that they managed to make a hilarious comedy out of the drudgery of meaningless office work? No one would want to watch Office Space if it decided to be as boring as actually working in an office was. And I wish Clarke had livened up this beginning because it does turn off many people who I believe would love the book if they could make it farther in.\n\nAll this is to say that I think JS&MN is a masterpiece. Highly flawed in some ways but still exceptional in enough other ways to make it a justified classic in my view. If you can soldier through the weak opening, you'll find a novel that opens up in countless interesting ways that's full of magic and charm that's hard to resist.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** A cat-squasher of a book with humor, memorable characters, and a lot to say about magic.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** Yes, this really feels like a world ripe for more exploration.\n\n**28.** **~~The Last Wish~~** **Blood of Elves by Andrzej Sapkowski, Book 3 of The Witcher (37 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Geralt of Rivia is sworn to protect Ciri, granddaughter of the King of Cintra, and a child of great power who is being targeted for assassination by an unknown foe.\n\n**ETA:** I initially had the wrong title written down here. A user correctly pointed out that I sounded like I had actually read Blood of Elves, not The Last Wish and sure enough, that's what I had read. Whoops.\n\nA common refrain among reviewers who come away from a book disappointed is \"I wanted to like this.\" It's kind of a silly thing to say because yeah, of course you did. Normal people don't actively wish to have a bad reading experience. The closest you get to that feelings is resignation because you don't expect to like something but even then that's more trepidation than hope. Which brings me to my feelings on the Witcher. I don't get the Witcher. Don't really care for the games, don't care for the tv show, and every description I've heard of the books makes them sound bland. A super powerful guy goes around killing monsters, sleeping with a ton of women, and has magical powers that require him to be completely emotionless? It sounds like all the least interesting aspects of power fantasy rolled into one and having an emotionless protagonist is almost always boring barring rare exceptions like when such a character is acted by Leonard Nimoy. So, in approaching this book, I was pretty worried I would not like this at all.\n\nLuckily, it turned out better than I expected. The novel has a really incredible sense for naturalistic pacing where everything seems to happen at the right time without feeling force or too quick or too slow. The prose is also lean and something else while still making room for some striking imagery where it can. The world, while a bit derivative with all the classic fantasy creatures, also feels somewhat fresh and filled with possibilities. Sapkowski manages to inject just enough novelty in his world to make it feel newer and more original than I think it would sound on paper. I also think there's a lot of interesting political and religious worldbuilding even if those elements are often relegated to the background. I would sometimes find myself pausing to mull over some of these little tidbits of information like the fascinating reveal in one chapter that wizards are mostly infertile and those that aren't are often forced to infertility by other jealous wizards. It's an interesting detail that implies a ton of character to the world and showcases an all too believable pettiness in these powerful masters that I found captivating.\n\nHowever, Geralt is exactly as boring as I was worried about and his boring nature is made all the worse by the fact that I'm not sure there's a single character in here who doesn't talk about how great Geralt is. Ciri's firs remark about Geralt is that he can make her believe things when no one else can, the bard Dandilion's first scene is of him singing Geralt's praises quite literally, Triss Merigold's first scene has her fantasizing about getting to sleep with Geralt. It just goes on and on, meanwhile Geralt's only actions for the first hundred and some pages of the book is to tell Ciri that bad dreams aren't worth worrying about. This is pretty disappointing example of how showing over telling can hamper a good premise. It would be far more compelling to see Geralt performing heroics and let us readers decide how awesome he is rather than have and endless string of side characters talk him up at length while he twiddles his thumbs. This also kind of leads into the problem that the plot feels unfocused. I can't tell how much of this is due to the non-linear storytelling of the novel (which I admire the ambition of but I am unclear on what it added to the actual plot. It kind of seemed like a gimmick rather than a necessary element) but very few of the threads in the story appeared to link back up and little changed from what I think the beginning of the story was to what the end of the story was. The book began with Ciri potentially having great powers and getting training for them while being the target of a nebulous plot to harm her and the book ended with all of that remaining the same and no information as to why Ciri was targeted being revealed. No relationships really changed during the book either except for Ciri's relationship to Yenneffer but their whole relationship began and concluded in the last chapter of the book, so I can't really call that a satisfying development.\n\nIt's certainly not a bad book and there are good elements here. Even the things I wasn't quite on board with (like the non-linear story) were at least motivated by a desire to tell an unconventional story which makes me want to cut this book more slack when compared to other books on this list that have failed for laziness but I can't say I have any desire to continue on with a main character this boring and a writing style this focused on telling over showing. I think this could be laying the groundwork for a more interesting story given how marvelous the worldbuilding seemed to be but I am also deeply disinterested in the main character so I'm not sure an interesting world is enough to compel me to read the next entry. I can see why it appeals to some but it ultimately just wasn't for me.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** It's an ambitious work that hints at a spectacular world to unfold in later stories. The real reason it's on the list though is because the video games are popular.\n* **Would you continue on?** Probably not.\n\n**28. The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison (same position on the 2019 list)**\n\n>Maia has lived his whole life as an estranged outcast until his father's death when he is ushered to the capital and crowned as the next emperor. Through an unfamiliar political terrain, assassination attempts, and his own scarred past, Maia must find a way to become a better ruler than even he believes he is capable of being.\n\nAs this is a slice of life novel, there is less focus on a conventional plot and more focus on the development of the main character as Maia works through his emotional struggles with ruling and tries to acclimate to the capital. I've seen a number of people get frustrated with this softer plot focus but I personally feel it works well for the type of story being told. Maia is a cinnamon roll of a character who just wants to do well and for everyone to get along and who is so unprepared for what he is getting into but still manages to win over a few crucial allies through his unassuming nature and pure lack of guile. Thematically, the story is most interested in the importance of emotional connection which in some ways makes it a bit of an anti-conflict book as the resolutions to most situations in the book come not from battles or fights but from small acts of kindness or generosity. In fact, the biggest emotional touchstone of the novel is arguably Maia forgiving someone who had hurt him when he was younger where most other fantasy books would have their emotional climax at a battle or with two characters falling in love. The lower key approach and emphasis on community and empathy makes the book spectacular comfort reading.\n\nThe obvious weakness here is that the slice of life approach can leave the book feeling meandering and plotless to people who prioritize action over character. I personally think Addison manages to sprinkle in more than enough action to keep even those of us with weaker tolerances for slice of life reading interested but I'm sure that's not a universal truth. I've also heard the complaint that the names in this book are hard to remember and the counterargument that the names are purposefully hard to simulate the experience Maia is going through of being in over his head in a foreign land. Personally, neither argument really resonates with me as someone who has always been terrible with names. These names didn't seem noticeably harder than usual fantasy names to me and I of course completely forgot all of them anyway. All I can say is that while I was reading it was pretty easy for me to go \"oh yeah, that guy!\" so I'm not sure it really added the layer of challenge that others have said it does but it's a common complaint so I figured it was worth listing here. There's probably also an argument to be made that it's politically naive to have a story where all it takes to solve deeply entrenched political problems is kindness and empathy but honestly, I think the genre could use a little more of this kind of wish fulfillment and a little less traditional power fantasy so I can't hold this bit against the book.\n\nThis is one that I personally think is great but it is so different from the types of books that usually get popular on this sub that I'm not totally sure how a new reader would feel coming to it. It's absolutely worth reading but I think it's important to be prepared for it to be a very different kind of reading experience than epic fantasy fans are used to.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** An uplifting book about the power of dedicating yourself to your task and building camaraderie.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** Yes and I think this story lends itself well towards easy sequelizing. You don't even have to stick with the current ruler, just random stories about managing the bureaucracy of this unique world would be enough.\n\n**26. Lions of al-Rassan by Guy Gavriel Kay (42 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>On a peninsula divided in a religious war between Jaddites and Asharites, the future of the land will be shaped by three people. Rodrigo Belmonte, ferocious commander of Jaddite forces, Ammar ibn Khairan, poet and regicide, and Jehane, doctor and member of the Kindath minority that is persecuted by both sides. The unlikely friendship between these three will shape events to come as the inevitably must choose sides in the fight between al-Rassan and Esperana.\n\nThis is probably GGK's best book. I have to admit I'm far less certain after having read Sailing to Sarantium though I can't be certain until I get a free moment to check out Lord of Emperors, but this is the standalone that works best. Thematically, the novel explores the time period known in our world as the Reconquista, when Spain fought against Muslim conquerers to reclaim the Iberian peninsula over a period of hundreds of years. GGK condenses this period down to about 20 years and only portrays two of those 20 in this book for the sake of keeping the work standalone. His primary concern is exploring the cyclical religious violence as each side uses the other side's previous atrocities as justification for committing further atrocities and in sympathizing with the Kindath (an analogue of Jewish people) that are caught in between and despised by both sides. In spite of those enmities. most of the book is spent developing the friendships of representatives from each of the major religions of the region and each of them is fairly well developed. Jehane and ibn Khairan are probably the most complex characters as Belmonte is a little too morally pure for the type of story being told (though from what I gather this does seem to be fairly close to how the person his character was based on behaved) but he is still a likable character and it is nice to see a character who treats all of the people of the region well. Naturally, when you've got three religious groups that can't get along, the story isn't going to have a perfectly happy conclusion though GGK does manage an interesting threading of the needle where the ending feels far more optimistic and happier than it could have wound up.\n\nThere aren't a lot of complaints I have here. The biggest is just that I think ibn Khairan and Belmonte's relationship isn't as well developed as it needs to be for this story to truly shine. They share remarkably little screen time and rarely converse with each other though characters repeatedly state that they clearly respect each other greatly. Jehand, as the woman caught between them, is often used a proxy for their relationship with her intense feelings for both of them being used as something of a substitute for showing a deeper relationship between the two male leads. We care that these men might wind up as enemies who will have to kill each other because Jehane cares about them and doesn't want to lose either of them but neither of them has spent enough time with the other in the book for an organic feeling, convincing relationship to form. And yes, this does technically count as something of a love triangle so I assume there are readers who will be turned off from the novel solely for that reason.\n\nSo if you're a fan of historical fantasy, tragedy, and think you might like the works of GGK, this is probably the best place to start with his books.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** It's a wonderfully tragic tale about conflicting loyalties and religious extremism.\n* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** I'm not sure where the characters could go from here but yes.\n\n**26. The Black Company by Glen Cook, Book 1 of the Chronicles of the Black Company (30 on the 2019 list)**\n\n>The Lady has risen from her tomb and seeks to conquer the world. To that end, she has hired the mercenary group known as the Black Company to serve her needs. As the company handles the darkest work and helps the Lady as she crushes the rebellion that seeks to stop her, the company's historian, Croaker, grows ever more enamored with service to this dark ruler even as he fears for his and his friends' lives under her rule. Can the Black Company survive service to one of the greatest evils that ever walked the earth?\n\nThere are so few things like the Black Company in epic fantasy, even among the books that drew inspiration from Black Company, that it's easy to get hyperbolic with praise quickly. From it's effortless sense of scope and scale, to the morally gray but still easy to like characters, and the unique worldbuilding that somehow does in 200 pages what most fantasy authors think they're doing in 600, it's just an impressive work all around. Croaker and his strange relationship to the dictatorial Lady is fascinating to follow along with as he struggles between his interest in her and his disgust with both her actions and himself for being in her employ. The use of magic in this world is also something I appreciate in that it seems to ever only come in flavors of great and terrible from the way the Lady can literally steal her enemy's souls and convert them to her cause to the way the Taken that she creates can use the magic carpet they have on hand to produce seriously devastating aerial bombardments. Cook is also very skilled at tone, being able to move fairly effortlessly between the kind of gallows humor that soldiers are sometimes known for, the creepiness and horror of the scenes with the Taken, and the more lighthearted moments when the Company gets time off to themselves and try to forget the part they're playing in destroying the freedom fighters who oppose the Lady.\n\nThe downsides of Black Company are effectively inverses of what makes it so good. 200 pages is too short for some people to get sucked in, it leaves very little room for meaningful character development so if you don't like the characters at the beginning all the much, they won't be changing too significantly. I've also heard the opinion that epic fantasy doesn't truly feel epic if it doesn't take up enough page and while I don't think Black Company quite falls into this failing, I can definitely see how a trilogy that's shorter in total than many single entries of other epic fantasy works might not feel suitably epic.\n\nThis review turned out a lot shorter than I expected but I guess it fits for the subject matter. Black Company is well worth a read and with such a short length, even if you don't like the story you at least won't have much of your time wasted.\n\n* **Why is this a top novel?** A truly unique epic fantasy with plenty of action and adventure.\n* **Would you continue on?** In a heartbeat.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd that's it for this month!

        "body": "light spoilers for the start of Time of Contempt and vague spoilers for Ninth House below\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I finished these two books in September now, a million years ago, and they've started to fade from my mind, but one thing from each book stood out to me (well, 2 things from the Witcher if you count how painfully obvious it was that the mage dinner party scene was written by a man). in Time of Contempt, the first major encounter takes place not with a dragon, or a king, or some fated mage from legends. it's not even a military thing, he goes to a lawyer of all places. Having these normal, almost boring things in fantasy, to me, fleshes out the world more so than any long-winded explanations of the governmental system or city description. when Dungeons and Dragons conditions us to see every barkeep as a princess in exile and every person over the age of 50 secretly either a wizard or a god, it almost comes as a shock to have a lawyer of all people in a fantasy setting. it's just a neat little tidbit that also serves to show that this society is advanced enough to have people who's sole job is to argue the law, and that the law is complex enough to be argued. also, the conversation about the benefits and drawbacks of whistling nada stars was unintentionally hilarious for reasons I can't quite explain. I like this series, but I've come to realise I only really like it for the bounty hunter going around his life while the big plot stuff happens in the background, so I think I'll take my leave here. I'll still watch the show, until Netflix invariably cancels it after the second season (fuck you, netflix) but as the series goes off towards more grand and adventurous stakes, I'll keep rooting around for something to fill that gap. I hear that Drizzt chap is pretty cool.\n\nI also, in the same timeframe, read Ninth House. for some reason Leigh Bardugo's writing style just doesn't click with me (an issue I have with a lot of writers, of no fault of mine or theirs) which lead to a lot of zoning in and out of scenes, but my dead favourite part of the book was the magic. magic clearly exists, but for some reason or another (which I don't think is ever explained, ninth house isn't the book to give you lore on the nature of magic and thousand-year-old sorcerers) nobody can actually properly use magic in the traditional sense, no shooting fireballs from your hands, (I don't count ritualistic magic and stuff in that circle because I'm weird like that). the idea that magic can only be used through trinkets like coins, is a really interesting one, and I'd love to see it fleshed out to its maximum potential, even beyond what this book does. the story is also pretty good, I'm sure the twist at the end is mind-blowing to someone with even a modicum of patience, but that is not me. there were some extremely cathartic moments in it however that made me put the book down just to drink in how incredible they were. the book uses its setting to explore not just the weird ethereal magic shit, but also the reality of university life, and the power fantasy of enacting vicious and humiliating revenge on a (spoilers) >!sexual abuser!< is one I think we can all get behind\n\nIn short, both of these books were enjoyable to read, but my real gain from them was adding yet another idea to the pile of ideas for dnd games I'll likely never get to run. Ninth House finishes off my first line, a book with a number in the title, so yay me"

Also embarrassed I titled this an \u201coverhaul\u201d when I meant \u201coverview\u201d. \n\nEDIT 2: Please tell me any corrections you have or if you have any other great series I should add! I have a few more series I\u2019m adding that I didn\u2019t initially.\n\nEDIT 3: Brian McClellan was kind enough to provide exact word counts for his amazing second-trilogy Powder Mage books, *Of Gods and Powder*. Thank you sir!\n\nEDIT 4: I am bound and determined to add every series you guys mention, it will just take some time. I\u2019m going in order of mention from the comments, check back in the next few days to see if your favorite series has been added! I\u2019m still trying to fix the formatting, with limited success. I've gotten it to where it's bearable on mobile, though how to fix the eye-bleed it is on desktop I have no idea. Thank you for your patience :)\n\nEDIT 5: Now Josiah Bancroft has also provided *exact* word counts for his ground-breaking *The Books of Babel* series, thank you!\n\nEDIT 6: A huge shoutout to u/cursh14 for fixing the formatting!!! It looks a *lot* better now lol\n\nEDIT 7: Evan Winters has provided the official word count for his upcoming sequel in the Burning series, The Fires of Vengeance!! Thank you!"

        "body": "Yup. Last Saturday here, I read the last book I needed to finish my Bingo Card, and it only took me like 71 books to do it. \n\nAnyway, [here's the card](https://i.imgur.com/tTMmmvy.png), and mini-reviews will follow. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n----\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Translated** - The Kingdom of the Gods by In-Wan Youn, Eun-Hee Kim, and Kyung-Il Yang - This is the collected manga the Netflix show The Kingdom is based on. Essentially, Korean zombies. A kid and a dude travel through the country, trying to get to the palace. It's only four chapters, and I really did end up enjoying it, but it feels unfinished. The book also has Burning Hell in the same binding, which is another manga by In-Wan Youn and Kyung-Il Yang. It's set on a penal colony island where some *real* bad people get sent, what happens, and then a pirate ship shows up. It's been years since they released Phase 1, and people are still waiting for Phase 2. It's really fun, but it's definitely unfinished. \n\n * Other options: Blood of Elves and The Time of Contempt by Andrzej Sapkowski, Solaris by Stanislaw Lem\n\n* **Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold** - The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern - Does this fit? It's honestly my biggest question on the card. The scenes set >!outside the archive!< are primarily winter, IIRC, and I checked the box when I read it. So let me know if you think I should find another book. Anyway, this is one of my favorite books of the year, one of my favorites of all time. I *loved* the atmosphere Morgenstern created, the mythos, the prose, the characters. I loved the interjected stories. It's a portal fantasy about stories, endings, preservation, and magic. It's so good.\n\n * Other options: The Ice Dragon by George RR Martin, The Unspoken Name by AK Larkwood\n\n* **Optimistic** - Fireborne by Rosaria Munda - The first of a YA political thriller fantasy duology taking place shortly after the government is overthrown by revolutionaries. Essentially, they had a group monarchy (three families each functioning as 'equal' kings), the common people didn't like it and murdered everyone who didn't escape... except for one boy. The government is now attempting to be a compassionate meritocracy where they test every kid to see their potential, then sort them into jobs and societal roles based on their tests. (Plot summary, no heavy spoilers) >!Anyway, the prince was saved, then he went to an orphanage. Everyone thinks he's dead, but he tested into the top tier, and most of the book takes course over a tournament where the top-est of the top tier, the dragon riders, compete (essentially dragon-fencing) to see who will become the next ruler. Some of his escaped family reaches out to him to try and get him to help them, and he has to balance his old life with his new, making hard choices when he's forced to choose between the two.!< It's fine. YA and fantasy political thrillers only mix so well. The optimistic part? Well, that's related to the characters, to the changes to the government, and the interactions with new shortfalls. \n\n * Other options: The Souther Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix, The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow, The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson, The Bone Ships by RJ Barker, The Girl Who Drank the Moon by Kelly Barnhill, The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley, All the Stars and Teeth by Adalyn Grace, The Goblin Emperor by Katherin Addison, The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo, From a Certain Point of View edited by Elizabeth Shaefer, Crosstalk by Connie Willis, Shuri: A Black Panther Novel by Nic Stone, The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune, The Dragon Pearl by Yoon Ha Lee, Empire of Sand by Tasha Suri, The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon. Probably more, but those are the ones I marked. \n\n* **Featuring Necromancy** - Vainqueur the Dragon by Maxime J. Durand - This is a litrpg comedy novel where a long-sleeping dragon wakes up after his world is gamified and has isekai-style heroes coming from other worlds. He becomes aware of the leveling system, which is the requirement for gaining a class and levels, meaning this already-powerful dragon is about to get a lot more powerful. The dragon and the guy who told him about the leveling system (the dragon's new lackey) go through the world, completing quests and acquiring treasure. Mostly acquiring treasure. There's also a whole plot about the fae not wanting the dragon to exist, so they're the bad guys, sometimes anyway. It's good. It's funny. I liked it a lot. Oh, the >!lackey<! is the necromancer\n\n * Other options: Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir, The Unspoken Name by AK Larkwood, A Song of Wraith and Ruin by Roseanne A Brown, and this one might not *really* fit, as it's a sci-fi clone-style necromancy, but The Original by Brandon Sanderson and Mary Robinette Kowal\n\n* **Ace/Aro** - Dread Nation by Justina Ireland - Zombies rise up during/after the Battle of Gettysburg, and the repercussions from this end the Civil War to form a War Against the Dead. Black people are 'freed' from slavery, but they're conscripted into fighting the dead and given a 'wage' to make it not-slavery. Our protagonist goes to a school to learn to kill the dead and be a proper servant for white ladies, but when she crosses the wrong people, she gets herself and some friends exiled to a settlement out west, which isn't exactly a safe place and is run by some hardcore racists. This book has a ton of action, a ton of racial commentary, and it's just a ton of fun. I loved it. I do want to say I've seen some criticism over Indigenous representation in the book, but I haven't looked into that very much. I didn't read the book physically, and from what I understand, the physical edition has an author's note that has some questionable verbiage, but as I said, I haven't read that.  The >!main secondary character!< here is ace/aro. \n\n * Other options: None so far.\n\n* **Featuring a Ghost** - The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo - A novella about an anthropologist/archivist of sorts who is collecting the story of a compound where a queen used to live, gathering the story from the only person there and from the items left there. The story of the queen is really neat. She's a foreigner who became queen to bring peace, but where do her loyalties really lie? \n\n * Other options: The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix, The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, From a Certain Point of View edited by Elizabeth Schaefer, The Dragon Pearl by Yoon Ha Lee, Vainqueur the Dragon by Maxime J. Durand, Babel-17 by Samuel R. Delany, Saga by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples\n\n* **Featuring Exploration** - House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds - A lady split herself into 1000 clones, and these clones travel throughout the universe to gather knowledge and bring it back to the collective. One of the trips back to the collective has most of the members killed, and someone's trying to finish them off. They need to figure out who, why, how, and how to stop them, and there's so much universe exploration, such a big scale of time, and it's just a fantastic book. \n\n * Other options: Gideon The Ninth by Tamsyn Muir, The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow, The Bone Ships by RJ Barker, All the Stars and Teeth by Adalyn Grace, The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern, Binti: The Complete Trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor, Bad Luck Charlie by Scott Baron, The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon, The Unspoken Name by AK Larkwood\n\n* **Climate Fiction** - Shuri: A Black Panther Novel by Nic Stone - This is a really nice Middle-Grade book by Stone focusing on Shuri trying to figure out why their flower that creates the Panther powers is dying. She goes to other countries, finds out other African countries despise Wakanda for not helping out the nations struggling due to climate change. It's a decent book, one I'll be recommending to my daughters when they're of age. \n\n * Other options: Wintersong by S. Jae-Jones, The Well of Ascension and The Hero of Ages by Brandon Sanderson, The Dragon Pearl by Yoon Ha Lee, and The Ice Dragon by George R.R. Martin\n\n* **Color in the Title** - The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune - So good. This is one of my favorite novels as well, and it's just so wonderful. It's a book about a social worker who goes to check on an... unorthodox 'orphanage'. The orphanages in this world harbor magical beings, and this orphanage harbors the most 'dangerous' ones. The book is mostly about the MC dealing with democracy, forming relationships with the kids, and a slow-burn M/M romance. It's such a cozy book.\n\n * Other options: The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley, Shuri: A Black Panther Novel by Nic Stone, The Ballad of Black Tom by Victor LaValle, The Priory of the Orange Treey by Samantha Shannon, and The Black God's Drum by P. Djeli Clark\n\n* **Any r/rfantasy Book Clube or Read Along** - The Bone Ships by RJ Barker - This is essentially a fantasy whaling novel with sea-dragons. Yeah. It captures the nautical feel perfectly, and I'm so excited to read the sequel.\n\n * Other options: The Ten Thaousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow, The Blue Sword Robin McKinley, Hero Forged by Josh Erickson, All the Stars and Teeth by Adalyn Grace, The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo, The Unspoken Name by AK Larkwood, Crosstalk by Connie Willis, A Song of Wraiths and Ruin by Roseanne A Brown, Queen of the Conquered by Kacen Callender, The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern, King's Dragon by Kate Elliott, Empire of Sand by Tasha Suri, The Haunting of Tram Car 015 by P Djeli Clark, and Prince of Dogs by Kate Elliott\n\n* **Self-Published** - Bad Luck Charlie Scott Baron - This was a crazy book. Uber-fast-paced and a lot off the wall. An engineer gets kinda roped into going to pace, they fall through wormhole, and they end up in a galaxy where technology doesn't exist because magic does. (Plot outline, heavy spoilers) >!The guy ends up enslaved, then a pirate, then an almost-gladiator, then enslaved, then dragon-food, then a gladiator, then a bodyguard maybe?!< It's a hoot, though.\n\n * Other options: Hero Forged by Josh Erickson, Vainqueur the Dragon by Maxime J. Durand\n\n* **Chapter Epigraphs** - The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson - This is the first in the Mistborn trilogy, and it has the prettiest cover. I think one of the SA books will take this space, but whatever. This is a book about a group of cons/thieves attempting to overthrow an immortal emperor. It features people who gain magic powers by eating metal and focuses on a teen girl. I really liked it, but I'm easy to please. I can see how some people feel this is a little formulaic or sanitized or something, but it really had me by the heart. I read the trilogy in like 10 days total. \n\n * Other options - The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages, and The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, Hero Forged by Josh Erickson, The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo, Crosstalk by Connie Willis, Blood of Elves and The Time of Contempt by Andrzej Sapkowski, Dread Nation by Justina Ireland\n\n* **Published in 2020** - All the Stars and Teeth by Adalyn Grace - I didn't particularly like this book. It's filled with overdone YA tropes, the forefront of them is poor communication. It reads strongly like a YA book. The magic is really neat, though, and plot revelations make it even better. It also feels like a debut, though. \n\n * Other options: The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins, The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo, The Unspoken Name by AK Larkwood, Shuri: A Black Panter Novel by Nic Stone, A Song of Wraiths and Ruin by Roseanne A. Brown, The Book of Dragons edited by Jonathan Strahan, The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune, The Original by BRandon Sanderson and Mary Robinette Kowal, and Riot Baby by Tochi Onyebuchi\n\n* **Set in a School or University** - The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins - So, this is a bit of a controversial book. It's the youth of President Snow, and it's not really his descent to evil-ness that people wanted. It's much more just showing him as a human, and I loved it. People tend to not be a fan of the >!romance arc, saying it's pointless, but I'd say the arc isn't a romance arc. It just shows how Snow sees literally everything and everyone as his possessions to please him in the moment or be discarded!<. So yeah, lots of people don't like it. For me? I really, really enjoyed the questions Collins brought to the forefront. Anyway, a large part of the book is set in the Capitol's academy, teaching people to become respected members of society. \n\n * Other options: The Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter, The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern, Fireborn by Rosaria Munda, Binti: The Complete Trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor, Dread Nation by Justina Ireland\n\n* **Book About Books** - The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix - This book is nuts. 90s stay-at-home souther suburban moms involved in a book club end up plagued by a very nice (until he's not) vampire. Hendrix really creates a suburban feel in the book, and of course, whether or not the guy's a vampire is a major topic. There's a lot going on for a sleepy suburb. \n\n * Other options: The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow, Solaris by Stanislaw Lem, The Power by Naomi Alderman, The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern, King's Dragon by Kate Elliott, The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, The Prince of Dogs by Kate Elliott, The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson\n\n* **Made You Laugh** - Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir - So, this is an irreverent book about space necromancers and their lifesworn bodyguards playing a game of Clue while also trying to find the oldest, most guarded secret of their universe which would make them uber-powerful and functionally immortal. Its sense of humor is very internet-focused, imo, so if you're not big on meme humor or referential humor, you probably won't laugh for this one. \n\n * Other options: The Girl Who Drank the Moon by Kelly Barnhill, Hero Forged by Josh Erickson, From a Certain Point of View by Elizabeth Shcaefer, The Kingdom of the Gods by In-Wan Youn, Crosstalk by Connie Willis, A Scanner Darkly by Philip K. Dick, The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern, The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune, Vainqueur the Dragon my Maxime J Durand, Babel-17 by Samuel R. Delany, Saga by Brian K Vaughan & Fiona Staples, Bad Luck Charlie by Scott Baron\n\n* **Five Short Stories** - The Book of Dragons edited by Jonathan Strahan - First off, I'm only considering collections for this one. I've read quite a few short stories outside of collections, but I'm not going to list all of them. Second, this anthology is fantastic. It's all about dragons, and there're some incredible pieces of writing tucked in here. So good, so good. Even the poetry is good.\n\n * Other options: The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu, From a Certain Point of View by Elizabeth Schaefer\n\n* **Big Dumb Object** - Solaris by Stanislaw Lem - There's a sentient ocean on a planet, and humanity wants to study it. They get out there, and suddenly, all the crew finds real, physical memories. People from their past who are no longer with them are suddenly on the station. Why is this happening, what is the nature of humanity, other big sci-fi questions fill the pages. It's a solid book. Read the most recent translation, though.\n\n * Other options: The Well of Ascension and The Hero of Ages by Brandon Sanderson, Shuri: A Black Panther Novel by Nic Stone, The Power by Naomi Alderman, Babel-17 by Samuel R. Delany\n\n* **Feminist** - ~~King's Dragon by Kate Elliott - This is the first of the Crown of Stars series by Elliott. It's a religion and politics heavy fantasy that follows a cast of characters as the country fights off foreign, inhuman invaders and tries not to devolve into internal chaos. The religion is heavily based on Catholicism, but if there were two gods, one a woman and one a man. I really ended up liking it, enough to where I'm in the readalong for the whole series.~~\n\n * Let's try this again. - Binti: The Complete Trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor - I misremembered what Hard Mode was for this square, so I've changed it to the Binti Trilogy. I read these separately and not in the bindup, but they were solid. The first book was mediocre, in my opinion. It just didn't draw me in. That changed drastically for the second and third books. I really enjoyed those, especially the inter-species relationships and the uncovered secrets that came about. Essentially, I recommend all three because Binti I is required reading for Binti II and III, and those ones are more than worth their meager page count.\n\n * Other options: The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo, Shuri: A Black Panther Novel by Nick Stone, The Power by Naomi Alderman, Empire of Sand by Tasha Suri, The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon, Fireborne by Rosaria Munda, ~~Binti: The Complete Trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor~~, Prince of Dogs by Kate Elliott\n\n* **Canadian Author** - The Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter - I really enjoyed this one. It's a revenge story about the injustice in hierarchical-by-birth systems while mostly being a training story. Training, and training, and training. They're a very militaristic society, set on defending against another group of individuals and using magic to do so. Our protagonist >!exploits that magic to get much, much better, at the cost of his own sanity, or at least parts of it!< and it's a wonderful first novel in a series that doesn't feel like straight set-up.\n\n * Other options: None yet\n\n* **Number in the Title** - The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow - This is the third of my top three books so far this Bingo. It's about a girl who figures out doors go places. Not like 'to the living room' places but places where legends and myths come from. Special doors go to all kinds of different worlds. It's a tale of lost lovers trying to find each other, of split families looking to be made whole, and of power-hungry old men who want to control everything and destroy what they can't.\n\n * Other options: Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir, The Haunting of Tram Car 015 by P. Djeli Clark\n\n* **Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance** - Empire of Sand by Tasha Suri - This is a book based on Indian mythology, from what I understand, and it's quite fun. You've got magic in the blood, unbreakable oaths, dance magic, a slow-burn romance that starts with a marriage, and more. The romance is really sweet. \n\n * Other options: The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harros, Recursion by Black Crouch, This Is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, The Blue Sword by Robin McKInley, Hero Forged by Josh Erickson, All the Stars and Teeth by Adalyn Grace, The Unspoken Name by AK Larkwood, Crosstalk by Connie Willis, A Song of Wraiths and Ruin by Roseanne A. Brown, The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern, The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune, Babel-17 by Samuel R Delany, The Priory of the Orange Tree\n\n* **Magical Pet** - The Girl Who Drank the Moon by Kelly Barnhill - This is a story about a young girl who was meant to be sacrificed in the woods. She was saved by a witch and accidentally given too much magic, so she's made to forget it for a time. The time comes where she needs her magic, where the bad lady is back and in the open, and she remembers. Her and her talking dragon pet/friend will have to save the day. It's a lovely Middle-Grade book that's all kinds of adorable. \n\n * Other options: The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo, Coraline by Neil Gaiman, King's Dragon and Prince of Dogs by Kate Elliott, Saga by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples, Dragon Wing by Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman\n\n* **Graphic Novel / Audiobook** - The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon - I listened to this one, and I really enjoyed the book. It has some pacing issues, but there is so much right going on. It probably would have been better as a trilogy or duology with more clearly defined breaks, but there's a lot of fun here, a lot of dragons, and some **big** stakes. \n\n * Other options: I'm only putting hard mode audiobooks here. The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages, and The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, Saga by Brian K Vaughan & Fiona Staples, The Kingdom of the Gods by In-Wan Youn, Eun-Hee Kim, and Kyung-Il Yang\n\n* **Featuring Politics** - The Unspoken Name by AK Larkwood - This book didn't really make a huge impression on me. I remember reading it, remember where I was when I read certain bits, etc, but while other books on this list just *stuck* with me, this one hasn't. I know there's a good amount of the book dedicated to putting someone in charge of a city. Besides that, the book felt disjointed, and time has only exacerbated that feeling. There's a time where everyone's in a cold place. A time where they're in a city. A time where they're somewhere else. All in all, it was meh for me, although a lot of people like it. Maybe I'll give it another shot some day. \n\n * Other options: The Final Empire, The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages, and The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, The Gobline Emperor by Katherine Addison, The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo, Blood of Elves and The Time of Conetempt by Andrezej Sapkowski, King's Dragon and Prince of Dogs by Kate Elliott, Animal Farm by George Orwell, Shuri: A Black Panther Novel by Nic Stone, The Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter, The Power by Naomi Alderman, A Song of Wriaths and Ruin by Roseanne A Brown, Queen of the Conquered by Kacen Callender, The Haunting of Tram Car 015 by P. Djeli Clark, Vainqueur the Dragon by Maxime J Durand, Saga by Brian K Vaughan & Fiona Staples, The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon, Fireborne by Rosaria Munda, Binti: The Complete Trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor\n\n----\n\nThere we go. That's all of the squares, where all the books fit, etc. Mini-reviews. I can swap some stuff around, and I'm sure I will before I submit it. There's a good chance I swap one of The Witcher books for the Manga in the translated square, although I'm still hoping to read a translated book by a woman author before March, along with hard mode for the handful of other squares which aren't yet. I know I have books that fit for each square, but I've prioritized hard modes and pretty colors, so there may be some things that need to be switched for best-fit reasons too, I suppose. \n\nI'm also not really done-done. I have nine books left for my BLM Bingo Card (and I'm 80% done with the one I'm on), then the Crown of Stars and Stormlight Archive Read-a-longs (which I guess won't benefit my Bingo card at this point), and I've got a lot of sequels to read before the end of the year (which again I guess doesn't change my card much). I also think I nearly had a second card before I read a book that fir the Ace/Aro square, so I might just have another Ace/Aro square book and another Canadian Author square book to read before I have a second card, although that may require using the same author on multiple cards. But we'll see. But I'll probably be moving squares around until the end of March. \n\nIf anyone sees any issues or has any questions, please, let me know. Also I'm fairly sure I tagged all spoilers. If I didn't, yell at me please so I do so."

        "body": "WEREWOLF: HEART OF THE FOREST is the latest visual novel from the Paradox Interactive produced World of Darkness. It is based on the old White Wolf World of Darkness where vampires, werewolves, demons, and hunters all fight a covert war behind the scenes of our modern Earth. I was never a huge Werewolf: The Apocalypse fan like I was Vampire: The Masquerade or Changeling: The Dreaming but I did run a few campaigns of it. Honestly, I was always more of a Fera fan than the Garou Nation. You can guess this by the fact that I wrote I was a Teenage Weredeer.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with W:TA, basically it has the idea that werewolves are the warriors of Gaia. The spirit of the Earth has granted them the power to shapeshift in order to stop those destroying the world. Garou history is a never-ending war against monsters created by the spirit of entropy, the Wyrm, and the spirit of order, called the Weaver. The Garou, unfortunately, failed in their duty by being a mixture of violent jerks as well as selfish marauders. It doesn't help that claws and teeth are not great weapons against Enron versus spreadsheets and journalism.\n\nThe premise is that Maia is a Polish American college student who has decided to journey to the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest along the Belarus/Polish border in order to investigate her family heritage. It is one of the last remaining primeval forests in the world and a real life natural wonder. So, obviously, people want to cut it all down. Maia is having dreams of the forest speaking to her and these include many cryptic clues to the idea that more is going on than a controversial logging project. It's not much of a spoiler to reveal that, yes, Maia is a werewolf about to go through her first change.\n\nHonestly, Heart of the Forest is unlike any other werewolf game that I've played (tabletop or otherwise) as it goes out of its way to offer alternatives to violence. The opportunity for Maia to give into her rage and go on a killing spree is ever present but it felt wrong for her character. I was compelled to always try to seek peaceful solutions, defy my rage, and work toward mutual understanding. Understandably, I ended up becoming a Ragabash Child of Gaia but came within inches of being a Philodox instead. For those unfamiliar with W:TA that means that I'm a funny clever peaceful wolf rather than a grr-argh meanie wolf.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with W:TA that means that I'm a funny clever peaceful wolf rather than a grr-argh meanie wolf. The game is still recognizably Werewolf: The Apocalypse but the violence is presented as far less justified and possibly counter-productive to the idea of saving the planet. There is no Pentex, or if it's there then it is far from the armies of Formori and Black Spiral Dancer-filled First Teams, and everyone around you is either a normal human being or a Garou. This makes the very interesting dichotomy of you being a terrifying barbarian warrior among ordinary people just trying to live their lives.\n\nPart of this may be the changing nature of the times. When W:TA first came out in 1992, environmental issues were certainly becoming pressing but the sense of urgency brought about by global warming wasn't the same level it is now. Also, protests being sabotaged by outside actors or slandered as violent wasn't quite as well known a tactic as today. When one of the werewolves thinks they should just kill every one of the loggers and sabotage their equipment, the mature modern player is likely to have a very different reaction today than perhaps when they were a teenage edgelord in the Nineties. Or maybe that's just me.\n\nIndeed, the more nuanced approach to violence may put off some W:TA fans due to the fact that it gives a rather nasty portrayal of the Get of Fenris. Multiple Garou tribes are represented in the game but the Get of Fenris are dismissed as werewolf fascists. Much is made of the fact that they fought on the side of the Russians and Nazis during WW2 as well (albeit Maia's grandfather is a former Polish freedom fighter Get). You have no opportunity to join them and every werewolf you speak to talks about the Get with a mixture of contempt and disgust.\n\nThis makes me wonder about the future of the Get because they've always been a group that has struggled against bad-faith actor fans. In 2003, I had a conversation with a developer of W:TA, who admitted that they had a Neo-Nazi problem in the fandom. Despite being a pro-indingeneous, pro-racial harmony, punkish game, there were plenty of white supremacists who loved the game and almost purely played the hyper-masculine Viking-esque Get. It even led to the Swords of Heimdall, a in-universe villain faction, being executed because they were an explicitly white supremacist group.\n\nThis is a tremendous game and I encourage everyone who enjoys the WOD to try out this visual novel. The story is a bit on the short side and I feel like we were only getting into Maia's story when it abruptly came to an end. I also feel like it perhaps worked a little hard on establishing its human characters since Anya and Bartrek felt more \"real\" than the actual werewolves. Still, I appreciated what seems to be a preview of W5 and if this is going to be the \"new\" W:TA then it seems like it is in good hands."

I seen a lot of places to set the difficulty to death March so you can enjoy the game and its fullest using potions mutagens and all that stuff,and while I enjoy this more a little bit it gets a little bit too much after meeting yennefer and going to the castle on the next zone I seem to get my butt kicked really badly.\n\nI was wondering if it was worth it to just turn the difficulty down to normal on play the game that way, well I want the full experience and challenge of the monsters used to having to use the potions and everything else, I would like to actually be able to progress the game without getting just destroyed.\n\nso is normal worth it I would also kind of like a platinum the game at some point or at least try to as I am never Platinum a game before."

And, that the reason we're getting so few of those was because they over-saturated the market in-between the fifth and sixth generations of consoles, because Final Fantasy VII made them huge to the point of running the genre into the ground and getting it replaced with military shooters by the seventh and eighth generations of consoles.  Right?\n\nYeah, a lot of people... actually didn't really forget, so much as remember fondly that The Witcher trilogy arrived in-between 2007 and 2015, and proved to everyone that medieval fantasy wasn't dead or being replaced with Call of Duty/Halo/Gears of War-style military science fiction.  Like, to me, the best part about The Witcher trilogy and its card game spin-off, Gwent, were the wide range of opposing factions that further reinforced Geralt's neutrality and thus the moral choices of the series, including the Northern Kingdoms, Nilfgaard, the Scoia'tael, Skellige, and Novigrad's Syndicate.  As in, Geralt doesn't gather party-members, yet doesn't need to at all when he surrounds himself with so many of these factions and their diverse, colorful, and complex casts of characters that would have made him look even more like a small, insignificant speck in his own ongoing trilogy than he was already intended to be.\n\nSo here's to The Witcher trilogy and Gwent proving to everyone that medieval fantasy is not dead, alongside Game of Thrones!  And here's hoping that even more medieval fantasy RPG's like Octopath Traveler get the same recognition The Witcher trilogy and Gwent got, without having to rely on the same extravagant, expensive-looking graphics that are going to be the result of crunch, anyway."

And the reason is because The Witcher trilogy doesn't let Geralt of Rivia gather party-members for his journey, like he used to his hansa in the original books.  So instead, the closest thing I'm ever going to get to parties within that trilogy are the opposing factions who would eventually become playable decks in their own card game, Gwent, including the Northern Kingdoms, Nilfgaard, the Scoia'tael, Skellige, the Syndicate, and the very monsters Geralt of Rivia routinely gets paid to hunt and slay.  And as large-scale factions, they'd expand the overarching universe of The Witcher so much, that they'd take *the witcher himself*, and reduce him into a small, insignificant speck within said universe, which even then, was the entire point of the books and video games, anyway.\n\nAs for a better protagonist than a better universe he/she inhabits, the best I can think of, in my case, is Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII.  Barely anybody will remember that FFVII's world was taken over by Shinra Inc. and had its spiritual life energy parasited by it in-exchange for money, and that AVALANCHE was formed specifically to overthrow it in order to save the planet.  But what they *will* remember FFVII for, outside of just Sephiroth killing Aeris, is Cloud fighting against his own identity crisis and working together with his party-members, like Tifa Lockhart as one example, to resolve that identity crisis, uncover his true past, and just accept himself for who he *actually* was, flaws and everything."

Also, how does Geralt's suspension system work for his sword sheath? The one I got goes on over my shoulder and then buckles in the front but I don't know how the sheaths attach to it...thanks in advance"
