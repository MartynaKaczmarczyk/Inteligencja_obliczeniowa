        "body": "Looking for books with a female assassin with femme fatale traits—sexy, sly, mysterious, etc. She likes stealth killing, poisoning, uses fishing line garrottes and might resort to using her charms also as a weapon. \n\nDo such characters exist in Medieval fiction? Ideally, I would love a Medieval setting. Also, don’t mind fantasy, gothic or grim if it comes to that.\n\nIf not, a modern, well written femme fatale spy/ is also welcome. Someone like an adult version of a Lara Croft, Yennefer, Cersei, etc.\n\nThank you 😚",

        "title": "My thoughts after reading The Witcher series: A subversion of fantasy",
        "body": "Over the past month or so I decided to read the Witcher saga from start to finish. prior to this my only exposure to the series was from the Netflix show (which I thought was mostly ok) and a lot of my friends telling me I should play the games (which I plan on doing now that I'm finished with the books.) I came away from the series as a whole with a very different experience than the sum of its parts, and I think there's a lot to talk about. I've tried to mark any spoilers for those who haven't read it but might like to.\n\n**The Short Stories**\n\nReading the short stories in The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny almost instantly gripped me into the series and world. Each one was framed as a typical fairy tale or fable, but always managed to subvert what we should expect from those kinds of stories (admittedly this was probably more novel in 1993 than 2020). This permeates every aspect of the stories from Geralt himself to the monsters who are often victims more than terrors. \n\nGeralt is almost modeled on the archetypical ronin or western gunslinger as opposed to a typical fantasy hero. The most obvious way this is shown is the fact that he wanders from town to town picking up odd jobs that serve as a framing device for the story. However a more subtle way this manifests is the fact that Geralt is of a dying breed that is paradoxically both direly needed and seen as in the way by those in power. This is an often overlooked aspect of the Cowboy archetype: the \"wild west\" at the turn of the century was dying, and while they still had a use on the fringes of society, proper civilization with its new social structures were coming and wanted them gone. Witchers in this universe are seen the same way. They are not noble knights, but someone who can be paid money to take care of a problem that others might not even want to acknowledge. It would be very easy for Sapkowski to use this as a way to write a brooding antihero, but he subverts that subversion (which even by then had begun to become cliche) and shows that no matter how much Geralt might want to pretend that all he cares about is killing monsters for coin, he will always care about those around him.\n\nThis leads me into a running theme throughout the series, the importance of close relationships and empathy in the face of those who believe that anything/anyone can be justified for the sake of the bigger picture. This is explored a lot more in the novels, but many of the people Geralt encounters in his travel want to use him as a tool to harm innocents or carry out injustices often for no other reason than that they're in the way. Just as Witchers live mostly on the fringes of society, so do many of the monsters and other fantastical races of the world. Because of that, it becomes exceptionally easy to write off harming them or other insignificant individuals as \"for the greater good.\" The official Witcher creed is that they should always be neutral and simply carry out monster hunting contracts for money, but it's made abundantly clear by the narrative that neutrality is never really an option. When getting involved in the machinations of people who see people as disposable, the most important thing is to protect the helpless and those you care about, no matter how often Geralt wants to convince himself he's a lone wanderer with no connections to any side. This self-perception vs reality contrast is often highlighted for comedy as Geralt continues to insist he has no friends despite continually picking up a larger and larger group of (wonderful) characters who care about him and he them. It can also be used for drama as Geralt struggles with who he is as a person and whether he is able to have healthy human relationships.\n\n\n**The Novels**\n\nI had originally planned to only read the short stories because I had heard from various people that they were better than the novels. However the last short story ends on a cliffhanger for the novels themselves so I decided to read at least the first book to see what I thought. The first thing I as a reader noticed was the slower pacing. This makes sense, as writing a 300 page book is very different than writing a 50 page short story, and one could argue that it's actually a 2000 page story given that the 5 novels form one single narrative. I was prepared for that and very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book. It focused on grounded character interactions between Ciri, Geralt, and Geralt's friends. As I said before, the characters in this series are excellent so I was enjoying the \"downtime\" where things could breathe even if not too much important was happening, since that's not something you can really do with short stories. This portion of the book also set up conflicts and characters that would later become important. We later got an excellent chapter exploring the relationship between humans and the non-human races both in times of peace and times of war. However chapter 6 was the first of what I call \"exposition chapters\" of which there are a few in the series. \n\nThese exposition chapters are instances where a lot of fantasy names of people and places are thrown at the reader at once in BoE Chapter 6, the point of view switches from one group of important people sitting around a table talking about important things to another, and I hardly had any idea what anything was. Ironically, when I eventually go back and re-read the series, I'll almost certainly enjoy reading these chapters way more. The people involved and the things happening do end up being really interesting, I just had no way of knowing that at the time so it became very hard not to just kind of gloss over everything. Even a world map would have helped contextualize everything, yet the Witcher series seems to be the one fantasy series in the world that doesn't put one on the first page. The other notable exposition chapter comes two books later in Baptism of Fire when another table of important people are discussing a complex family tree full of names we've almost never heard before. One character even comments that she's confused and the writing sort of implies to the reader \"if you are then that's fine, you just need to know X is the ancestor of Y\", but if you're going to throw a complex explanation as to why this is the case, people will want to follow along. Once again visuals would go a long way in alleviating the flood of made up names to keep track of. There are only a small handful of these chapters, but they stick out a lot to a new reader and can be frustrating.\n\nThe next two books, Time of Contempt and Baptism of Fire, are where the plot actually starts and we get to see what the primary conflict of the series will be. I also think this is where some people might be tempted to drop it because at first glance it seems to have adopted a much more conventional fantasy narrative as opposed to the subversiveness that the short stories were known for. That is not to say that they're bad. The big moments are well told and character interactions are still wonderful, but suddenly you've got an evil emperor/wizard, a prophesized princess that needs saving, etc. and everything feels very typical. It's very unfortunate that people feel this way, because this is all intentional. Just as the beginnings of the short stories led the reader to believe that it would be typical fable/fairy tale only to subvert them, the set up here is just like any other fantasy story only to turn everything on its head later.\n\nSapkowski starts playing with expectations as early as Baptism of Fire, especially with Geralt's \"hanza\" of companions. >!You have a kindly, eccentric hermit that turns out to be a powerful vampire (and one of the best characters in the book.) Then there's the black-masked knight that tried to capture Ciri way back in Sword of Destiny and has been haunting her dreams since then, who in any other fantasy story would be someone Ciri must eventually face an defeat. Except here we learn that the circumstances that led him to trying to capture Ciri were almost entirely out of his control, and he devotes himself to helping Geralt rescue her. There are also smaller moments like Dandelion's \"half century of poetry\" memoirs that are built up for multiple chapters as the culmination of his life's work, only for the book to hard cut to centuries in the future where it's discovered under dirt and then burnt for kindling.!<\n\nThings get very different in the last two books, Tower of the Swallow and Lady of the Lake. Before this point Sapkowski has toyed a bit with non-linear storytelling and multiple points of view, but it kicks into overdrive here. Unfortunately I think this is another point where the series loses some readers who up until this point may have been enjoying the more conventional writing style. The writing definitely starts demanding more from the reader and it can be easy to get lost if you're not paying attention, but I think that the payoff is absolutely worth it. The way points of view from multiple times are used to inform one another is brilliant and when you learn some final piece of a mystery in \"real time\" it hits that much harder. I've seen people complain about perspectives like the trial and the historians, but I personally found them to be a great way to show how others view the protagonists of fantasy stories and how important interpretation is. At times it reminds me of Rashoman.\n\nThe way that the series finishes is, in my view, absolutely phenomenal. Everything climaxes in an extremely satisfying way on both the large scale, and more importantly, for our characters. You also realize how much the themes from the short stories carried over to the novels themselves. >!Every faction seemingly wanted to control Ciri \"for the greater good\" (Except Vilgefortz who actually was just evil) and yet we learn that the doom she was prophesized to save the world from was just global climate change that was always going to happen in a few thousand years. Everyone willing to murder to control the chosen one was deluding themselves for personal gain, and she wasn't even the chosen one. Then you have Skellen who aligned himself with corrupt and evil people because he thought the wake of death and destruction he was leaving would be worth it because there was a long shot chance that it could possibly lead to democracy generations down the road.!<  Just as with the short stories, the people who want to control and shape the world as they see fit, even if for supposedly good causes, inevitably become the source of real evil. Not monsters or chaos, but the ones who are supposedly meant to protect. It all ties back to the first short story in The Last Wish.\n\nThen there's the final chapter. >!After everything he's been through, it's tempting for Geralt simply abandon the world and retire. After all, getting involved only results in pain and it would so easy to just decide to do what he always tells himself he will: stop worrying about others and only care for himself. And that's what the plan is, until a riot breaks out in the town where he's staying and innocent people are being attacked. Geralt realizes he can't just let these people be slaughtered. He rushes to their aid and dies in the process. Not from a vicious dragon or evil wizard, but a random guy who got lucky with a pitchfork. It's tragic and yet strangely perfect.!< \n\nThere were parts of the series that at the time felt like they dragged, but once I finished I was extremely happy that I read it. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to read an atypical approach to fantasy writing.",

        "title": "My thoughts after reading The Witcher series: A subversion of fantasy",
        "body": "Over the past month or so I decided to read the Witcher saga from start to finish. prior to this my only exposure to the series was from the Netflix show (which I thought was mostly ok) and a lot of my friends telling me I should play the games (which I plan on doing now that I'm finished with the books.) I came away from the series as a whole with a very different experience than the sum of its parts, and I think there's a lot to talk about. I've tried to mark any spoilers for those who haven't read it but might like to.\n\n**The Short Stories**\n\nReading the short stories in The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny almost instantly gripped me into the series and world. Each one was framed as a typical fairy tale or fable, but always managed to subvert what we should expect from those kinds of stories (admittedly this was probably more novel in 1993 than 2020). This permeates every aspect of the stories from Geralt himself to the monsters who are often victims more than terrors. \n\nGeralt is almost modeled on the archetypical ronin or western gunslinger as opposed to a typical fantasy hero. The most obvious way this is shown is the fact that he wanders from town to town picking up odd jobs that serve as a framing device for the story. However a more subtle way this manifests is the fact that Geralt is of a dying breed that is paradoxically both direly needed and seen as in the way by those in power. This is an often overlooked aspect of the Cowboy archetype: the \"wild west\" at the turn of the century was dying, and while they still had a use on the fringes of society, proper civilization with its new social structures were coming and wanted them gone. Witchers in this universe are seen the same way. They are not noble knights, but someone who can be paid money to take care of a problem that others might not even want to acknowledge. It would be very easy for Sapkowski to use this as a way to write a brooding antihero, but he subverts that subversion (which even by then had begun to become cliche) and shows that no matter how much Geralt might want to pretend that all he cares about is killing monsters for coin, he will always care about those around him.\n\nThis leads me into a running theme throughout the series, the importance of close relationships and empathy in the face of those who believe that anything/anyone can be justified for the sake of the bigger picture. This is explored a lot more in the novels, but many of the people Geralt encounters in his travel want to use him as a tool to harm innocents or carry out injustices often for no other reason than that they're in the way. Just as Witchers live mostly on the fringes of society, so do many of the monsters and other fantastical races of the world. Because of that, it becomes exceptionally easy to write off harming them or other insignificant individuals as \"for the greater good.\" The official Witcher creed is that they should always be neutral and simply carry out monster hunting contracts for money, but it's made abundantly clear by the narrative that neutrality is never really an option. When getting involved in the machinations of people who see people as disposable, the most important thing is to protect the helpless and those you care about, no matter how often Geralt wants to convince himself he's a lone wanderer with no connections to any side. This self-perception vs reality contrast is often highlighted for comedy as Geralt continues to insist he has no friends despite continually picking up a larger and larger group of (wonderful) characters who care about him and he them. It can also be used for drama as Geralt struggles with who he is as a person and whether he is able to have healthy human relationships.\n\n\n**The Novels**\n\nI had originally planned to only read the short stories because I had heard from various people that they were better than the novels. However the last short story ends on a cliffhanger for the novels themselves so I decided to read at least the first book to see what I thought. The first thing I as a reader noticed was the slower pacing. This makes sense, as writing a 300 page book is very different than writing a 50 page short story, and one could argue that it's actually a 2000 page story given that the 5 novels form one single narrative. I was prepared for that and very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book. It focused on grounded character interactions between Ciri, Geralt, and Geralt's friends. As I said before, the characters in this series are excellent so I was enjoying the \"downtime\" where things could breathe even if not too much important was happening, since that's not something you can really do with short stories. This portion of the book also set up conflicts and characters that would later become important. We later got an excellent chapter exploring the relationship between humans and the non-human races both in times of peace and times of war. However chapter 6 was the first of what I call \"exposition chapters\" of which there are a few in the series. \n\nThese exposition chapters are instances where a lot of fantasy names of people and places are thrown at the reader at once in BoE Chapter 6, the point of view switches from one group of important people sitting around a table talking about important things to another, and I hardly had any idea what anything was. Ironically, when I eventually go back and re-read the series, I'll almost certainly enjoy reading these chapters way more. The people involved and the things happening do end up being really interesting, I just had no way of knowing that at the time so it became very hard not to just kind of gloss over everything. Even a world map would have helped contextualize everything, yet the Witcher series seems to be the one fantasy series in the world that doesn't put one on the first page. The other notable exposition chapter comes two books later in Baptism of Fire when another table of important people are discussing a complex family tree full of names we've almost never heard before. One character even comments that she's confused and the writing sort of implies to the reader \"if you are then that's fine, you just need to know X is the ancestor of Y\", but if you're going to throw a complex explanation as to why this is the case, people will want to follow along. Once again visuals would go a long way in alleviating the flood of made up names to keep track of. There are only a small handful of these chapters, but they stick out a lot to a new reader and can be frustrating.\n\nThe next two books, Time of Contempt and Baptism of Fire, are where the plot actually starts and we get to see what the primary conflict of the series will be. I also think this is where some people might be tempted to drop it because at first glance it seems to have adopted a much more conventional fantasy narrative as opposed to the subversiveness that the short stories were known for. That is not to say that they're bad. The big moments are well told and character interactions are still wonderful, but suddenly you've got an evil emperor/wizard, a prophesized princess that needs saving, etc. and everything feels very typical. It's very unfortunate that people feel this way, because this is all intentional. Just as the beginnings of the short stories led the reader to believe that it would be typical fable/fairy tale only to subvert them, the set up here is just like any other fantasy story only to turn everything on its head later.\n\nSapkowski starts playing with expectations as early as Baptism of Fire, especially with Geralt's \"hanza\" of companions. >!You have a kindly, eccentric hermit that turns out to be a powerful vampire (and one of the best characters in the book.) Then there's the black-masked knight that tried to capture Ciri way back in Sword of Destiny and has been haunting her dreams since then, who in any other fantasy story would be someone Ciri must eventually face an defeat. Except here we learn that the circumstances that led him to trying to capture Ciri were almost entirely out of his control, and he devotes himself to helping Geralt rescue her. There are also smaller moments like Dandelion's \"half century of poetry\" memoirs that are built up for multiple chapters as the culmination of his life's work, only for the book to hard cut to centuries in the future where it's discovered under dirt and then burnt for kindling.!<\n\nThings get very different in the last two books, Tower of the Swallow and Lady of the Lake. Before this point Sapkowski has toyed a bit with non-linear storytelling and multiple points of view, but it kicks into overdrive here. Unfortunately I think this is another point where the series loses some readers who up until this point may have been enjoying the more conventional writing style. The writing definitely starts demanding more from the reader and it can be easy to get lost if you're not paying attention, but I think that the payoff is absolutely worth it. The way points of view from multiple times are used to inform one another is brilliant and when you learn some final piece of a mystery in \"real time\" it hits that much harder. I've seen people complain about perspectives like the trial and the historians, but I personally found them to be a great way to show how others view the protagonists of fantasy stories and how important interpretation is. At times it reminds me of Rashoman.\n\nThe way that the series finishes is, in my view, absolutely phenomenal. Everything climaxes in an extremely satisfying way on both the large scale, and more importantly, for our characters. You also realize how much the themes from the short stories carried over to the novels themselves. >!Every faction seemingly wanted to control Ciri \"for the greater good\" (Except Vilgefortz who actually was just evil) and yet we learn that the doom she was prophesized to save the world from was just global climate change that was always going to happen in a few thousand years. Everyone willing to murder to control the chosen one was deluding themselves for personal gain, and she wasn't even the chosen one. Then you have Skellen who aligned himself with corrupt and evil people because he thought the wake of death and destruction he was leaving would be worth it because there was a long shot chance that it could possibly lead to democracy generations down the road.!<  Just as with the short stories, the people who want to control and shape the world as they see fit, even if for supposedly good causes, inevitably become the source of real evil. Not monsters or chaos, but the ones who are supposedly meant to protect. It all ties back to the first short story in The Last Wish.\n\nThen there's the final chapter. >!After everything he's been through, it's tempting for Geralt simply abandon the world and retire. After all, getting involved only results in pain and it would so easy to just decide to do what he always tells himself he will: stop worrying about others and only care for himself. And that's what the plan is, until a riot breaks out in the town where he's staying and innocent people are being attacked. Geralt realizes he can't just let these people be slaughtered. He rushes to their aid and dies in the process. Not from a vicious dragon or evil wizard, but a random guy who got lucky with a pitchfork. It's tragic and yet strangely perfect.!< \n\nThere were parts of the series that at the time felt like they dragged, but once I finished I was extremely happy that I read it. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to read an atypical approach to fantasy writing.",

        "body": "Honest question, no flamebait etc. \n\nI grew up reading fantasy and sci-fi, almost everything I could get my hands on. I read the greats - Tolkien, Heinlein, Bradbury, etc. I was really into Dragonlance at one point. My fave sci fi series is Robotech, and fantasy is Lone Wolf.\n\nI sort of grew disenfranchised with fantasy in the early 2000s, it seemed to be very repetitive and the same tropes kept being repeated. Did NOT get what the big deal with Harry Potter was, and I've read all the books and seen all the movies (once again not trying to start anything art is subjective) Also read Sanderson a bit, don't see what the big deal is again. \n\nSame with a lot of what I have been recommended...Dragonbone Chair? Ehhhhh. Newton's Cannon. Ok or so. I'm just very picky, having read hundreds of spec fic books. I sort of turned to video games to get my fix. Warcraft's story is very meh, but FF14 is astoundingly good. Did not like the later Dragonlance books (seriously, Raistlin being revived is jumping the shark)\n\nThe most recent spec fic I read that wowed me is The Windup Girl. I've read some indie \"blockbusters\" but they fail to do anything to me.\n\nNow that I am older and wiser I see things in \"ages\"...there is always going to be rise and fall. I am seeing interesting fantasy books come out over the last few years. Also, there's my work, but I'm not supposed to promote it :) \n\nWhile the world is always changing, the tropes tend to remain the same. I avoided Wheel of Time because it was high fantasy and not that all interesting. Same for Game of Thrones - anything Martin does, Matsuno (Final Fantasy Tactics writer) can do better (once again, opinion) I thought the Witcher series was really interesting though, even though it didn't really reinvent the wheel.

Dandelion is no warrior, he’s a wimp with no discernible combat skills. The only female character is Triss, making her seem more like a token. What about Yennefer or Cirilla? Who even is this Yarpen guy that he rates a spot? Basically, I’m wondering why those 4 characters and not other, more notable, capable and/or popular ones? I’ll note here, my only experience with the Witcher universe is the Wild Hunt video game. There’s a lot I don’t know so I may simply be missing something that makes those characters make sense.",

        "title": "Despite an extremely busy 2020, I read 47 SFF books and exceeded my reading goal. Here are my rankings.",
        "body": "This year I managed to read 47 books despite finishing up my last year of law school, working 2 jobs, and studying for the bar exam (I passed!). It's a huge milestone for me, but more importantly it was a ton of fun. \n\nI was an avid reader as a kid but gave it up in high school and university. I finally picked up reading fantasy again in 2017 and have slowly been ramping up the number of books I have read. After reading 30 books in 2019, I set a goal of reading 40 books in 2020. Really happy that I was able to exceed that.  Here are my favorite reads, ranked from best to worst.  **Please note these are all audiobooks so the narrator also played a role in the rankings.**\n\n***-------Fantastic-------***\n\n**Red Rising by Pierce Brown (5)**\n\n*Red Rising (book 1) - Dark Age (book 5)*\n\nAfter reading almost exclusively fantasy from 2017-2019 I was a little hesitant to read this series. The marketing gave me way too much SF young adult vibes. But boy am I glad I stuck with it. This series is now one my favorite of all time. \n\nThe protagonist is incredibly well-written and relatable. The prose is magnificent. Darrow's musings during the books are profound and it really feels like you are actually in his shoes looking at a solar system that is riven with strife and suffering due to the machinations of the ruthless ruling class. The plot is very fast-paced but the conflicts and their resolutions feel organic and unforced. The foreshadowing is excellent, the dialogue is engaging, and the setting is breath-taking. It's hard not to get enamored with a future where humans have terra-formed all of the major celestial bodies the solar system. \n\nOverall, this is in my top 3 series of all time. The characters, prose, dialogue, plot, everything are done masterfully. I highly recommend it. I love this series so much I splurged on some special editions.  \n\n**Dune by Frank Herbert (6)**\n\n*Dune (book 1) - Chapterhouse: Dune (book 6)*\n\nDespite being SF as well, Dune is the opposite of RR in many ways. Instead of having a very tight linear plot, Dune seems to wander around, spending large sections of the books on dialogue between characters with the major plot events not occurring for many pages. But I still ended up loving this series. The Atreides characters are incredibly well-written and evoke a ton of awe and mysticism. The Dune universe and its power structure (between the Empire, the Landsraad lords, CHOAM, the Bene Gesserit) is really interesting, and I love how the Atreides have to navigate these structures to achieve their goals, with the fate of humanity resting in the balance.\n\nBut more importantly, I think the wonder of these books is not the struggle against external forces, but the internal struggles the protagonists face.  Herbert's writings of the character's inner thoughts is extremely interesting. How they plan out their strategies against their enemies. But even moreso, how they plan to deal with their own demons. Abilities to see the future, live hundreds of years, or remember the lives of ancestors sound amazing, but there are real tradeoffs and it's refreshing to see how Herbert writes this inner turmoil. I think some of his political and philosophical insights are really cool too. Another aspect I love is the screen-time he gives to the villains, showing their plotting, their own internal power struggles, and their cunning. If you are a SF fan and have not read these, definitely make sure you do, you won't regret it. \n\n**The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher (11)**\n\n*Fool Moon (book 2) -- Changes (book 12)* \n\nLike RR, I avoided the Dresden Files for a long time because I didn't think I would like urban fantasy that much, always preferring epic fantasy myself. But boy was I wrong. The depictions of the various mythical creatures are really cool and varied. There are different types of werewolves, vampires, fallen angels, etc. I especially love the interactions and political intrigue between the different magical factions. \n\nI will admit that I did not find the books as interesting at first, but once Butcher introduces the whole cast of characters and the recurring characters start to play a bigger role, the series takes a major step up. I liked book 2 a lot, 3 and 4 ok, but book 5 was where things really started to heat up. The next books are incredible. So action-packed. Harry himself starts to power up in a way that's real and believable, and Butcher does a great job of raising the stakes and making the villains even more powerful as the series goes on. It's nice to see him tie in characters and elements from previous books as the series progresses. Small Favor, Turn Coat, and Changes, the most recent books I have read from the series, absolutely blew my mind. I can't wait to get all caught up. \n\nTotal: 22 books\n\n***-------Very Good-------***\n\n**The Burning by Evan Winter (2)**\n\n*The Rage of Dragons - The Fires of Vengeance*\n\nHeard about the Rage of Dragons on Reddit and I'm very glad I decided to check this series out. Very fast-paced and interesting. A lot of secrets and world-building that come out across the first two books that make me want to learn more about what the author has planned. The protagonist is cool and I love how he powers up during the first book. His development is not as interesting in book 2, but it's still there. The introduction of new characters in book 2 is really interesting though and I'm curious to see how they develop. The magic system is interesting as well and the characters are very likable. \n\n**Dawnshard by Brandon Sanderson (1)**\n\nI've read a ton of Sanderson books and I ended up really enjoying this novella. Rysn is one of my favorite interlude characters and I enjoyed following her journey. Plus, two of my favorite \"creatures\" of Stormlight: the Larkin and the Dysian Aimians, are featured heavily so I loved getting to learn more about them. Finally, the introduction of the Dawnshards, the mythical and terrible weapons of mass destruction, which I have been speculating about for years, was so amazing and makes me even more hyped for the rest of Stormlight.\n\n**Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson (1)**\n\nFinally got around to reading Warbreaker and was not disappointed. The beginning is a little slow but the plot is very interesting and the characters are likable. I'm happy to see the crossover with Stormlight and hope we get a sequel soon. \n\n**Powder Mage Trilogy by Brian McClellan (3)**\n\n*Promise of Blood (book 1) - The Autumn Republic (book 3)*\n\nAnother series I heard about on Reddit that I absolute have come to adore. This series has it all. A gritty old general who successfuly leads a coup and now has to manage ruling a nascent country while defending his borders from a hostile powerful neighbor. A detective who has to solve a mystery related to a traitor. And the general's son, a powerful powder mage who can fire bullets with pinpoint accuracy who has to face down a monumental threat. This is another super fast-paced and action-packed series. I absolutely love the general, Field Marshal Tamas. For WoT fans he reminds me a lot of Davram Bashere and Rodal Ituralde. Really cool military genius who also has a lot of hilarious scenes. The characters are fantastic, the plot is tight and enjoyable, and the dialogue is incredible. Fantastic series. \n\n\n**His Majesty's Dragon (Temeraire) by Naomi Novik (5)**\n\n*Throne of Jade (book 2) - Tongue of Serpents (book 6)*\n\nI love the dynamic this series has -- a very close bond between a British Naval officer and a rare dragon he captures from the French when its still an egg. The man has to adjust being part of the aerial corps, which has its own political problems in the the Britain of the early 1800s, while the dragon (Temeraire) has to use his great intellect and ferocious power to help effectuate social and political change. The two have a very wholesome bond that is really fun to see. And the depictions of aerial combat with people riding dragons and dropping bombs on other dragons, or trying to land on another dragon and take its captain hostage, are really cool. The pair also travel the world and the depictions of early-1800s Europe, Africa, China, etc. are all very interesting. \n\nTotal: 12 books\n\n***-------Good-------***\n\n**Rhythym of War by Brandon Sanderson (1)**\n\n*Book 4 of the Stormlight Archive*\n\nI'm a huge Stormlight fan, but this book was kind of a letdown. The mental health issues definitely resonate with me and a lot of other people, but I feel the focus on those issues in the first half of the book really made it drag. Aside from the early battle, the rest of the first half just seemed to drag on with Kaladin and Shallan issues. The middle battle and it's consequences were really cool, but then it just got very technical with a lot of lore dumps and the Shadesmar mission which again seemed to drag on. The big Shallan reveal was also pretty clear ahead of time because of all the foreshadowing. I like foreshadowing, but not when there's so much that it blunts the impact of the big reveal. Kaladin's big scene was cool, but it felt like it took a lot to get there.\n\nHonestly what I think this book really needed was more Dalinar. He's obviously going to play a major role in this entire conflict and it's really weird to me that he has such a minor role in the book, especially in light of the set up for book 5. The limited scenes we got with Dalinar were excellent, but I would have liked to see more. And the big reveal was really cool, and I did not see it coming. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the book. But the pacing was off, the different plot threads were disjointed, and I never felt fully immersed. One part that makes Stormlight so great is the world-building, and here all of the characters were basically sequestered in their own areas so there was not a lot of world development. Even the interludes, which are cool for their introduction of new characters, were just used as a vehicle to show the perspectives of recurring characters (save for the Sja-Anat one, which was actually great). This was clearly the set up for book 5, which I am still excited to see. \n\n**The Heroes by Joe Abercrombie (1)**\n\nLiked this book a lot. The battle scenes are very interesting. The inner turmoil is real and well-written. And of course I love how Bayaz's machinations are shown. The plot and dialogue and writing are all excellent. I just was not as invested in these characters (minus Bayaz) as I was in the other First Law books. \n\n**Catch and Kill by Ronan Farrow (1)**\n\nOkay, I know this is cheating, because it's a non-fiction book and not actually SFF. But trust me, the things in this book read as if they are SFF. This is the story of how former NBC reporter Ronan Farrow broke the Harvey Weinstein story with the New Yorker. It's harrowing story of elites abusing their power and using any means possible to discourage attempts to hold them accountable. The espionage angles are particularly fascinating. Worth a read if you are curious about modern attempts to intimidate and manipulate the media. \n\n**Sins of Empire by Brian McClellan (1)**\n\n*Book 1 of the Gods of Blood and Powder Trilogy*\n\nSequel to the Powder Mage Trilogy, has some of my favorite characters from the first series but in an entirely new setting. It's a cool book with an interesting plot and great battle scenes. I just did not find the new characters as engaging as the ones from the first trilogy. I will continue reading the trilogy and expect I will come to enjoy the characters just as much as I did for the first trilogy. \n\n**Magician's Apprentice by Raymond Feist (1)**\n\n*Book 1, part 1 of the Riftwar Cycle*\n\nGreat story, classic epic fantasy with the twist of enemies from a different world transporting themselves into this one. Has goblins, dragons, and magic. I really liked the characters and expect to continue. I only managed to read the first book however as others on my list jumped ahead.  Once the rest of the narrative develops and the protagonist properly levels up, I expect to really like this series though, and thoroughly enjoyed book 1.\n\n**The Goblin Emperor by Kate Addison (1)**\n\nThis book is often recommended as one about political intrigue and court dynamics. I can see why, the new emperor of the elves (who is half-goblin) has to try to unite the kingdom in the wake of the murder of the previous emperor and his heirs. It's a good book, with a lot of really wholesome scenes. The emperor's advisor happens to be a great guy and very capable, despite only being a messenger boy originally. I just didn't find there to be that much political intrigue. The villains are very plain from the get-go and never really change their minds on the protagonist. It's not like the protagonist convinces them or out-wits them to change in his favor. And the whole gambit against him is foiled just through sheer luck, if I recall correctly. Don't get me wrong, it was a fun read. Just not really my cup of tea. \n\n**The Witcher by Andrzej Sapkowski (5)**\n\n*The Last Wish (book 1) - Baptism of Fire (book 5)*\n\nI'm a big fan of the Witcher games and show, so I was hoping the books would be enjoyable. And for a while they were. The stories not shown in the show are really cool. I enjoyed the story about the guy in the forest who's a demon, and has young women come by to stay with him for a year. I loved the story about the young woman bard who falls in love with Geralt. And the story of young Ciri with Geralt is very fun too. I basically enjoyed everything until the Tower of the Swallow and the teleportation. Then Ciri's story is a big bore, and Geralt's is kind of interesting but the pacing is off. I'll keep reading it, but I was kind of disappointed at how the story stalls. \n\nTotal: 11 books\n\n***-------Bad-------***\n\n**-46. The Burning White by Brent Weeks (1)**\n\n*Book 5 of the Lightbringer series*\n\nI absolutely LOVED the early books in this series. Really cool world-building, excellent dialogue, and very interesting characters. Gavin and Andross Guile were excellent characters, and the interactions between Andross and Kip were very fun. Gavin was also very charismatic and the pacing of the early books made it really fun to watch him go about all his tasks. Even book 4 was good with its slower pacing just because it had a ton of secret reveals and crazy revelations.\n\nThen this book happened and it just ruined the whole series for me. This book has the mother of all deus ex machina. Gavin's whole story is straight trash. I'm sorry for those who liked the book, but the way his entire arc is resolved is just infuriating. The revelation with >!the mirror-man!< is interesting, but the rest is just nonsense. Completely robs >!him of any agency or opportunity to be the hero by allowing God to show up and tell him it's all ok, explaining the purpose of the knife, and helping him get to the battlefield. So God has a private jet? What the fuck? And he just jumps out Fortnite-style to battle with Khoios? That's really how they kill Khoios?!< It's so terrible in my opinion.\n\nThen you have >!Kip, who doesn't get to play the hero role either. He just gets to be tortured on the giant mirror and somehow doesn't die, even though he should have long passed the point of death. He gets to survive and even get his powers back (or so we suppose based on the hints).!< There is no real explanation of the >!angels/demons from other worlds, and the part of Kip's guardian angel is so unremarkable and boring.!< \n\nIt had some cool flashes but overall it was a terrible letdown. \n\n**-47. The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang (1)**\n\nThis book has been talked about a lot on Reddit, and most threads summarize the issues pretty well. I wanted to give it a shot because the premise seemed interesting, but what I got was just a really boring version of the Sino-Japanese war, which makes the plot predictable as someone who has studied the war. It starts off with a protagonist who's really smart and beats the odd to get admission into a really prestigious school, so you think her brains and the school are going to be relevant. Nope, the school is just a convenient angle to introduce a bunch of characters. The whole magic school thing completely falls away to just be full blown war and misery. \n\nThe main character is not really that interesting. She's just a vessel for the author to explore the other characters. The only thing we really see is the obsession/fear the main character has for Dalton, but the main character never really has her own personality or anything that made me find her story interesting. And Dalton is just perpetually described as charming and mad and high, using different adjectives to describe the same state. A villain, who she beat the shit out of at one point, shows up at the front and she and him suddenly get along like out of nowhere. She joins a band of misfits, but none of the characters in that group are actually fleshed out to the point where they are enjoyable. Like imagine if Avatar: The Last Airbender was just Katara pining for a depressed, junkie Aang and no one else got any screentime. And those who do fall flat because the dialogue is just extremely weak and boring. I struggled to finish the book. The magic and god systems were also weird and poorly explained. Overally just a disappointing read. \n\n***------End-------***\n\nOverall it was a great year, filled with many long nights spent listening to the audiobooks way past my bedtime. But it was well-worth it. For posterity, I thought I would include my overall rankings of all fantasy books I've read if people are interested: \n\nA+\n\n- Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan\n\n- Red Rising by Pierce Brown\n\n- Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson\n\n- Dune by Frank Herbert\n\n- Dresden Files (1-12) by Jim Butcher\n\n- A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin\n\nA\n\n- Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb\n\n- Codex Alera by Jim Butcher\n\n- Under Heaven by Guy Gavriel Kay\n\n- Temeraire (1-6) by Naomi Novik\n\n- The Burning by Evan Winter\n\n- Kingkiller Chronicles (1-2) by Patrick Rothfuss\n\n- Powder Mage Trilogy by Brian McClellan\n\n- Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson \n\n- The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie\n\n- Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson\n\n- The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison\n\n- Riyria Revelations by Michael Sullivan\n\nB\n\n- Percy Jackson by Rick Riordan\n\n- American Gods by Neil Gaiman\n\n- The Witcher (1-5) by Adrzej Sapkowski\n\n\nC\n\n- Night Angel Trilogy (book 1) by Brent Weeks\n\n- American Gods by Neil Gaiman \n\n- Lightbringer (because of the end) by Brent Weeks\n\n- The Poppy War\n\n\n**Please don't take offense to any of these rankings, it's entirely subjective based on my own preferences. Just because I didn't like these books does not mean you will not like them. I avoided reading Wheel of Time for years based off the criticisms of Egwene and Nyneave and the so-called \"slog.\" I ended up loving the series and none of those criticisms resonated with me. You may feel the same about these books above. That's okay! Just enjoy what you want and screw the rest.**\n\nMy goal for 2021 is to read 50+ books. Already finished with one. If you have any recommendations based on this list please feel free to share below! Thanks for reading!",

        "body": "Hey fellas,\n\nAtm I'm searching for something to read that features disabled protagonists. (I also take disabled side characters if they're appearing for more than a short hello.)  \nI don't have a preference if it is a high/low/urban/etc fantasy setting, but I really want disabled main characters that do not get cured somewhere along the story (like in \"Eona\" or Eragon in \"The Inheritance Cycle\") and they should not be inspiration porn for others. (Like with endless \"Oh they're sooo brave fighting the darkness despite being blind\"-comments.)  \nSubtle disabilitys are welcome as well (e.g. Geralt of Rivia >!has in later books issues when it is cold or when he fought too much since he never healed completly at brokilon!<). Or Characters gaining a disability during the story and adapt and continue their story with it.  \nSo: Do you have any recommondations for me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank y'all for giving me that many recommondations! They're all really interesting. Gonna browse through all of them tomorrow when I have more time, since I got a lot more answeres than I expeted since my initial search really disapointed me.  \nFeel free to continue adding books here. I am happy for every single bit input :)  \n",

        "body": "Time of Contempt has a lot of great moments peak one being Geralt and Yen's reunion in Thanedd but I will talk about another more subtle one which is the similarities drawn between Tissaia and Geralt in that book.\n\nWhile reading the books for the first time, between 'Blood of Elves' and \"Time of Contempt\", Tissaia is shown in two moments. Margarita, Ciri, Yen and her bathing and the part where she talks to Vilgefortz and Terranova. Between the two moments you clearly see she is the only one besides Triss that has in-depth knowledge about the complex and long relationship of Yen and Geralt. You can see that Yen is close to her, maybe akin to a mother figure(the depth and importance is fully appreciated at the very end of the books in that moment we all know). Both moments give the vibe of her liking Geralt for Yen.\n\nIn saying this, when the sorcerer banquet begins and Geralt interacts with different members of that world, my main interest was the discussion between Tissaia and Geralt but cleverly so the author 'skips' that discussion simply by saying Tissaia mentioning a heroic deed of Geralt in the past. The conversation with Vilge also gives some hints : \n\n\n\"My genetic vagabond, that Tissaia de Vries smiles at. My witcher, mercenary that fascinates Philippa Eilhart, so that both of her hands tremble. At the mention of, makes Triss Merigold blush. Not to mention Yennefer of Vengerberg.\"\n\nInstead he shows us through Tissaia's actions during the coup. Her 'neutral' actions speak volumes and by not choosing sides she pays a heavy price which she regrets just moments after with more people dying. It mirrors Geralt's thoughts about neutrality when Dandelion was telling him about Foltest agreeing to a peace treaty with Emhyr during his healing period in Brokilon. The conversation I wanted of both becomes unnecessary because it's clear later why Tissaia likes him. The 'show, don't tell' style pays off.\n\nIndirectly through Tissaia and her education of Yen another layer is added to why Yen and Geralt are that drawn to one another.\n\nAnother small thing before finishing, Philippa might have been her best student in terms of potential and ability as Tissaia states herself but as one clearly understands when it comes to character, Yen was her favorite.\n\nTwo times has Yen participated in the Lodge's meeting and both times she mentions Tissaia both as a provocation but also a reminder to Philippa that Tissaia's legacy lives on. Especially poignant in the meeting where Ciri is present where you can see to Margarita's pleasure and Philippa's dismay that Ciri comes from Tissaia's school of education.",

        "body": "I find interesting the similarities between Vilge and members of the Lodge especially the most ambitious ones Philippa, Sile etc, both in the height of their powers and in their downfall. \n\nBoth parties take pride in reaching the peak of their magical might and funnily so both think their gender is the superior one. The Lodge regards males as too emotional with impossible ambitions/dreams. In short hopeless romantics. Vilge straight up says to Geralt in Stygga that the other gender is inferior. The most important factor that both think they have is leaving behind 'petty and unneccesary emotions' in favor of gaining the most power in the continent.\n\nStarting with Vilgefortz, his downfall is directly tied to his connection with Geralt. I have mentioned my thoughts on this a few times before in other threads here so will keep it short. They have both quite similar upbringing and lifestyle in their early days but their paths differ later. Vilge wants to validate his path, the path of power while mocking Geralt's choice. The connection they have becomes personal in their two confrontations and Vilge wants to give some 'lessons' to Geralt instead of killing him on the spot. You can call it nostalgia for his old mercenary days or Vilge founding another person that could have walked the more unique path he did, the path of gaining the best of both worlds. This more human connection results in his eventual downfall.\n\nThe Lodge has a more subtle but equally interesting touch with their human side. Their two biggest undertakings are : Keeping Geralt and his friends occupied with trivial matters in Toussaint through the charm of Fringilla Vigo and the most important one that is deciding Ciri's fate in the end of LotL.\n\nFringilla managed to put Geralt temporarily under her control for several reasons which we all know so won't go in detail. In the end the player got played with Geralt tricking her and the Lodge consequently. As Philippa says most underestimate the witcher, some more than others. Fringilla ultimately developed feelings for Geralt which created a weak spot in her. This was never stated but hinted especially when she debated with Regis. The higher vampire eloquently shatters her believe that Geralt will stay with her. It's a fleeting dream, one that it is about to end as he said.\n\nMoving on to the most important undertaking and that's using Ciri for their political interests and gain great power in the continent. Their so called unison and determination for the sake of magic and power within the Lodge crumbles when deciding whether to let Ciri go to Geralt in Rivia. Triss puts her personal feelings in the forefront especially wanting the forgiveness of Geralt, Margarita sees parts of Tissaia in the girl and caves in, Fringilla for her connection with Geralt also caves in with ultimately even the mighty leader of the Lodge Philippa caving in. Suddenly these 'unneccesary emotions' that the Lodge vowed to remove in their first meeting dominate the majority of the members of organization.\n\nUltimately with Ciri's departure, the Lodge's ambitions fall and as we are shown from the glimpses of the future, they were systematically hunted down(CDPR also does a well thought and interesting take on the witch hunts in their 'what if' game sequels).\n\nSorry for the long post as usual 😁",

        "body": "The Empire of Nilfgaard is prosecuting its invasion of the North with a three-pronged assault on the remaining free kingdoms. The allied nations make ready to receive them in the largest battle in living memory. Meanwhile, Ciri has learned how to use her powers to travel between worlds, but her ability to control them remains questionable. Geralt, the witcher, and his band of companions reach the fairytale kingdom of Toussaint in their pursuit of Ciri, but face difficult decisions on how to find the missing princess.\n\nThe **Witcher** books are an odd bunch, with two volumes of tightly-plotted short stories followed by a five-volume novel series which can be best described as meandering. Sapkowski takes in a lot of stories, characters and ideas in the series, but sometimes it feels like a certain focus is lacking. Main characters vanish for books or half a book at at time and it sometimes feels very random what major events will be depicted on-page or left to a side-paragraph in a later volume to be referred to. Sapkowski's witty dialogue and fine grasp of politics, character and action makes these narrative tangents entertaining, but it's hard to ignore the feeling that this could have been a stronger, tighter trilogy with some firmer editing.\n\nHowever, and it feels like against the odds, Sapkowski ties his flabby narrative together here in the concluding volume with a surprisingly well-constructed ending. Character and story arcs stretching back to the short stories are rounded off well, and the main storylines revolving around Geralt's hunt for Ciri (not since Mario has a hero been so frustrated by the target of his search always being in another castle) and Nilfgaard's invasion are both resolved with surprising emotional power.\n\nThe novel follows several narratives in parallel. The main story is Ciri's, as she learns how to use her power to move between worlds (including our own) and finally learn how to stand on her own two feet and make decisions rather than be subject to the whims of others. Behind her is Geralt, whose story suffers a little from him always being a few steps behind Ciri, and not having indulged in any actual witchering for some considerable time. People used to the **Witcher** novels and video games may be surprised at Geralt's relatively low-key presence in this volume, although his story does climax in an extended battle sequence with he and his friends getting into a fight which they don't all survive. Sapkowski's characterisation of Geralt's band of allies has been good enough that it hurts a bit when not all of them make it (though gamers may be somewhat cheered that, at least in CD Projekt's version of the story, a couple of the characters who apparently bite the dust here do survive to return later on).\n\nAnother major story follows the military conflict and it's here that Sapkowski strikes gold, for the complex, multi-front Battle of Brenna is simply one of the finest battle sequences in fantasy this side of the Blackwater, Joe Abercrombie and Paul Kearney. The action is crisp and clear (even when the characters can't tell what the hell is going on), the consequences of the battle well-told and the conflict depicted without any glorification or glamour, just a lot of people dying unremarked in the mud for political causes they don't understand. I was extremely impressed by this extended sequence, where Sapkowski makes excellent use of some of the side-characters and stories he set up in earlier novels.\n\nThe semi-tragic finale is perhaps a bit disappointing, leaving the fates of too many characters up in the air, but it feels true to life and true to this world to leave things with a touch of ambiguity (although, again, the video games do present a non-canon, alternative idea of what might happen next). More entertaining is the discussion of the great prophecy about the end of the world, which is savagely stripped of all the traditional fantasy cliches and revealed to be a simple discussion about a scientific, natural process, which I did enjoy for subverting expectations. In fact, Sapkowski's theme in this book is that those expecting cliches and tropes to be employed without irony have definitely come to the wrong series.\n\n*Lady of the Lake* (\\*\\*\\*\\*) wraps up the **Witcher** series in style.",

People used to the **Witcher** novels and video games may be surprised at Geralt's relatively low-key presence in this volume, although his story does climax in an extended battle sequence with he and his friends getting into a fight which they don't all survive. Sapkowski's characterisation of Geralt's band of allies has been good enough that it hurts a bit when not all of them make it (though gamers may be somewhat cheered that, at least in CD Projekt's version of the story, a couple of the characters who apparently bite the dust here do survive to return later on).\n\nAnother major story follows the military conflict and it's here that Sapkowski strikes gold, for the complex, multi-front Battle of Brenna is simply one of the finest battle sequences in fantasy this side of the Blackwater, Joe Abercrombie and Paul Kearney. The action is crisp and clear (even when the characters can't tell what the hell is going on), the consequences of the battle well-told and the conflict depicted without any glorification or glamour, just a lot of people dying unremarked in the mud for political causes they don't understand. I was extremely impressed by this extended sequence, where Sapkowski makes excellent use of some of the side-characters and stories he set up in earlier novels.\n\nThe semi-tragic finale is perhaps a bit disappointing, leaving the fates of too many characters up in the air, but it feels true to life and true to this world to leave things with a touch of ambiguity (although, again, the video games do present a non-canon, alternative idea of what might happen next). More entertaining is the discussion of the great prophecy about the end of the world, which is savagely stripped of all the traditional fantasy cliches and revealed to be a simple discussion about a scientific, natural process, which I did enjoy for subverting expectations. In fact, Sapkowski's theme in this book is that those expecting cliches and tropes to be employed without irony have definitely come to the wrong series.\n\n*Lady of the Lake* (\\*\\*\\*\\*) wraps up the **Witcher** series in style.",

Like, from that desert place to the Trappers, to the guys at the inn wanting to \"check\" that she's a real girl or some such ,to being first \"saved\" by Kayleigh by not saying she's wanted by Nilfgaard, to then same Kayleigh attempting to rape her. To being saved by Mistle, who goes ahead and has her way with her and rapes her anyway, like dude??? I don't even understand how she can rightly reprimand Kayleigh and do the same thing he set off to do(I guess there's nothing to understand, just the cruelty of life?). That whole scene just made me uncomfortable, not sure I'm prepared for the next book. Having played the games before reading the book and developed this fatherly relationship with the Ciri character in the game, reading that made an already awful experience much worse, imagining your child going through that. \n\nI'm a first time reader of the books. I haven't been this sad since Sword of Destiny >!with Essi's story and her death!< \n\nAlso just contrasting this ending with that of Blood of Elves makes it more heartbreaking. \n\nAnyway, that's enough of that. Enjoying the books greatly, not much of a big reader myself but have blown through the first four books in 3 weeks which is a huge feat for me since it takes ages for me to read lol",

        "body": "Hello,\n\nI really struggle to find a book that I would enjoy so would appreciate any recommendation. I prefer a medieval-like world and magic but I'm open to anything if the story is good. I don't mind if the hero is male/female, I prefer a slightly darker supernatural mood and character that is not good to the level that he/she is just stupid. I don't mind a \"special\" hero but don't want a chosen one who is always better than the rest and learns everything with supernatural speed just because the author keeps saying so - not saying I want a hero that always gets kicked in the teeth, just someone who is a little bit real.  I think that GoT would be a good fit but after Kingkiller, I would like to avoid series that likely won't be finished. I love books that have both male and female characters so brotherhood books are not for me. Don't mind if religion is presented but don't like when it is a dominant feature (like in King's dragon).\n\nBooks that **I really enjoyed**:\n\n**Witcher** \\- totally love this world and strong supporting characters\n\n**Kingkiller chronicles** \\- Kvothe is maybe the most interesting hero I've ever read about, I love that this zero to hero transformation didn't happen overnight and that Kvothe can actually lose, cry, make bad decisions, and is not the typical do-gooder and can play dirty to get what he wants. Supporting characters are super interesting, and the story is not predictable. His journey makes sense and I really felt engaged.\n\n**Anita Blake** \\- first 5 books only, enjoyed the supernatural, dark atmosphere, and her detective work. So I wouldn't mind a book that also investigates supernatural crimes.\n\nWhat **I didn't enjoy** even though it was recommended as similar, sorry for negativity but will try to add a few notes why:\n\n**Lies of Locke Lamora** \\- reading right now but to be honest I find his story really unengaging despite amazing reviews - still best from the list below, the author certainly knows how to write, I'm just not interested in the hero. When he is on a mission, I admit I skip pages because it bores me\n\n**Prince of Thorns** \\- flat characters with an annoying main hero who is constantly presented as a dark genius sexy mastermind who always knows something that others don't on every single page X.x storyline jumps from one time to another. tbh don't understand the good reviews this book gets\n\n**Ranger's apprentice** \\- zero to hero overnight, Will is a genius better than anybody else, always knows better, and is loved wherever he goes because he is just so amazing. The story is naive and everything is resolved immediately\n\n**King's Dragon** by Kate Elliot: the story is absolutely epic but the number of religious talks totally killed it, author needs 2000 words to say that someone put a shoes on, also both main heroes are quite weak, supporting characters were more catching\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I feel like a top complainer but still hope someone will be able to recommend something :D so thanks to anyone!",

I mean, they are his men after all, add that the Wild Hunt killed the escort of Geralt and Yen in the first place, so he even has a personal reason to seek revenge. \n\nAlso Geralt and General Morvran are mostly on friendly terms (horse racing, banter). Geralt not only refuses the free help but Emhyr just accepts that he's willing to gamble Ciri's life with less boots on the ground. Idk, i find it out of character for both of them. The dialogue option you choose makes no difference, so why put it on the game at all? What do you think?",

        "body": "I probably shouldn't be asking this because I'm halfway through my reread of the Cosmere, but I got the dumb idea of \"Die Hard in a fantasy setting\" and I'm wondering if anyone's done anything like that. I could kind of see Time of Contempt as a bit of that, though it's only a small part.\n\nEither that or an actual detailed Leverage style heist. The two usual ones that come up when people ask for heists are Mistborn: The Final Empire and Lies of Locke Lamora, and while I really like the first, it's not really got much in the way of heist (though it does have the \"and here's what really happened behind the scenes\" moment) and then the criminality goes right out the window for the sequels, and the second is absolutely the exact opposite of a heist, though I won't get into my problems with the first of the Gentlemen Bastard novels for spoilers. It just doesn't actually have much heisting, even if it does have thief characters pulling a con.\n\nBut what do I mean by heisting? I mean a group of people with special skills, possibly magical, trying to pull off some con or break into or out of something secure. Skin Game, of the Dresden Files, is a pretty good heist novel, complete with a third act twist that recontextualizes earlier scenes.",

        "body": "The reason I love the Witcher saga so damn much is the level of nuance and subtlety present in it. The intricately detailed and **real** characters that Sapkowski writes and how their relationships get affected by their obvious flaws creates such a sense of relatability, just take Yen & Geralt's relationship, I'm sure anyone with an 'It's complicated/On again off again\" thing in their lives absolutely relates to it.\n\nIt saddens me to see that despite mostly amazing casting choices, they choose to go the Hollywood action route with WITCHER of all things, a series which makes an extreme effort to show that all it's superhuman characters are extremely human and just as fallible and chooses not to focus on the action unless it's driving story beats like Ciri's fight with Bonhart or the LOTL scene, both very pivotal moments in Ciri's life. (A series which has an entire story with the main characters just fucking around in a city drinking with one character's ex chasing him around and another shown as a stockbroking genius)  \n\n\nContrast that with Nilfgaard, an imperialist roman-ish empire turned into some sort of cult a.k.a *the evil empire,* Cahir & Fringilla becoming typical evil villains again, Yen being the best student in Aretuza just because she's the main character, No development of Ciri/Geralt's relationship basically removing all the subtlety from the 'Destiny' trope and just making it **magic** and lastly knowing that they'll probably be skipping stories like 'A Shard of Ice'/'A Little Sacrifice' because they're not actiony enough or never even attempting to portray the subtlety of those stories makes me extremely sad as a person who is extremely attached to the Witcher.\n\nI hope none of this is true and I read it all wrong and the next seasons are gonna be true to the books' core. (Though initially disappointed with my first watch, I have increasingly fallen in love with the first season after repeat viewings but I really hope they turn it up next season.)  \n\n\nP.S. Not even gonna address the rumours about Eskel.",

Digging into the mindset of a society that is so fundamentally *other* to our experiences is something that very few authors can accomplish well, but Le Guin does it beautifully. 5/5\n\nOptimistic: [*The Goblin Emperor*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/1f70e6d8-b445-4d02-9efc-fd158ca59355), Katherine Addison\\*.\\* One I hadn't heard of before it was recommended in the bingo thread, and ended up loving. It's nice to read about a protagonist thinking deeply about what is most right and most good. 5/5\n\nNecromancy: [*The Blood King*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/ff031b8e-e192-4297-97db-fc6976862c22), The Blood King (Chronicles of the Necromancer)*.* Another from my bookshelves. Reading this, book 2 in the series, I realized why I didn't pick it up immediately after finishing the first one some years ago. It's an interesting, classic epic fantasy plot, but the writing is just serviceable bordering on mediocre, with accompanying poor editing. Because it's fun, it gets a 3.5/5.\n\nAce/Aro: [*The*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/20776b0d-668b-415e-9e43-1b8da60e8bfd) [*Murder* ](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/1970ecbe-68e4-44ab-a221-fa72a185e85a)[*bot*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/d96fc3fe-464e-4643-8697-93f8024d4b9d) [*Diaries*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/b1ecf981-b549-4d32-95c7-0df911d8c732), Martha Wells\\*.\\* The four novellas, which to me read more as parts of a whole. Murderbot is amazing and relatable and I want its life. I'm really looking forward to reading *Network Effect*. 5/5\n\nGhost: [*Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/b7ce7ea4-f888-436a-9046-000eabc46dc4), Seanan McGuire. I enjoyed the small-town feel and the examination of \"moving on.\" Short, plot-light, but very good. 4.5/5\n\nExploration: [*The Sparrow*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/664146a8-68e1-485b-8dda-cca58bb0455f), Mary Doria Russell. Hood's balls, this was good. Pretty sure it will easily make my top 10 of all time. Yes, it re-treads well-trod ground, thematically speaking, but it does it so incredibly well. It was heart-wrenching and nerdy and funny. ∞/5\n\nClimate: [*Spinning Silver*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/b719777a-6634-4780-aae8-07a7dea9d168), Naomi Novik. I'd started the Temeraire series before reading this one, and am enjoying it, but this was so much better than I expected based on the first two books of that one. It seems rare to me to see such a thorough healing of old, nay, ancient enmities, though I may be mistaken. And there are just so many influences woven together in what seemed like an effortless manner. 5/5\n\nColor: [*The Blue Sword*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/1633f529-f5b1-4059-b765-1a9ef39531fd), Robin McKinley. Originally read this one for the hard mode of the Romance square, but like many of us, thought it wasn't really romantic enough to count. Still enjoyed it, including the *extremely* subtle romance, despite the tactical idiocy I may have ranted about in the book club discussion. 4.5/5\n\nBook Club/Read Along: [*Elric of Melniboné*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/6cd18a5d-ad12-48d3-8b52-45c761052843), Michael Moorcock. Also from my shelves. I'm a sucker for classic sword & sorcery, so Elric is right up my alley. This first one wasn't amazing, but I can see the seeds of something great. 4/5\n\nSelf-published: [*Descent*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/2188fe34-871d-4dd6-b084-f81cf9ad6a57), Diana Miller. I actually read this one before discovering bingo, near the beginning of April. A family member is in a Facebook group with the author, thought I might like it, and they were right. Nothing super deep, but a nice school-based adventure with demons and powers and death and destruction. 4/5\n\nEpigraphs: [*The Time of Contempt*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/e1d5a6c2-d194-44de-bc61-0614c841bd51), Andrezj Sapkowski (The Witcher). After reading the two short story collections I was really thrown off by *Blood of Elves*, which had far less Witcher and far less monster-slaying than I expected. Though I still would have liked more Witcher and Witching, I liked the second book quite a bit more, possibly because I was more prepared for the politics and war focus of the series. Ciri's really the protagonist of the series, in my opinion, and she really started to come into her own here. 4.75/5\n\n2020: [*The Unspoken Name*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/c6a505d8-1b3f-417a-8dc2-9cb136a2e74c), A.K. Larkwood. Good but not great. Lots of plot, especially for a standalone, and light on... most everything else. Enjoyable, but not particularly memorable. 3.5/5\n\nSchool: [*Into the Labyrinth*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/ae3d5132-9207-44d7-b9b7-aa8bdae36c3b), John Bierce (Mage Errant). Another fun, fast read, and a world with good potential. The writing is just ok, though. And I really liked the \"all-caster\" party. 3.75/5\n\nAbout Books: [*The Ten Thousand Doors of January*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/133529e4-30cf-44e7-a05d-6c47ea050b20), Alix E. Harrow. I'd seen a lot of people love this one, so I was disappointed. Ended up listening rather than reading, which was a good choice, but it still was merely good. It was dragged down in particular by clumsy social commentary and January being an idiot, which is forgivable when she's young, but not so much as she grows. 3.5/5\n\nMade You Laugh: [*The Lies of Locke Lamora*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/f92c9f88-0411-472a-9777-13133278294a), Scott Lynch (Gentleman Bastard). I could have used so many books for this square (I probably laughed the most at *The Sparrow*, in between bouts of tearing up), but this one was occasionally hilarious. It's been on my list for a long time, and I was really glad I finally read it. 5/5\n\nShort Stories: [*Classic Stories 1: The Golden Apples of the Sun/R is for Rocket*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/d8c96d32-83de-4575-9b4c-6cc1f5077d64), Ray Bradbury. Actually a combination of two short story collections (does that deserve a bonus accolade?), and another from my shelves. Bradbury is another author I have a well-developed love for, but his short stories seem to be a mixed bag. Liked the stories from *Golden Apples* less than those from *R is for Rocket*. Check out \"Frost and Fire.\" 4/5\n\nBDO: [*Pandora's Star*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/ecb91acd-4918-49f0-8842-2e44ef3a601f), Peter F. Hamilton (Commonwealth Saga). Slow in the beginning (that is, the first two-thirds), but if you enjoy space opera worldbuilding it's worth it. Hamilton's aliens are great. 4.5/5\n\nFeminist: [*Wild Seed*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/62aa5bc9-b75f-4512-bf66-a1bb6be9ee72), Octavia E. Butler (Patternist). I originally intended *Fledgling* for this square, but in the end decided its themes weren't firmly enough in the feminist category for a hard mode card. This wasn't my favorite Butler book, but was still very good. 4.25/5\n\nCanadian: [*Traitor*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/731dcab1-1be7-4928-a376-2f7bb55fa15f), Krista D. Ball (Collaborator). There's a decapitation in the very beginning. What else do you need to know? Short, quick, fun (despite all of the depression), and well-written. 4/5\n\nNumber: [*Seven Blades in Black*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/600605d6-62f9-4593-ba56-7e1c3159704a), Sam Sykes (The Grave of Empires). The world felt vivid but shallow and the framing story was almost better than the rest of it. But it was a good story with well-crafted relationships (though there was no \"good\" anywhere in the book). Would like to see some more character development. 4/5\n\nRomance: [Greenhollow](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/8fe1efd6-8dcc-440a-bb38-041f6118ea81) [Duology](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/82bbab68-be1b-4316-9458-2cf35c3dc113), Emily Tesh. A pair of mostly dreamy, peaceful novellas. A realistic relationship (though the time jump between them is a little disconcerting), and Adela is great. 5/5\n\nMagical Pet: [*Abhorsen*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/03c1ee52-8626-4255-a3db-e5547222ef64), Garth Nix (*Abhorsen*). It had been a while since I read the first two, but it wasn't too hard to jump right into this one. I enjoyed finally getting the lore and legends of the world. 5/5\n\nGraphic Novel: [*The Underwater Welder*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/42d4c224-953d-4084-8d95-a7106d1cf1b7), Jeff Lemire. The foreword likened it to an episode of *The Twilight Zone*, and I think that's entirely accurate. Plenty of extremely disturbing not-quite-rightness. 5/5\n\nPolitics: [*Fuzzy Nation*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/c0122d17-10e2-4f07-b2d4-5122b1cd2e5a), John Scalzi (Fuzzy Sapiens). I haven't read the original by H. Beam Piper yet, but this was great. Very critical of corporate ecological exploitation, and the end is reminiscent of *My Cousin Vinny.* 4.5/5\n\n**Misc Card**\n\nTranslation: *Men Without Women*, Haruki Murakami. Murakami has some weird stuff going on, but I still enjoyed the collection. I liked the last two significantly more than the rest, though none of them were bad. 4.5/5\n\nSnow, Ice, and Cold: [*The Traitor Baru Cormorant*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/087feba4-a183-4a87-a5d1-81ce3f8e9aca), Seth Dickinson (The Masquerade). Incredibly plot-driven but with well-crafted characters. Complex forces play against each other beautifully. 5/5\n\nOptimistic: *Mort,* Terry Pratchett (Discworld). Can you really go wrong with Terry Pratchett? I'm reading Discworld in publication order, and it's great seeing the books steadily improve. 4.25/5\n\nNecromancy: *Three Parts Dead*, Max Gladstone (Craft Sequence). Had seen this one recommended around here a lot, finally picked it up. Was great: excellently plotted, good characterization, incredible foreshadowing. Excited to pick up the next few in the series soon. 5/5\n\nAce/Aro: *Rhythm of War*, Brandon Sanderson (Stormlight Archive). Probably my least favorite of the Stormlight Archive so far, but as a physicist and musician I absolutely *loved* the Navani chapters. Also, that doesn't mean it was bad, just not quite up to expected standards. Still a good book, though I think I agree with the general consensus that there's a bit too much that could have been cut. 4.25/5\n\nGhost: *Lincoln in the Bardo*, George Saunders. Was my alternate for hard-mode ghost if *Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day* didn't work out, but I decided I was still excited about it. Glad I read it, because it was so very different and so very good. 5/5\n\nExploration: *A Closed and Common Orbit*, Becky Chambers (Wayfarers). Read the first book relatively recently, and if there's a time for a nearly plotless character study 2020/21 is probably it. I really enjoy the way Chambers writes aliens. 5/5\n\nClimate: *The Calculating Stars*, Mary Robinette Kowal (Lady Astronaut). The one that finished this card. Read basically the entire thing (barring the first two short chapters) in one sitting. Mostly the book made me angry, but also I want nothing more than to serve as a Jack-of-all-trades in a Mars colony (though I'll settle for the moon), so it really spoke to me. 5/5\n\nColor: *The Sable Quean*, Brian Jacques (Redwall). I read most of the Redwall books way back when, but there are a handful that have come out since that I haven't gotten to. This is one of them. Reading it reminded me why I loved this series so much. There were a couple of quirks I noticed this time around, mostly a little bit clumsy exposition, but overall Jacques' writing really held up. 4.5/5\n\nBook Club/Read Along: *Promise of Blood*, Brian McClennan (Powder Mage). I really like military fantasy, though this one kind of skirts that subgenre. Very creative magics, battles. Definitely getting to the rest soon(ish...). 5/5\n\nSelf-published: *Terms of Enlistment*, Marko Kloos (Frontlines). Blunt-force but well-incorporated social commentary, some extremely enjoyable military sci-fi, with plenty of plot, not just explosions. 5/5\n\nEpigraphs: *Ill Wind*, Rachel Caine (Weather Warden). Originally read this for climate, but it's definitely weather, not climate. Stylistically similar to Dresden Files. Read it for fun (which there's plenty of), not depth. 3.75/5\n\n2020: *Battle Ground*, Jim Butcher (Dresden Files). Speaking of Dresden Files.... I read *Peace Talks* and *Battle Ground* back-to-back, and liked this one quite a bit more than *Peace Talks*. Butcher has a gift for incorporating real consequences in a kind of pulpy noir urban fantasy. 5/5\n\nSchool: *A Deadly Education*, Naomi Novik (Scholomance). A great twist on the magical school trope, though again the social commentary is a little obvious. Paraphrasing a favorite quote from a review that I can no longer find, \"if you feed a teenage boy for two weeks you're definitely dating.\" 4.75/5\n\nAbout Books: *Libriomancer*, Jim C. Hines (Magic Ex Libris). Loved this one. I think it speaks to everyone who's ever wanted to jump into another world, and it was way better than the cover suggests it should be. 5/5\n\nMade You Laugh: *Past Due*, Elliott Kay (*Good Intentions*). The definition of a popcorn novel. No substance whatsoever, but it's delicious all the same. This one felt less like fantasy erotica and more like erotic fantasy. Read this one for the sex and explosions. 5/5\n\nShort Stories: LeVar Burton Reads. Picked up LeVar Burton's new(ish) podcast, in which he reads a wide variety of short stories from entirely unknown as well as well-established authors. Stories themselves are definitely hit or miss, but he's got a gift for storytelling. Won't rate this one, but highly recommend.\n\nBDO: *Fallen Dragon*, Peter F. Hamilton. Yes, another Hamilton for BDO, though this time it's not as classic of an Object. Loved this book. Great mix of mystery, military, and explorations. 5/5\n\nFeminist: *Adulthood Rites*, Octavia E. Butler (Xenogenesis). I read *Dawn* a while back, was excited to finally pick up the sequel. I love Butler's writing, her aliens, her humans... it's great. 4.75/5\n\nCanadian: [*The Summer Tree*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/e331a266-5194-4633-880d-885ec22488f6), Guy Gavriel Kay (Fionavar Tapestry). I was very conflicted about this book. In the end it tugged on my heartstrings enough that I think it was very good, but the world and the big plot (which fortunately doesn't take up much time in this one) is extremely Tolkien-derivative. Perhaps because I connected well with him, >!Paul's death (and resurrection) on the Summer Tree!<felt like it stabbed me in the heart. 4/5\n\nNumber: [*The Wind's Twelve Quarters*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/33ff6c32-8d27-4869-83a1-7ded764f3742), Ursula K. Le Guin. An excellent collection of short stories, most with some sort of political bent, though over wide-ranging topics. 5/5\n\nRomance: *The Cloud Roads*, Martha Wells (Books of the Raksura). Another great book (I see a pattern...). Raksuran society reminded me strongly of the Blood of the *Black Jewels* series, with the instinctive predatory hierarchy married to a sapient intelligence. The relationships were well-developed and the plot was good. 4.75/5\n\nMagical Pet: *Here Abide Monsters*, Andre Norton. Another of my favorite authors, but I was disappointed in this one. Not good, not bad, just a fine, traditional fantasy adventure, no depth. 3/5\n\nAudiobook: *A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms*, George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire). These stories reminded me why I love A Song of Ice and Fire, which had maybe been driven out of my head a bit by how bad the show turned out. Martin really does have a gift. 5/5\n\nPolitics: *Deep Space*, Ian Douglas (Star Carrier). Another military sci-fi with an interesting alien adversary. Good to scratch that naval-battles-in-space itch. 4/5\n\n**Stats for Fun**\n\nThe number of books from both cards that fit in each category:\n\n* Translation: 3\n* Snow, Ice, and Cold: 10\n* Optimistic: 22\n* Necromancy: 7\n* Ace/Aro: 5\n* Ghost: 8\n* Exploration: 11\n* Climate: 5\n* Color: 6\n* Book Club/Read Along: 14\n* Self-published: 5\n* Epigraphs: 5\n* 2020: 8\n* School/University: 3\n* About Books: 3\n* Made You Laugh: 19\n* Short Stories: 8? (collections = 1)\n* BDO: 2\n* Feminist: 7\n* Canadian: 2\n* Number: 6\n* Romance: 8\n* Magic Pet: 8\n* Graphic/Audio: 8\n* *Politics: 32*\n\n*The Ten Thousand Doors of January*, *Rhythm of War*, and *Past Due* tied for most categories filled, with 8 each. *And Chaos Died*, by Joanna Russ, had the least, at 0. (Unused, obviously, along with another 13 books in the misc log that were disqualified for various reasons, mostly author repetition.)\n\nVery late edit to add more stats for the stat gods, because I saw another post with some of these and thought it would be interesting for future reference:\n\nNew-to-me authors: 17 on HM card, 8 on other, for 25 total\n\nSequels: 3 on HM card, 9(ish - Dunk and Egg stories) on other, for 12 total\n\nGreatest # of Goodreads ratings: *Lies of Locke Lamora*, 238414\n\nLeast # of Goodreads ratings: *Descent*, 28\n\nHighest average rating on on Goodreads: *Rhythm of War*, 4.65\n\nLowest average rating on Goodreads: *Here Abide Monsters*, 3.59\n\nOldest: *Classic Stories I*, published 1952\n\nLongest: *Rhythm of War*, 1232 pages\n\nShortest (by square; the individual novellas were shorter): *Into the Labyrinth*, 178 pages\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nThough I read pretty widely within speculative fiction anyway, I still enjoyed being pushed out of my comfort zone occasionally. As you can see, I'm pretty easy to please, though part of that is being good at recognizing which books I'll enjoy and which ones I'll hate. I've definitely been feeling the need since finishing my hard mode card to branch out into some of the books that have been on my TBR for many, many years, especially since I've only been reading an average of 25-30 books/year for the last 8-10 years. Plus I really need to read the \\~800 books I own but haven't read yet. So I'll probably stick to a single hard-mode card in the upcoming bingo, especially with the other reading challenges I'm doing.",

The first card is a hard/[hero mode](https://app.thestorygraph.com/user_reviews/a22c6c45-ba53-4672-9723-dd5c9c01608a) card, which is what I set out to accomplish, and I also read a bunch of books that were just sitting around not accomplishing anything, which is anathema, so I ended up doing a second card mostly of books I felt like reading, not every one of which got a text review at time of completion. I'll say some words about each one after this short image:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hi8oqpawf4j61.png?width=5780&format=png&auto=webp&s=94347c22a0796055adcbf859e27242cd6a4f5b64\n\nNow my thoughts, mostly without reference to my previous reviews, which are linked to the title where available:\n\n**Hard Mode Card**\n\nTranslation: [*Dragon Sword and Wind Child*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/6869c874-449e-4f60-821f-b7d7bfca80e1), Noriko Ogiwara\\*.\\* Starting off these thoughts at a low point. I just didn't enjoy this one. Mostly, I found it boring. Not much else to say here, I guess. 3/5\n\nSnow, Ice, and Cold: [*The Left Hand of Darkness*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/ec63ec50-9fbe-435e-b0e6-057341f6a54b), Ursula K. Le Guin\\*.\\* The first one from my bookshelves. I love Le Guin, so I wasn't surprised to love this one, too. Digging into the mindset of a society that is so fundamentally *other* to our experiences is something that very few authors can accomplish well, but Le Guin does it beautifully. 5/5\n\nOptimistic: [*The Goblin Emperor*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/1f70e6d8-b445-4d02-9efc-fd158ca59355), Katherine Addison\\*.\\* One I hadn't heard of before it was recommended in the bingo thread, and ended up loving. It's nice to read about a protagonist thinking deeply about what is most right and most good. 5/5\n\nNecromancy: [*The Blood King*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/ff031b8e-e192-4297-97db-fc6976862c22), The Blood King (Chronicles of the Necromancer)*.* Another from my bookshelves. Reading this, book 2 in the series, I realized why I didn't pick it up immediately after finishing the first one some years ago. It's an interesting, classic epic fantasy plot, but the writing is just serviceable bordering on mediocre, with accompanying poor editing. Because it's fun, it gets a 3.5/5.\n\nAce/Aro: [*The*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/20776b0d-668b-415e-9e43-1b8da60e8bfd) [*Murder* ](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/1970ecbe-68e4-44ab-a221-fa72a185e85a)[*bot*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/d96fc3fe-464e-4643-8697-93f8024d4b9d) [*Diaries*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/b1ecf981-b549-4d32-95c7-0df911d8c732), Martha Wells\\*.\\* The four novellas, which to me read more as parts of a whole. Murderbot is amazing and relatable and I want its life. I'm really looking forward to reading *Network Effect*. 5/5\n\nGhost: [*Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/b7ce7ea4-f888-436a-9046-000eabc46dc4), Seanan McGuire. I enjoyed the small-town feel and the examination of \"moving on.\" Short, plot-light, but very good. 4.5/5\n\nExploration: [*The Sparrow*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/664146a8-68e1-485b-8dda-cca58bb0455f), Mary Doria Russell. Hood's balls, this was good. Pretty sure it will easily make my top 10 of all time. Yes, it re-treads well-trod ground, thematically speaking, but it does it so incredibly well. It was heart-wrenching and nerdy and funny. ∞/5\n\nClimate: [*Spinning Silver*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/b719777a-6634-4780-aae8-07a7dea9d168), Naomi Novik. I'd started the Temeraire series before reading this one, and am enjoying it, but this was so much better than I expected based on the first two books of that one. It seems rare to me to see such a thorough healing of old, nay, ancient enmities, though I may be mistaken. And there are just so many influences woven together in what seemed like an effortless manner. 5/5\n\nColor: [*The Blue Sword*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/1633f529-f5b1-4059-b765-1a9ef39531fd), Robin McKinley. Originally read this one for the hard mode of the Romance square, but like many of us, thought it wasn't really romantic enough to count. Still enjoyed it, including the *extremely* subtle romance, despite the tactical idiocy I may have ranted about in the book club discussion. 4.5/5\n\nBook Club/Read Along: [*Elric of Melniboné*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/6cd18a5d-ad12-48d3-8b52-45c761052843), Michael Moorcock. Also from my shelves. I'm a sucker for classic sword & sorcery, so Elric is right up my alley. This first one wasn't amazing, but I can see the seeds of something great. 4/5\n\nSelf-published: [*Descent*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/2188fe34-871d-4dd6-b084-f81cf9ad6a57), Diana Miller. I actually read this one before discovering bingo, near the beginning of April. A family member is in a Facebook group with the author, thought I might like it, and they were right. Nothing super deep, but a nice school-based adventure with demons and powers and death and destruction. 4/5\n\nEpigraphs: [*The Time of Contempt*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/e1d5a6c2-d194-44de-bc61-0614c841bd51), Andrezj Sapkowski (The Witcher). After reading the two short story collections I was really thrown off by *Blood of Elves*, which had far less Witcher and far less monster-slaying than I expected. Though I still would have liked more Witcher and Witching, I liked the second book quite a bit more, possibly because I was more prepared for the politics and war focus of the series. Ciri's really the protagonist of the series, in my opinion, and she really started to come into her own here. 4.75/5\n\n2020: [*The Unspoken Name*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/c6a505d8-1b3f-417a-8dc2-9cb136a2e74c), A.K. Larkwood. Good but not great. Lots of plot, especially for a standalone, and light on... most everything else. Enjoyable, but not particularly memorable. 3.5/5\n\nSchool: [*Into the Labyrinth*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/ae3d5132-9207-44d7-b9b7-aa8bdae36c3b), John Bierce (Mage Errant). Another fun, fast read, and a world with good potential. The writing is just ok, though. And I really liked the \"all-caster\" party. 3.75/5\n\nAbout Books: [*The Ten Thousand Doors of January*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/133529e4-30cf-44e7-a05d-6c47ea050b20), Alix E. Harrow. I'd seen a lot of people love this one, so I was disappointed. Ended up listening rather than reading, which was a good choice, but it still was merely good. It was dragged down in particular by clumsy social commentary and January being an idiot, which is forgivable when she's young, but not so much as she grows. 3.5/5\n\nMade You Laugh: [*The Lies of Locke Lamora*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/f92c9f88-0411-472a-9777-13133278294a), Scott Lynch (Gentleman Bastard). I could have used so many books for this square (I probably laughed the most at *The Sparrow*, in between bouts of tearing up), but this one was occasionally hilarious. It's been on my list for a long time, and I was really glad I finally read it. 5/5\n\nShort Stories: [*Classic Stories 1: The Golden Apples of the Sun/R is for Rocket*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/d8c96d32-83de-4575-9b4c-6cc1f5077d64), Ray Bradbury. Actually a combination of two short story collections (does that deserve a bonus accolade?), and another from my shelves. Bradbury is another author I have a well-developed love for, but his short stories seem to be a mixed bag. Liked the stories from *Golden Apples* less than those from *R is for Rocket*. Check out \"Frost and Fire.\" 4/5\n\nBDO: [*Pandora's Star*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/ecb91acd-4918-49f0-8842-2e44ef3a601f), Peter F. Hamilton (Commonwealth Saga). Slow in the beginning (that is, the first two-thirds), but if you enjoy space opera worldbuilding it's worth it. Hamilton's aliens are great. 4.5/5\n\nFeminist: [*Wild Seed*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/62aa5bc9-b75f-4512-bf66-a1bb6be9ee72), Octavia E. Butler (Patternist). I originally intended *Fledgling* for this square, but in the end decided its themes weren't firmly enough in the feminist category for a hard mode card. This wasn't my favorite Butler book, but was still very good. 4.25/5\n\nCanadian: [*Traitor*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/731dcab1-1be7-4928-a376-2f7bb55fa15f), Krista D. Ball (Collaborator). There's a decapitation in the very beginning. What else do you need to know? Short, quick, fun (despite all of the depression), and well-written. 4/5\n\nNumber: [*Seven Blades in Black*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/600605d6-62f9-4593-ba56-7e1c3159704a), Sam Sykes (The Grave of Empires). The world felt vivid but shallow and the framing story was almost better than the rest of it. But it was a good story with well-crafted relationships (though there was no \"good\" anywhere in the book). Would like to see some more character development. 4/5\n\nRomance: [Greenhollow](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/8fe1efd6-8dcc-440a-bb38-041f6118ea81) [Duology](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/82bbab68-be1b-4316-9458-2cf35c3dc113), Emily Tesh. A pair of mostly dreamy, peaceful novellas. A realistic relationship (though the time jump between them is a little disconcerting), and Adela is great. 5/5\n\nMagical Pet: [*Abhorsen*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/03c1ee52-8626-4255-a3db-e5547222ef64), Garth Nix (*Abhorsen*). It had been a while since I read the first two, but it wasn't too hard to jump right into this one. I enjoyed finally getting the lore and legends of the world. 5/5\n\nGraphic Novel: [*The Underwater Welder*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/42d4c224-953d-4084-8d95-a7106d1cf1b7), Jeff Lemire. The foreword likened it to an episode of *The Twilight Zone*, and I think that's entirely accurate. Plenty of extremely disturbing not-quite-rightness. 5/5\n\nPolitics: [*Fuzzy Nation*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/c0122d17-10e2-4f07-b2d4-5122b1cd2e5a), John Scalzi (Fuzzy Sapiens). I haven't read the original by H. Beam Piper yet, but this was great. Very critical of corporate ecological exploitation, and the end is reminiscent of *My Cousin Vinny.* 4.5/5\n\n**Misc Card**\n\nTranslation: *Men Without Women*, Haruki Murakami. Murakami has some weird stuff going on, but I still enjoyed the collection. I liked the last two significantly more than the rest, though none of them were bad. 4.5/5\n\nSnow, Ice, and Cold: [*The Traitor Baru Cormorant*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/087feba4-a183-4a87-a5d1-81ce3f8e9aca), Seth Dickinson (The Masquerade). Incredibly plot-driven but with well-crafted characters. Complex forces play against each other beautifully. 5/5\n\nOptimistic: *Mort,* Terry Pratchett (Discworld). Can you really go wrong with Terry Pratchett? I'm reading Discworld in publication order, and it's great seeing the books steadily improve. 4.25/5\n\nNecromancy: *Three Parts Dead*, Max Gladstone (Craft Sequence). Had seen this one recommended around here a lot, finally picked it up. Was great: excellently plotted, good characterization, incredible foreshadowing. Excited to pick up the next few in the series soon. 5/5\n\nAce/Aro: *Rhythm of War*, Brandon Sanderson (Stormlight Archive). Probably my least favorite of the Stormlight Archive so far, but as a physicist and musician I absolutely *loved* the Navani chapters. Also, that doesn't mean it was bad, just not quite up to expected standards. Still a good book, though I think I agree with the general consensus that there's a bit too much that could have been cut. 4.25/5\n\nGhost: *Lincoln in the Bardo*, George Saunders. Was my alternate for hard-mode ghost if *Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day* didn't work out, but I decided I was still excited about it. Glad I read it, because it was so very different and so very good. 5/5\n\nExploration: *A Closed and Common Orbit*, Becky Chambers (Wayfarers). Read the first book relatively recently, and if there's a time for a nearly plotless character study 2020/21 is probably it. I really enjoy the way Chambers writes aliens. 5/5\n\nClimate: *The Calculating Stars*, Mary Robinette Kowal (Lady Astronaut). The one that finished this card. Read basically the entire thing (barring the first two short chapters) in one sitting. Mostly the book made me angry, but also I want nothing more than to serve as a Jack-of-all-trades in a Mars colony (though I'll settle for the moon), so it really spoke to me. 5/5\n\nColor: *The Sable Quean*, Brian Jacques (Redwall). I read most of the Redwall books way back when, but there are a handful that have come out since that I haven't gotten to. This is one of them. Reading it reminded me why I loved this series so much. There were a couple of quirks I noticed this time around, mostly a little bit clumsy exposition, but overall Jacques' writing really held up. 4.5/5\n\nBook Club/Read Along: *Promise of Blood*, Brian McClennan (Powder Mage). I really like military fantasy, though this one kind of skirts that subgenre. Very creative magics, battles. Definitely getting to the rest soon(ish...). 5/5\n\nSelf-published: *Terms of Enlistment*, Marko Kloos (Frontlines). Blunt-force but well-incorporated social commentary, some extremely enjoyable military sci-fi, with plenty of plot, not just explosions. 5/5\n\nEpigraphs: *Ill Wind*, Rachel Caine (Weather Warden). Originally read this for climate, but it's definitely weather, not climate. Stylistically similar to Dresden Files. Read it for fun (which there's plenty of), not depth. 3.75/5\n\n2020: *Battle Ground*, Jim Butcher (Dresden Files). Speaking of Dresden Files.... I read *Peace Talks* and *Battle Ground* back-to-back, and liked this one quite a bit more than *Peace Talks*. Butcher has a gift for incorporating real consequences in a kind of pulpy noir urban fantasy. 5/5\n\nSchool: *A Deadly Education*, Naomi Novik (Scholomance). A great twist on the magical school trope, though again the social commentary is a little obvious. Paraphrasing a favorite quote from a review that I can no longer find, \"if you feed a teenage boy for two weeks you're definitely dating.\" 4.75/5\n\nAbout Books: *Libriomancer*, Jim C. Hines (Magic Ex Libris). Loved this one. I think it speaks to everyone who's ever wanted to jump into another world, and it was way better than the cover suggests it should be. 5/5\n\nMade You Laugh: *Past Due*, Elliott Kay (*Good Intentions*). The definition of a popcorn novel. No substance whatsoever, but it's delicious all the same. This one felt less like fantasy erotica and more like erotic fantasy. Read this one for the sex and explosions. 5/5\n\nShort Stories: LeVar Burton Reads. Picked up LeVar Burton's new(ish) podcast, in which he reads a wide variety of short stories from entirely unknown as well as well-established authors. Stories themselves are definitely hit or miss, but he's got a gift for storytelling. Won't rate this one, but highly recommend.\n\nBDO: *Fallen Dragon*, Peter F. Hamilton. Yes, another Hamilton for BDO, though this time it's not as classic of an Object. Loved this book. Great mix of mystery, military, and explorations. 5/5\n\nFeminist: *Adulthood Rites*, Octavia E. Butler (Xenogenesis). I read *Dawn* a while back, was excited to finally pick up the sequel. I love Butler's writing, her aliens, her humans... it's great. 4.75/5\n\nCanadian: [*The Summer Tree*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/e331a266-5194-4633-880d-885ec22488f6), Guy Gavriel Kay (Fionavar Tapestry). I was very conflicted about this book. In the end it tugged on my heartstrings enough that I think it was very good, but the world and the big plot (which fortunately doesn't take up much time in this one) is extremely Tolkien-derivative. Perhaps because I connected well with him, >!Paul's death (and resurrection) on the Summer Tree!<felt like it stabbed me in the heart. 4/5\n\nNumber: [*The Wind's Twelve Quarters*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/33ff6c32-8d27-4869-83a1-7ded764f3742), Ursula K. Le Guin. An excellent collection of short stories, most with some sort of political bent, though over wide-ranging topics. 5/5\n\nRomance: *The Cloud Roads*, Martha Wells (Books of the Raksura). Another great book (I see a pattern...). Raksuran society reminded me strongly of the Blood of the *Black Jewels* series, with the instinctive predatory hierarchy married to a sapient intelligence. The relationships were well-developed and the plot was good. 4.75/5\n\nMagical Pet: *Here Abide Monsters*, Andre Norton. Another of my favorite authors, but I was disappointed in this one. Not good, not bad, just a fine, traditional fantasy adventure, no depth. 3/5\n\nAudiobook: *A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms*, George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire). These stories reminded me why I love A Song of Ice and Fire, which had maybe been driven out of my head a bit by how bad the show turned out. Martin really does have a gift. 5/5\n\nPolitics: *Deep Space*, Ian Douglas (Star Carrier). Another military sci-fi with an interesting alien adversary. Good to scratch that naval-battles-in-space itch. 4/5\n\n**Stats for Fun**\n\nThe number of books from both cards that fit in each category:\n\n* Translation: 3\n* Snow, Ice, and Cold: 10\n* Optimistic: 22\n* Necromancy: 7\n* Ace/Aro: 5\n* Ghost: 8\n* Exploration: 11\n* Climate: 5\n* Color: 6\n* Book Club/Read Along: 14\n* Self-published: 5\n* Epigraphs: 5\n* 2020: 8\n* School/University: 3\n* About Books: 3\n* Made You Laugh: 19\n* Short Stories: 8? (collections = 1)\n* BDO: 2\n* Feminist: 7\n* Canadian: 2\n* Number: 6\n* Romance: 8\n* Magic Pet: 8\n* Graphic/Audio: 8\n* *Politics: 32*\n\n*The Ten Thousand Doors of January*, *Rhythm of War*, and *Past Due* tied for most categories filled, with 8 each. *And Chaos Died*, by Joanna Russ, had the least, at 0. (Unused, obviously, along with another 13 books in the misc log that were disqualified for various reasons, mostly author repetition.)\n\nVery late edit to add more stats for the stat gods, because I saw another post with some of these and thought it would be interesting for future reference:\n\nNew-to-me authors: 17 on HM card, 8 on other, for 25 total\n\nSequels: 3 on HM card, 9(ish - Dunk and Egg stories) on other, for 12 total\n\nGreatest # of Goodreads ratings: *Lies of Locke Lamora*, 238414\n\nLeast # of Goodreads ratings: *Descent*, 28\n\nHighest average rating on on Goodreads: *Rhythm of War*, 4.65\n\nLowest average rating on Goodreads: *Here Abide Monsters*, 3.59\n\nOldest: *Classic Stories I*, published 1952\n\nLongest: *Rhythm of War*, 1232 pages\n\nShortest (by square; the individual novellas were shorter): *Into the Labyrinth*, 178 pages\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nThough I read pretty widely within speculative fiction anyway, I still enjoyed being pushed out of my comfort zone occasionally. As you can see, I'm pretty easy to please, though part of that is being good at recognizing which books I'll enjoy and which ones I'll hate. I've definitely been feeling the need since finishing my hard mode card to branch out into some of the books that have been on my TBR for many, many years, especially since I've only been reading an average of 25-30 books/year for the last 8-10 years. Plus I really need to read the \\~800 books I own but haven't read yet. So I'll probably stick to a single hard-mode card in the upcoming bingo, especially with the other reading challenges I'm doing.",

        "title": "Charlotte Reads: Return of the Thief by Megan Whalen Turner",
        "body": " \n\n**So What’s It About?**\n\nNeither accepted nor beloved, Eugenides is the uneasy linchpin of a truce on the Lesser Peninsula, where he has risen to be high king of Attolia, Eddis, and Sounis. As the treacherous Baron Erondites schemes anew and a prophecy appears to foretell the death of the king, the ruthless Mede empire prepares to strike. The New York Times–bestselling Queen’s Thief novels are rich with political machinations, divine intervention, dangerous journeys, battles lost and won, power, passion, and deception.\n\n**What I Thought**\n\nIt’s never easy to end a series, especially when the series is as beloved as this one and the ending is decades in the making. I’m happy to report that in this case Megan Whalen Turner absolutely delivered on the kind of ending everyone in the series deserves.\n\nPart of what I like about this series is that it always tries something new to keep you on your toes, and I think in this case Turner has written her most interesting narrator yet in Pheris, a disabled and disfigured young boy who is nearly universally despised and held in contempt. He’s an excellent character and a challenging narrator with his determination to play dumb as often as possible and his suspicion and loneliness that bloom into fierce loyalty to Gen. It is immensely difficult to read about the hatred that the world throws at him and I treasured every victory that came his way from him discovering his love of math and bonding with Relius and the magus to learning how to ride with the help of a friendly stablemaster. You see how meticulously he keeps track of every slight and every act of kindness because these mean the difference between life and death for him, and I am so glad that he ends up saving the day and finding his place in court.\n\nI will say that the handling of perspective felt a little ungainly in this book compared to the others – there are long stretches that fall into third person before switching to Pheris’s first person again. The abrupt changes bothered me. My other major complaint is that there are a truly massive number of servant/attendant characters to keep track of, which quickly became irritating.\n\nMostly, though, *Return of the Thief* delivers on the classic staples of the series – there are well-considered politics, intrigue and scheming that made me think hard and revisit passages before culminating in a number of very clever reveals at the end of the book. The second staple of these books is that Gen more or less acts like a giant diva, moody and petulant and charming and never without a really dangerous, complicated plan. In this case I loved how he funds people to denounce him to take the weight off of Eddis’s shoulders. I will say that Gen’s final plan in this book feels a little less elaborate and satisfying than they have been in past books, but it was still very rewarding.\n\nThere are finally gay characters in this world but they’re relatively minor and their presence does nothing to allay the irrevocable truth that *Kamet and Costis should be in love.* There are also some touches of feminism that get explored when Eddis faces dissent and doubt from her barons and Attolia fights to go to war while pregnant.\n\nIt was especially lovely to see the moments of bonding between Gen, Irene, Sophos and Helen, and all the other characters whose stories have intersected with theirs along the way. I especially liked seeing how Gen and Irene function as a couple now after their history of enmity and political marriage. It’s a pretty much perfect ending to a fantastic series and it will remain one of the best I’ve read, YA or otherwise.

        "body": "Warning: SPOILERS WILL NOT BE TAGGED so the first couple paragraphs are just background on how I read the books to avoid anyone scrolling accidentally seeing spoilers\n\nI began reading the Witcher series after watching the Netflix adaptation. I’ve never played the games (but have heard great things; The Witcher 3 is waiting to be played on my Steam account). Boy, I was not prepared at all for the richness and depth of this series!\n\nI started out with the collections of short stories. I finished *The Last Wish* feeling like I didn’t want to keep reading. I loved the story and the world, but the writing seemed so empty. As it turned out, it wasn’t the writing - it was the translation! I re-read *The Last Wish*, but this time read the fan translation. It blew my mind how much better it was. Then I read *The Sword of Destiny* and loved it. Next on the docket was *A Season of Storms*, which I ended up not finishing. I wanted to get to the main story!\n\nHappily, there was a different translator for the novels than for the short story collections. I decided to read the fan translation of *Blood of Elves*, then the official translation for *Time of Contempt,* then back to fan translation for *Baptism of Fire*. After that I kept to the official translations.\n\n**Things I didn't like**  \nThings I didn’t like mostly related to how the story was framed. I don’t when books use the structure of relaying events by having one character tell other characters what happened when those events take longer than one or two pages to tell, or when you’re taken “back in time” through that conversation. I don’t feel it adds anything positive to the story and I get disoriented trying to keep track of if I’m in the present or past when it changes every few pages. Reading on an e-reader exacerbates this since it’s more difficult to go back and check a detail. I also don’t like frequent POV changes during a single chapter, especially when the POV change isn’t explicitly clear about which character it is within the first five words. However, I am super jazzed to watch those sequences (especially the Ciri and Kenna describing Ciri's escape from Bonhart) in the Netflix adaptation. I like how that works in film/television, but not so much in print.\n\nIt was kind of weird to me that the world was pretty primitive technologically but really advanced in biological/genetic understanding. Part of the reason I didn’t finish *A Season of Storms* was the discussion of the genera and species of certain monsters. “Latin” binomials and taxonomy are relatively new, but we’re often told the story takes place in the 13th century. It took me out of the story too much.\n\n\n**Things that Confused Me**    \nWhy did Ciri’s hair have streaks of white in it in *The Lady of the Lake* and why did it upset Geralt so much?\n\nWhy was there a digression in *Tower of the Swallow* (I think) that seemed to depict Dandelion’s tube of notes being destroyed? We know the writings survived because they’re quoted at the beginning of several chapters, as well as being mentioned in the story.\n\nWhy is “Witcher” capitalized for Geralt, but Ciri is always “witcher” or “witcher girl” with a lower-case w?\n\nThank you to anyone who can shed some light on these!\n\n**Things I LOVED**    \nYennefer. What a brilliant character. I absolutely hated her in the early books - her selfishness and short temper made her so abrasive. By the end of the series, though, I would have killed for her. What a queen. Her fierce love for Geralt and Ciri made her such a realistic and relatable character. Just like with real people, love can smooth over our faults.\n\nGeralt is also an incredible character. For a series called The Witcher to have the titular witcher disillusioned with being a witcher and then lose his elixirs and swords halfway through the story is brilliant. To also have him die at the end was perfect and cruel. The last chapter broke my heart.\n\nCahir’s story is so sad that it made me angry. The guy betrays his country because he falls in love with Ciri, teams up with Geralt to help find her, and dies immediately after finding her. He is brave and good, and dies alone. Does Sapkowski just enjoy making his readers cry????\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I was completely unprepared for the depth of this series. The richness of the world, the diversity in characters, the complexity of politics and social issues, and the creative inclusion of fairy tales and myths resulted in a book series unlike anything else. I can't wait to see it brought to life on screen - I absolutely adore Henry Cavill as Geralt and am excited to see his portrayal. What did you all enjoy or not enjoy about this series?",

        "body": "Warning: SPOILERS WILL NOT BE TAGGED so the first couple paragraphs are just background on how I read the books to avoid anyone scrolling accidentally seeing spoilers\n\nI began reading the Witcher series after watching the Netflix adaptation. I’ve never played the games (but have heard great things; The Witcher 3 is waiting to be played on my Steam account). Boy, I was not prepared at all for the richness and depth of this series!\n\nI started out with the collections of short stories. I finished *The Last Wish* feeling like I didn’t want to keep reading. I loved the story and the world, but the writing seemed so empty. As it turned out, it wasn’t the writing - it was the translation! I re-read *The Last Wish*, but this time read the fan translation. It blew my mind how much better it was. Then I read *The Sword of Destiny* and loved it. Next on the docket was *A Season of Storms*, which I ended up not finishing. I wanted to get to the main story!\n\nHappily, there was a different translator for the novels than for the short story collections. I decided to read the fan translation of *Blood of Elves*, then the official translation for *Time of Contempt,* then back to fan translation for *Baptism of Fire*. After that I kept to the official translations.\n\n**Things I didn't like**  \nThings I didn’t like mostly related to how the story was framed. I don’t when books use the structure of relaying events by having one character tell other characters what happened when those events take longer than one or two pages to tell, or when you’re taken “back in time” through that conversation. I don’t feel it adds anything positive to the story and I get disoriented trying to keep track of if I’m in the present or past when it changes every few pages. Reading on an e-reader exacerbates this since it’s more difficult to go back and check a detail. I also don’t like frequent POV changes during a single chapter, especially when the POV change isn’t explicitly clear about which character it is within the first five words. However, I am super jazzed to watch those sequences (especially the Ciri and Kenna describing Ciri's escape from Bonhart) in the Netflix adaptation. I like how that works in film/television, but not so much in print.\n\nIt was kind of weird to me that the world was pretty primitive technologically but really advanced in biological/genetic understanding. Part of the reason I didn’t finish *A Season of Storms* was the discussion of the genera and species of certain monsters. “Latin” binomials and taxonomy are relatively new, but we’re often told the story takes place in the 13th century. It took me out of the story too much.\n\n\n**Things that Confused Me**    \nWhy did Ciri’s hair have streaks of white in it in *The Lady of the Lake* and why did it upset Geralt so much?\n\nWhy was there a digression in *Tower of the Swallow* (I think) that seemed to depict Dandelion’s tube of notes being destroyed? We know the writings survived because they’re quoted at the beginning of several chapters, as well as being mentioned in the story.\n\nWhy is “Witcher” capitalized for Geralt, but Ciri is always “witcher” or “witcher girl” with a lower-case w?\n\nThank you to anyone who can shed some light on these!\n\n**Things I LOVED**    \nYennefer. What a brilliant character. I absolutely hated her in the early books - her selfishness and short temper made her so abrasive. By the end of the series, though, I would have killed for her. What a queen. Her fierce love for Geralt and Ciri made her such a realistic and relatable character. Just like with real people, love can smooth over our faults.\n\nGeralt is also an incredible character. For a series called The Witcher to have the titular witcher disillusioned with being a witcher and then lose his elixirs and swords halfway through the story is brilliant. To also have him die at the end was perfect and cruel. The last chapter broke my heart.\n\nCahir’s story is so sad that it made me angry. The guy betrays his country because he falls in love with Ciri, teams up with Geralt to help find her, and dies immediately after finding her. He is brave and good, and dies alone. Does Sapkowski just enjoy making his readers cry????\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I was completely unprepared for the depth of this series. The richness of the world, the diversity in characters, the complexity of politics and social issues, and the creative inclusion of fairy tales and myths resulted in a book series unlike anything else. I can't wait to see it brought to life on screen - I absolutely adore Henry Cavill as Geralt and am excited to see his portrayal. What did you all enjoy or not enjoy about this series?",

        "title": "When you want \"great characters\" what are you looking for?",
        "body": "I want a fantasy series with great characters, is an oft heard thing on r/fantasy. By reading these requests and the examples that go with them (both positive and negative) I've come to realize that people seem to mean a few different things by this statement, and I wanted to try articulating the different kinds of great character writing I've seen. (Obligatory of course there's overlap and not perfect as with all categorizations). \n\nTo me the main things I've seen are great character *voice,* really well done character *arcs,* and fun distinct *personalities* (ok I don't think personality is the correct word here, but I'm struggling to put a name to this third category so going with this for now)*.*  Also for each of these examples, there is a key distinction between doing these well with main characters/pov characters and doing it well with all the other characters. Some more details with examples.\n\n# Character Voice\n\nThis is when you immediately know the character from the words on the page. There's something distinctive and alluring that sucks you in, and this is intrinsically tied to the prose. \n\nSome Examples (used for illustration, lots of my favorite character voices are not listed)\n\n* Joe Abercrombie: often talked about for his fantastic characters. You start a chapter and no one needs to tell you that you're reading Glokta, or Ninefingers, or Monza, you know just from the prose itself. The way these characters see the world, and talk, and are so clearly very distinct people is such a highlight of the series. **But** it was seeing this series so frequently talked about as a character series that made me realize I'd never originally thought of it that way, since I'd been thinking of character series as being about character *arcs.* And while these characters do arguably go through an arc, it's not really a highlight or strong suit of the series imo.  \n* Tamsyn Muir. Gideon and Harrow the Ninth is another series I often see lauded for its characters, which again initially confused me. While I love Gideon/Harrow's voice (ok tbh mostly Harrow), I thought characters were a weakness of the books in that I couldn't keep track of any of the characters in Gideon outside of our protagonists and the main murderer, and Gideon's character arc just felt sudden and not well developed. Even Gideon's personality felt a bit bland to me (I like to hit things with my sword and joke around) so it's not what pops into my head when you say \"Great Characters.\" **But** I totally get what people mean when they talk about how well developed and fun Gideon's voice is. And I most certainly loved the allure of reading from Harrow's pov, such a highlight!\n* Shatter Me: This is a ya book that I recently read and felt super conflicted about the mc. On the one hand, I loved the way her voice is depicted. The trauma she'd gone through, the way she talks and thinks just shines and immediately drew me in. But my god, she's so so annoying and not proactive about anything, and her personality just super annoys me! It was a great example to me of the difference between enjoying a character's voice and enjoying a character's personality and was one of the inspirations for this post. \n\n# Character Arcs\n\nI love a fantastic character arc. Watching characters grow and change in ways that feel so real. \n\nExamples (again, I apologize that listing all my favorites would require way too much space, and not add that much more to my point)\n\n* Zuko from Avatar: I know I'm mostly talking about books, but it's hard to talk about amazing character arcs without mentioning Zuko, best >!redemption!< arc I've ever seen. But it took time, I felt he started out fairly boring.  Just a stereotypical one note villain. He did not have that immediate distinctive \"voice\" or personality. He grew into it, we were slowly shown his depth and how he changed, and we (or at least I) grew to love him. \n* Fitzchivalry Farseer: Watching Fitz grow from child to adult over three series/time periods was a phenomenal experience. This series also has good voice imo but not on the same level as the examples above (getting both does make this a highlight). But again, he wasn't someone who immediately make me think, wow the characterization and voice here is amazing. I fell in love with him more slowly as I felt his pain and watched him grow, or sometimes fail to grow. \n* Geder Palliako (Dagger and the Coin): He has one of my favorite character arcs and is one of the many highlights of Dagger and the Coin. At the same time, I'm very glad the whole series is not from his pov. I love reading his sections, but he's slimy enough I know I would not enjoy reading an entire epic fantasy series from his pov. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Character Personalities\n\nThese are the characters that are *fun* or *interesting* , that inspire me, make me love them, love to hate them etc. This one is super closely tied to both the other categories (great arcs usually require an interesting personality to be changed, and great voice makes that personality shine more strongly — but they aren't the same thing you can have one without the other.)\n\nExamples (yup, again restricting myself to three examples means so many favorites get left out).\n\n* Sanderson: yes, I know mentioning Sanderson brings out the controversy. But I was just so *confused* by all the posts I saw talking about how characters are a weakness of his and how bland and bad they are. These are the characters that inspire me to get up on my bad days, who make me stand up and cheer at their victories, and make me cry with their pain. I got to see a girl kick-ass by drawing unicorns! Some of these characters also have great character arcs (cough Dalinar, Shai, ) but mostly I just really love them. (ok, less so in some of his earlier books). But reading some of the (more articulated) criticisms, I realized that yes, the characters don't have that strong of voices or distinct speech patterns, and if that's what means a great character to you, I can understand why they might feel \"bland.\"\n* Royce and Hadrien (Riyria Revelations): Royce and Hadrien are *fun.* They have great banter, great interactions. I love watching them be badass, I feel for them when things go wrong. But I could totally understand if someone felt they were lacking, as I'd agree neither character has that much of a prose-voice. (though I think their dialogue-voice is excellent). And while they have character arcs that are enjoyable, they're nothing I'd rave about, or that are hugely central to the books. I'd say something similar for Legend of the First Empire series. \n* Gerald Tarant (Coldfire Trilogy) nails atmospheric villain all while playing a hero's role. Normally when I see villain protagonists (and Gerald isn't strictly the protagonists), they're more morally grey, or on redemptive tracks, or getting to know them as a protagonist some how leeches the atmospheric evil vibe from them (maybe a familiarity breeds contempt sort of thing?) not so with Gerald, who maintains himself as evil and powerful even when in a heroic role and I love him for it. Yes there is some arc, and yes some voice but he has this atmosphere when not in his perspective so I'll say it's not mostly a function of character voice nor is it really his arc that I'm particularly enjoying.\n\nDoes this resonate? What do you think of when you say \"great characters.\" And yes, I somehow managed to write an entire character post without talking about Murderbot.",

        "title": "Netflix Witcher Season 1 recap",
        "body": "Hey guys!\n\nSo I finished the first two books of the Witcher not too long ago so I decided to re-watch the Netflix series so here is my verdict.\n\nSo I am not going to lie, for some reason I did enjoy the Tv show, it has obvious flaws which I will get into, but overall it was really enjoyable. I heard ppl saying the show is insanely cringe which it did have moments like Geralt and Yen kissing whilst the witcher was doing his aard sign( I think), I know she boosts his power but that Kiss was cringe af. Other then that I do think it's kinda of hard to portray the Witcher withought it actually being cringe, especially since most of the characters, even if they are humanoids, are in a sense monsters, like they don't know how feelings work etc. so it might seem cringe, which is fine. Do let me know regarding the cringe moments cause I didn't find that many.\n\nSo the biggest flaw is how they tried to smash in 2 books into a season. Not only that, they added extra content such as Battle of Sodden which was only mentioned in the second book, not actually talked about that much. Then you had the 3 timelines.\n\nI understand that they wanted to fill as much content into a season as from what I understood the budget wasn't that insane and well, that in turn made them cut out a lot of necessary content. in In my opinion, the witcher books are every writers fantasy. The first book for example has 300 pages roughly. There is only one character that is thoroughly explored which is Geralt with Yen and Dandelion/Jaskier only showing up in a few stories near the end. You have no extensive battles that would require a lot of resources, the places were not anything special, usually a simple house with a couple of characters, mainly Geralt and some other random one, talking and discussing their views and what not. That's what really did piss me off. If the show writers just did the first book in season one, not only would they have used up less money, but the story would be so much more fleshed out. From what I grasped in the first book, it was basically to show off Geralt as a character and his views on the world as sort of this half human half monster like being. So yea, I am not sure what was the point of smashing 2 books in 8 episodes, especially if you want to conceive money and run time and what not, thought for what it was, it was actually pretty decent, the problem is they could have had an excellent season with less runtime, less money and everybody would have been happy, cause it seemed to me, like this show was made for only witcher fans, and as true fans we will watch anything witcher related, so it feels like a cash grab.\n\nOne of the additions that I actually really adored was the Yen backstory. Now I've only read the first two books and currently finishing the third one so no spoilers please! but in the books, there Yens and Istreds backstory wasn't that fleshed out. And here, I think they made an excellent decision in doing that. In the books, its a lot easier to write down that \"Geralt saw the hunchback past of Yen in here eyes\" or something like that but obviously on TV its alot harder to convey that so that choice was excellent, it really does show why they have the relationship that they have, both being cast offs with poor childhoods. So regarding Yen they really did pull her off I think.\n\nCiris story was actually pretty boring and stupid. I understand the black elf that he was sort of a person to drive Ciris story and give her some wisdom, but all in all he was pretty stupid. The way they used the Dryads was absolutely disguising. They were basically some random tribe doing nothing. In the books they are fleshed out so well that you actually are interested in them. Here, their just some random ppl who give Ciri some water to drink. The Doppler chasing her was also stupid, not only should the Dryads just straight up shot him on sight, but they also didn't blind fold him??? Idk, I don't really have much to comment cause that time line was boring and honestly just straight up bad.\n\nGeralts story was what we expected I think. Not much to comment here, he is the main character of the show and they didn't really add or remove anything to much.\n\nNilfgard was also a bit strange. Now I am not too aware of Fringila, I know she's supposed to look like Yen and Geralt ends up sleeping with her. If they decide to cut that part out I dont think its a big deal that she isn't white. Nilfgard itself looks a bit too much Nazi like which they are portrayed like that in sword of destiny, but thats only from the panic of other ppl and what not so that's was odd. Their armour we all know sucks and the Doppler story was god awful lol.\n\nSo all in all what they really should have done was show the first book with the Yen backstory and that would have been perfect IMO! But we got what we got. Adding the second book into this season was terrible as the second book had so many good short stories and I mean they were good af. Them just running by them with half of them removed is awful.\n\nThe actors that portrayed the characters.\n\n\\*Geralt. Henry Cavill I think really did pull it off. Now he is a tad too much buffed and too pretty, but I mean we can't expect them to find an identical looking person. His cursing and \"hms\" were awesome not gonna cap. Overall I think he really did pull it off, thought im not exactly sure regarding the times where he starts shouting, kind of sounds like batman lol, but it was fine tbh. I think he will be remembered for the Witcher just Like RDJ for Ironman if the show is popular enough.\n\n\\*Yennifer.  Anya Chalotra was fucking awesome. Now I know ppl were crying that shes a bit too black or bullshit like that, but again, she was awesome. Totally captured Yens passive aggressive comments and humour. Simply magnificent, don't have enough words to praise her, excellent job especially since this is her first major project, props to her.\n\n\\*Triss. Now Ik IK she is not a prominent character in the books though I would argue out of the side characters she is one of the main ones. I honestly had no problem with the casting here. Triss stans are just mad that they can't jerk off to her redhead, which isn't even red to begin with. The main point of her hair being mentioned is that it is the most unique out of all the sorceresses which this actress clearly has the best hair out of all of them. In the books, atleast in my language, she was described as having curly hair, which the actress Anna Shaffer clearly has, chestnut colour, which lets be honest can be passible for light brown. The main problem is that the makeup and dress ppl didn't do enough justice for her looks. In her IG she looks like a 20year old, in the show she looks mid 30s which tbh is their fault for portraying her like that. Like look at the picture below, is that not passible for Triss? They could have given her blue lenses or smth and it would have been fine. Her skin colour, like what? I never even noticed that she had a tad darker skin colour so idk what this bullshit of race equality is. It is pretty obvious that the show tries to make a mostly British cast and she is from the UK. Also for ppl wanting some insane actress to play her you have to realize that she is not that prominent in the books so there is no point in paying loads of money for an actress just so she would look more alike.  I think, so long as they stay true to Blood of Elves and Triss gets more screen time it will be totally fine overtime and the actress will shine. Again she wasn't that important in the first two books nor this season. The first interaction with Geralt was solid, she obviously wasn't the giggly kid we all love cause she didn't know who Geralt is. She had some screen time with the battle of Sodden, really liked the line of \"is he our new daddy\" sounds like classic Triss to me lmao. Again, I think we will see her more next season and she will be totally fine. Don't overreact.\n\n# \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mu4ymb8vem61.png?width=443&format=png&auto=webp&s=632832a4514f7589a82af5cf7b206cb6847377aa\n\n\\* Ciri.  Freya Allan I think did a solid job for the script she was given. I honestly hated her story, but for what it was I think she did the best she could, can't comment much else as I honestly had a hard time even staying focused during her arc.\n\n\\*Jaskier/Dandelion. Joey Batey, also, great casting choice. Really did capture the anoying yet entertaining bard that he is. Had a glimpses of him being a good friend to Geralt. Like srsly great performance.\n\nSide characters that I liked were Yarpen, really funny and a tad smart just like most of us like him. Tessia, whom I am not familiar with though I imagine I'll get to hear about her in later books was excellent. Queen Calanthe was also very good.\n\nThe actual episodes.\n\nThe first one was straight up pretty awful in the adaptation aspect they butchered that story, no pun intented, the whole Renfri conflict with Geralt was sooooo bad, they cuted out imporant dialogue and instead showed us a random battle between Nilfgard and Cintra, which I know did take place, but like it is not necessary to show it. Though I did like the addition of Geralt picking up Renfris badge or w.e that was as a reminder for the whole \"lesser evil\".\n\nEpisode two was also pretty bad, I liked the Yen part obviously, but the fact that they made this episode Geralts and Jaskiers first meet ever was pretty bad, Geralt being mad at Jaskier all the time came off not too well in my eyes and the whole dialogue was also pretty butchered so yea.\n\nEpisode three was really enjoyable, liked the whole Yen transformation in sink with the striga fight. IK it was a bit cheesy but overall I think its hard to portray the witcher story withought it actually being cringe so I didn't mind. Triss showing up their was a nice addition thought they should have made it so that they already  knew each other. I believe that story takes place after the Last Wish thought correct me if im wrong? if so then it would have been logical for Geralt to know Triss due to Yen and perhaps even start off their sad relationship in some way.\n\nEpisode four was also pretty butchered. The whole dialogue between Duny ,Calanthe and Geralt was pretty meh, they cut out a lot of interesting build up to the whole revel of Duny as a monster and the actually main plot of the Law of Surprise so that I didint like.\n\nEpisode 5 was pretty good, minus a few things, for one, the fact that Geralt was actually fishing for a Djin???? then the fact that Yen didn't hear Geralts wish was IMO really bad. One of the reasons Yen actually loves Geralt is that wish, in the books she litterly heard him say it and it sort of made her realize that he actually cares for her, unlike other ppl, and that it was a really kind gesture from Geralt, he did it willingly, knowing that their fates would be tied together. Also I believe there was a pope of sorts in the books who explained how Djins work and what wish Geralt needs to make in order to save her, that being cut out is sort of bad for non Witcher fans who don't know the backstory as well.\n\nEpisode 6 was actually really good, except for some Yen and Geralt interactions. Yarpen was awesome, so was the bard and obvsly Geralt and Yen. Really enjoyed the humour. What I disliked is the whole interactions with Geralt and Yen. Now its not the actual content, its the fact that they smudged in \"a shard of ice\" with the first sword of destiny short story and it turned out not for my liking. The way Shard of Ice was set up with the love triangle and the whole dynamic as to why and how yen views Geralt and Is and vice versa is so key and the fact that they cut that out its pretty sad. So yea they sort of smudged it into that episode and then the dragon for no reason just snitches Geralt out for regarding the wish and sort of forces their breakup, kind of like Shart of Ice. The reason for their breakup is similar in that episode like in the shard of ice, Yen thinks Geralts feelings are fake, the in episode due to the Djin and in the short story due to Geralt not being able to say he Loves her, but still, that short story was needed to fully explain their relationship, instead they threw in a couple of lines, which were key, but simply not enough.\n\nEpisode 7 was cool, I really enjoyed the interactions between Yen and the new students as well as Yens and  **Tissaia** , I think they were very well done and overall the whole political things were pretty interesting. It is kind of a key component to the Witcher series, kind of like in GoT, so hopefully they bring it up a notch in Blood of Elves.\n\nEpisode 8. This one I had mixed feelings, the Sodden battle was not really necessary but since they did I guess its worth a talk. Overall it was pretty epic, the one thing that was really frustrating was the actual magic and Yen standing on the tower non stop speaking with everybody was anoying af. Now Yen, who I know is an insanely powerful mage, just instagibs the entire Nilfgard force, but a mage like Triss and Tissaia was absolutely useless, I mean cmon, Triss playing plants vs zombies and building a wall of roots to defeat two soldiers ??? then proceeds to get burnt ? like what? I understand the shrooms were good but cmon, a wall of roots ? srsly? I know she aint the most powerful mage but like srsly root wall? Tissaia being useless was kind of sad as well. Also, that episode totally butchered Trisses character IMO. One of the reasons I believe ppl love Triss and even Yen fans can agree is that she actually cared for other ppl. Like what I got from the books was that Triss actually fought for her lands and for other ppl, even in the Witcher 3 she puts her life on the line for the mages of Novigrad. In the show, she seemed like she hardly wanted any part of that battle. Also doesn't she have a nickname Merigold the fearless??? which is more regarding her fighting prowess and not being scared in battle I think, obvsly I know the whole plot line with her being afraid to stand in the way of Phillipa and the lodge. In the show she seemed scared af building walls so idk what that was about. Geralts story was nice overall. I don't mind the fact that the whole mom interaction was a dream cause in the books that entire journey could have been interpreted as a one big dream, even if that wasn't the case, so that's fine. What really just ate me alive was the ending. I latterly was crying for 5 minutes at the ending of sword of destiny, here it ends on Ciri asking whos Yen. Now I understand that the show want's to foreshadow the whole family dynamic with Ciri, Yen and Geralt, the problem here is that even a blind person can see that that will happen considering that Yen wants a child, Geralt and Ciri are destined and well, Yen is Geralts lover. The fact that they named the episode much more shows that the show was actually made more for actual witcher fans then the entire audience.\n\nNow I didn't talk much about Ciris timeline mainly cause it was trash. I liked the foreshadow with the Dryads that if she doesn't follow destiny bad things will happen and on the next frame we see Nilfgard destroying Cintra cause Calanthe was scared giving up her child, in a way, to Geralt. The fact that they removed Geralt from the whole equation with the Dryads is just bad.\n\nThe timelines were definitely not as bad as ppl make them out to be, it was pretty easy following them if you pay attention.\n\nAnyway, there are more things to nit-pick. Obvsly they can't put everything into 8 episodes. The big problem is that they cut out a lot of good stuff in favour of unnecessary battles so it shows that the writers don't actually know the books strengths, which were never the actual story lines, even though they are really good. The character interactions is what drove the witcher to great heights. I love the Yen and Geralt chats, Geralt teaching Ciri about life, Geralts one sided love with Triss and they seemed to missed the boat on those things.\n\nSo in conclusion I did enjoy the TV show I would give it a 4/10 as an adaptation but looking at it like a standalone tv show it is a solid 7/8 out of 10, I think its gets a tad too much hate, thought I do understand where ppl are coming from, besides the Triss casting. I wouldn't be surprised if they did a GoT in reverse where the first season is mediocre kind of like GoT's 8th season and then the rest are fine. It is sad that the first season is where they mess up as you do need good character foundations which we get from the two books, example in the first we get Geralts view of the world, in the second we get more of that as well as the relationship aspect with Yen, Jaskier showing another side of himself besides being a cringy bard. Next season should be pretty good since they won't do the timeline bullshit and it should be more coherent if they stay true to Blood of Elves.  Lemme know what you guys thought:)!\n\nP.S sorry if the points where all over the place and if there were any mistakes, clearly not the writer that Andrew Sapkowski is lol",

        "body": "I guess I’m old school but I like the classic medieval fantasy with magical items (magic boots, magic cloak, etc), mythical beasts, high adventure, romance, a journey through various exotic locales and landscape types, etc. I just miss the sense of wonder in the magic and monsters and travel. \n\nThis seems very much out of style at the moment which is fine. But it seems like my two main options besides LOTR are Dragonlance and D&D novels and of course Kings of the Wyld.\n\nSo I guess I have two questions:\n\n1. What other sources of this type of fantasy are there? \n\n2. What “modern” epic fantasy best scratches each of these itches?",

I’m not interested in reading about two people meeting and falling in love. To be honest i’m not particularly interested in the « romance » part. Simply two people who love each other and do badass things together. \n\nActually, even better if they are in an open relationship, but obviously it’s perfectly okay if they’re not, i doubt there are many of those couples in fantasy yet, maybe it will come.\n\nThanks y’all !",

        "title": "A Review of All Dark Horse comic books about The Witcher so far (WITHOUT SPOILERS)",
        "body": "***1) Reason of State***\n\nThis comic book has decent drawings and character designs. The story was interesting, however, it was incredibly convoluted and very hard to follow. The characters spoke of 100 names like we knew them right from the beginning of the saga. None of those past characters and other new characters were introduced properly, that is why the story totally makes sense if you read everything from Fan Wikia or something. Therefore, I did not understand fully what was the conflict (I did when I read the summary). Many things were told mostly by the characters. It's a huge shame. Where is the golden rule of \"show, don't tell\"? Especially, in a comic book. Other than that, the action scenes were cool, the art design is top-notch (though not the best one). Being that you don't really know what was the conflict, this story is a far cry from general witcher stories of grey morality and so on. But understand that the story itself is not complicated (complicated stories aren't bad), it's just convoluted, meaning that it was delivered poorly.\n\n***2) House of Glass***\n\nNow, this is the story that I always wanted every comic to be like. The first thing to mention is that the drawings are beautiful with a fair share of darkness and an equal amount of elegance. In my opinion, this story comes very close to the stories from The Last Wish, the very first book about The Witcher. Yes, you've got that right. It is true about this comic book. It's all about that: wit, snarkiness, action, dark humor, and irony with a huge amount of catharsis. There are some twists and turns that you don't really see coming, and they are worked up excellently! In this comic, the topic of grey and black morality is touched once again, in addition to that, the regular motto of the Witcher saga about the humans being the true monsters is encompassed once again. Though that's not a perfect comic book obviously, there are some drawbacks, I agree. But I think that they are negligible when you have such an interesting and thrilling tale! Additionally, the personality of Geralt from the saga about his constant self-flagellating attitude to life is brought up in this comic. When he constantly says that he's \"just a witcher that does his job\" and thinks miserably about himself and his life. Lastly, For the first time (and maybe only time), the comic book's being short is not a problem. The story ends exactly when it should end.\n\n***3) Fox Children***\n\nWithout spoilers, I shall say that I liked that comic book for its way of adaptation of the Aguara passage from Season of Storms. There are two major changes: the adaptation is expectedly more action-y and some new characters and situations were added. In contrary to Season of Storms, Geralt is holding both of his swords intact. It's the only comic book so far that adapts something from the books directly. My opinion is that the adaptation is quite faithful, though not an exact one. Some changes were welcome, nevertheless, many of them were totally unnecessary. The drawing is good and attention to detail astonished me. People that wrote this comic really did read Season of Storms. However, the epilogue of this comic is a HUGE bummer, at least for me.\n\n***4) Killing Monsters***\n\nMy opinion about this comic is like ehhhh Meh? Well, obviously the style and drawing are fine. But the overall story is kinda forgettable? It isn't terrible, obviously, it just doesn't have any meaningful substance. This comic book only serves as a prequel to the Killing Monsters Witcher 3 trailer. So what's new? Nilfgaardians are bad? Well duh. Besides, killing the Fiend beast was rather unimpressive. As simple as that. On top of that, it's enormously gigantic, but in the trailer, the cut head of the Fiend was tiny in comparison. Well, I'm lying. The Fiend was gigantic in the story of the comic book, but when the story ended when the trailer begins, the head becomes tiny. That's weird and inconsistent. This comic book is read-only for diehard fans that want to know EVERYTHING about the witcher, for the rest of the people, this thing is most likely to get a pass by. There also an additional moment when Vesemir shits on Yen and I was not surprised at all.\n\n***5) Matters of Conscience***\n\nThis one is rather brief. The shortest of all of them I guess. This story was only needed to give closure for Saskia and Yarpen Zigrin's stories, all being in Vergen. Saskia got two huge mmm... additions to her story. Well, just kidding, you know what I'm talking about. This time the art style is just terrible and looks more like cheap sketches and concept-arts. Possibly, this short thing was written at the very last moment of the development of Witcher 3, when the content of Iorweth and Saskia was totally cut. The overall story is highly contrived and there will be no Iorweth (only a \"passing by\" mention). This little comic left me in a bad taste. For such a short story, there are way too many cuts between the present and flashbacks, this why the story felt inconsistent, these cuts were totally unnecessary. The closure for such great characters as Saskia, Yarpen Zigrin, and Iorweth was not satisfying at all, conversely, it was greatly anticlimactic. Even if you don't care for Vergen (for which you fought for in one of the choices of Witcher 2), those characters deserved much more. Nuff said.\n\n***6) Curse of Crows***\n\nI shall say it plainly straight - this comic book might be the worst one yet. It has the worst drawing and design. Ciri and Yen's designs are awful, just like everyone else. I want to talk about Ciri's nudity in this comic book right away. CDPR bragged so much about Ciri not being naked in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, only to bring up her nudity just in this comic. She is needlessly sexualized twice! Another thing about this comic is that the main heroes are dealing with their problems like if they are attending some kind of vacation. There are no high stakes whatsoever. There is no presence of something that will drive the plot. Our trio (Geralt, Yen, and Ciri) just move around from place to place. Also, the story has a terrible introduction. In fact, the comic book actually starts in Issue #2. Issue #1 is plain and blatant padding. So what do you think witchers like to do? Killing monsters? Having sex with sorceresses? Playing Gwent? Wrong! All they like to do is BATHING. Bathing, bathing, bathing, bathing, and once again bathing. What's after bathing? BATHING of course!!!! Now, seriously, this comic book shows bathing like bajillion times. Why was it so frequent? I guess it's done to have Ciri and Yen naked. When Ciri comes to Tavern, the first thing that she asks is \"where to bathe\". It was good for once or twice, but for many many times? You just get exhausted, because the plot is unwilling to move forward. So, the pacing is just terrible. As terrible as Yennefer's introduction. She just breaks into the plot like some kind of Kool-Aid Man from Family Guy. All of her presence in this story is mostly for fan service I guess. Because she serves no purpose overall. This makes the whole story of the comic book comical, non-serious, and most painfully hard to care about. As an exception for this comic book, I'm gonna spoil everything right away. Don't read further. You might think that Ciri, Yennefer, and Geralt finally spending time together sounds incredibly well? In our minds, it seems so. But this comic book is enragingly a letdown. The chemistry between those three is terrifyingly absent. Most likely thing is that CDPR is implying that Geralt refused to Yen and left her. Because this comic book takes place after the ending of the Witcher 3. Ciri is heartbreakingly rude to Yennefer and Geralt seems like he has lost his feelings for her. All of it is just cruel. Well, at least the \"Witcheress\" ending of Witcher 3 is confirmed to be canon, according to CDPR. That's the only good thing. Another complaint is that there are no interesting new characters. I know that comic books to video games usually have lazy writing, but still. There are many references to the Striga story, the new version is simply mediocre, or borderline terrible. We learn that some girl was cursed at the times of war with Nilfs. She and her brother were cursed and she turned into a shape-shifter Striga and her brother became a shape-shifter crow. I thought that we will get a backstory of why she was cursed, maybe there is some sympathy or grey morality. But no! That girl was revealed to be a little child-monster. She totally deserved her fate of being cursed. She was cursed for a very good reason. Oh boy, she is so evil that her innocent brother suffered because of her. There is literally no grey morality. This little girl is pure evil. She might be eviler than Azar Javed for that matter. If you would notice, many witcher villains usually have grey morality, but this one is just a living atrocity. Overall, it's a terrible comic book that I wish to never read, don't recommend it for you either.\n\n***7) Of Flesh and Flame***\n\nThis story is an odd one. On one hand, the art style in this comic is the best of all of them, in my opinion. Although it might be too bright and lighthearted in tone, some people may say so, because they prefer the Witcher to be dark all the time (Toussaint, Blood and Wine, anyone?). The character designs are excellent. Especially of Dandelion. In fact, he is incredibly handsome in this comic, looks surprisingly similar to Johnny Depp, felt somewhat like fan art than a canonic one, therefore, he was kinda hot. On the other hand, the story is rather forgettable. The beginning of the story and the kickstart was rather ridiculous. I know that this is just a short comic book, but still. The twist of the story was predictable from the very beginning. For the first time, we explore Ofier. This land was meant to be like Arabia, a land of thousand and one tales. Some bits of Eastern atmosphere was there, but only bits. The new Ofieri characters are just flat with no personality. The lack of exclusively Arabian tale monsters nor any references to the Arabian Nights tales was a huge letdown (djinn was mentioned and that's it). So the land of Ofier is not really different than the North? Where are the cultural delights? Where are the cultural flavors? In comparison, Toussaint is very different from the North. The abrupt and dissatisfying ending to this tale is rather fitting. This is not how I wanted to explore Ofier, in a shitty comic book.\n\n***8) Fading Memories*** (ongoing, not finished until August 10, 2021)\n\nThis story tells about Geralt's occasional monster contracts. The story is told in Poviss. I couldn't really talk much about this comic, because its story is also pretty dull. I don't really think that the last 5th chapter will be a revelation. The art style is pretty lackluster (though not terrible), especially after reading Of Flesh and Flame. I guarantee that you will forget about the names and the characters, in general, the day after the comic. A good thing would be that there is some intrigue and the pacing is good. Hope that the story will have a satisfying ending.\n\nSo, guys, this is it for the comic books by Dark Horse so far. We can see that there are very few worthy witcher stories in comics out there. I'm highly surprised that Triss Merigold is not appearing in any of those comic books, nor being mentioned. Most of the comic books are serving as a cash grab for the fans while telling some dull and uninspiring stories (though there are some good ones). It's no surprise because Dark Horse also writes comics for such mediocre game series as Assassin's Creed (the latest one is about Valhalla), and Assassin's Creed is about anything but the story (except Desmond trilogy of course). I never ever read any Polish comic books, because a) they are terribly drawn b) none of them are translated (even if they would be translated, hardly anyone actually cares for them). If I missed something, point it out below in the comments. Do not hesitate to write your opinions about these comics, if you already read them. It will be a lot of fun to discuss. Peace.",

        "title": "Yet another first time Bingo Card with mini reviews!",
        "body": "Hey everyone, I've been seeing a lot of the completed bingo cards with mini reviews and have loved reading and comparing my card to them so I thought I'd add my own here as well. Although I've been on r/Fantasy long before the past year this is my first time ever completing a bingo card and it's been such a fun challenge I'm already counting down the days for the 2021 card so I can plan my year out. But anyway here is my card and some short thoughts if anyone is interested!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/a/Wv4LoJm](https://i.imgur.com/a/Wv4LoJm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel translated from original language: The Time of Contempt (Andrzej Sapkowski)**\n\nRating: 3/5 \n\nSomething about this book never quite clicked with me, on the face of it it’s exactly the type of story I usually love but I always felt as though something was holding me back from enjoying it and honestly I’m still not sure what it was. I was able to enjoy listening to this book, it was a nice escape for a while, but nothing really hooked me in and made me want more. I plan to continue the series so hopefully I’ll be able to appreciate it a bit more down the line. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Setting featuring snow, ice or cold: The Sword of Kaigen (M.L. Wang)** \n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nI was so looking forward to reading this after seeing how much praise it received and the amount of times I saw it recommended here. I was left feeling so conflicted after it, parts of this I absolutely loved; the character development, the magic, the general feel of the book throughout and one of the best set pieces I’ve read in the middle of the novel. However, I just couldn’t let myself go enough to be absorbed into it, I think in part to the info dumps at the beginning and the constant changing of time increments which (albeit a tiny irritation) were just enough to throw me off a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel with Chapter Epigraphs: The Calculating Stars (Mary Robinette Kowal)**\n\nRating: 2/5\n\nYet another book I was looking forward to reading, it has been sitting on my TBR for so long I was glad to finally get an opportunity to get to it. I was quite disappointed with The Calculating Stars, once I finished I just had this feeling of an itch that was *nearly* scratched but just didn’t quite get there. This one just wasn’t for me personally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel featuring Necromancy: Sabriel (Garth Nix)**\n\nRating 2.5/5\n\nAn interesting story, I’m generally a sucker for anything necromancy related so I loved the idea of this and I loved the magic system. For me, I found the writing a bit dry at times and the pacing a bit random. I enjoyed it, but won’t be reaching for the sequels. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ace/Aero Spec Fic: Vicious (V.E. Schwab)** \n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nI loved this story, I actually knew nothing about it before I read it and picked it up purely because it fit this square and others spoke quite highly of it and I am so glad I did. The whole idea behind the story and the powers themselves were so intriguing and well written. I was glad it wasn’t just a typical good vs bad kind of story and actually explored the morality of characters and how a human would respond to having these wild powers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel featuring a ghost: The Curse of Chalion (Lois McMaster-Bujold)**\n\nRating: 4/5 \n\nAnother book I had never heard of prior to this bingo card and ever since I read it I have been kicking myself for not knowing about it before. This was well-written, interesting and mysterious throughout; I spent the whole time trying to guess at what was actually happening or what might happen only to be proven so delightfully wrong. One of my favourite reads of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel featuring exploration: The Children of Time (Adrian Tchaikovsky)** \n\nRating: 5/5\n\nIf you told me that I could read about, and sympathise with, a bunch of spiders before I read this I honestly would have laughed in your face. This was an incredible piece of work from start to finish, from the ingenuity of the world-building, the evident amount of research into spiders and their capabilities and how that could then be translated into the fantastical, the dichotomous presentation of the spiders vs the humans throughout the novel. Honestly the only fault I can think of with this book is that I almost got a spider as a pet before I realised what I was doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Climate Fiction: The Fifth Season (N.K. Jemisin)** \n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nThe only reason this book isn’t getting a full 5/5 is purely due to some of the writing style. I loved everything about this book but the 2nd person narrative just threw me a bit. Aside from that though, my oh my, what a book. Great characters, great magic system, great exploration of ideas and politics, really gripping in pretty much every aspect. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel with a colour in the title: The Priory of the Orange Tree (Samantha Shannon)**\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nI loved mostly everything about this book, despite some flaws I couldn’t put it down and found myself devouring the whole thing in a few sittings. However, pacing was a huge issue for me with this; the book spent so long going through small things in a lot of detail or spending a lot of time on characters that didn’t serve the plot at all and yet the ending was so rushed I actually had to go back over it to see did I miss something. I would definitely read again but yeah, pacing toward the end was a bit jarring. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Self-Published Novel: Unsouled (Will Wight)** \n\nRating: 2.5/5\n\nI wasn’t a massive fan of Unsouled to be honest. I see it recommended everywhere and it’s spoken of so highly I thought ‘this must be good,’ but I just felt a bit let down with it. I enjoyed the magic and I enjoyed the characters but I just kind of felt like I knew exactly what was going to happen very soon into the book and, well, I did. I have since persisted and finished the rest of the series and I love the rest, I think the series gets progressively better so I’m glad I stuck with it after Unsouled. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel published in 2020: Rhythm of War (Brandon Sanderson)** \n\nRating: 4/5\n\nA lot has already been said about this book here already so I won’t spend too much time on it. I felt there were some pacing issues and the book was definitely a tad longer than it needed to be in parts but generally speaking I loved this book. Not my favourite entry so far in this series but definitely great nonetheless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Optimistic Spec Fic: The House on the Cerulean Sea (T.J. Klune)**\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nHands down my favourite book of the year. Such an incredible, heart-warming story which was exactly what I needed at the time I read it. It’s exactly the type of book that can make you change your outlook on the world and how you relate to others and just give you that bit of hope that maybe everything’s alright and the world isn’t a clusterfuck of shit from every angle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel set in school/uni: Red Sister (Mark Lawrence)** \n\nRating: 2.5/5\n\nI read the opening line and I was ready for loving this; badass nuns with entire armies needed to kill them...eh yes please! Unfortunately I don’t think the book delivered as much as it could have. I loved the world and the characters but the writing and pacing of the book let me down; I think there was too much training and educational parts for me personally that I just found myself reading it to get to the next part rather than being lost in it. I feel like a traitor because everyone else seems to love this book but it just wasn’t for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Book about books: The Ten Thousand Doors of January (Alix E. Harrow)** \n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nAnother absolutely fantastic story from start to finish. I kind of suspected how it was all going to end before I got there but I just didn’t care; if anything it made me more keen to finish it in this case. I loved the characters and the idea of all the different worlds, the only annoying thing about the worlds were the ones that were mentioned briefly but we didn’t get to see and explore. I loved January as a protagonist almost immediately and I was so glad to see she got the ending she did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A book that made you laugh: Mort (Terry Pratchett)**\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThis was my first Discworld novel. Why have I never touched Discworld before you might ask? I’m an idiot, that’s why. This is exactly my type of humor and I don’t think I could love Death more if I tried. I listened to this book and it just added to it so much; it’s an old recording for anyone thinking about getting it but so well done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Five Short Stories: The Merry Spinster (Daniel M. Lavery)** \n\nRating: 2/5\n\nI just couldn’t like this collection, I spent most of the time trying to figure out which story was based on which fairy tale and even when I did figure it I was left wanting in how they were portrayed. The writing was excellent and I would be very keen to read something else by them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* r/Fantasy **book club: The City in the Middle of the Night (Charlie Jane Anders)**\n\nRating: 2/5\n\nThis book was incredibly frustrating. It held so much promise with fantastic and creative ideas but the execution just wasn’t great. All the characters felt underdeveloped with relationships that were mostly just frustrating to read and the plot and structure were a bit all over the place for me. I’d love to read some more of Charlie Jane Anders' work because I loved the ideas, just not the book itself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Romantic Fantasy: This Is How You Lose The Time War (Amal El-Mohtar, Max Gladstone)**\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nThis was an incredible book. It took me a while to get into it I think because the prose and the structure of the book took some getting used to but oh my when I finished it I was so annoyed it wasn’t longer. The relationship was simply beautiful and, although it annoyed me initially, I was so glad the book didn’t focus on all of the background factions or the war or anything because it left the focus entirely on the relationship. Definitely one of my favourite reads of this card and highly recommended. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Big Dumb Object: The Three Body Problem (Cixin Liu)**\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nThis was just alright for me, had some interesting ideas but large portions of the book I struggled to maintain interest in. I didn’t really connect with a lot of the characters in a way that made me want to keep reading about them. I’ve heard the next few entries are improvements on this so they will remain on my TBR. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel with a magical pet: The Empress of Salt and Fortune (Nghi Vo)** \n\nRating: 3/5\n\nI’ll be honest I can’t remember a lot of what happens in this story; there have been so many books between reading this and now. I do remember enjoying it and hoping it would be a bit longer, and I do remember liking the way the story was told. It’s actually on my TBR to read again so I can remind myself about everything in it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Audiobook: The Shadow Rising (Robert Jordan)** \n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nI actually listened to the whole of Wheel of Time throughout 2020 and couldn’t decide which to use for this square so the fairest way was to use the first one that fell within the Bingo time. I can’t believe I had never experienced the Wheel of Time before now it was an incredible journey. Yes the series has some flaws and some difficult portions to get through but as a whole this has been placed high on my list of all time favourites and I actually have to thank Bingo because if I didn’t have other books to read to complete the card I would have jumped straight into rereading this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel with a number in the title: Slaughterhouse Five (Kurt Vonnegut Jr.)** \n\nRating: 4/5\n\nI loved this book although it did take me a while to get into it, once I did I couldn’t put it down. I loved the non-linear writing style, the ideas presented and how they were dealt with and how personal the writing came across. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel featuring politics: Jade City (Fonda Lee)** \n\nRating: 5/5\n\nOn paper this book had everything I wanted in a novel and more. Thankfully it delivered on every promise and more, definitely one the best novels I’ve read this year and Jade War has been moved right up to the top of my TBR. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Novel by a Candian author: Children of Earth and Sky (Guy Gavriel Kay)**\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThe only reason I wouldn’t give this 5/5 is purely because of how hard I found it to get into. The prose, albeit beautiful, was difficult for me to get used to but once I did that was me fully immersed. I’ve heard that this isn’t Kay’s best book either so I can’t wait to read the rest of their work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Feminist Novel: The Handmaid’s Tale (Margaret Atwood)**\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nI absolutely loved this book, everything felt so visceral in it and Atwood did a great job of bringing the reader into the world. The ideas and how they relate to the world now made me challenge myself and consider perspectives I had previously been aware of but hadn’t spent a lot of time contemplating, a fantastic novel through and through.",

My favoirite series by far Is Kingkiller Chronicles, I really like the Idea of a badass protagonist and loved the magic system.\n\n 2. The blade Itself, I like how \"realistic\" It Is Idk how to explain It, I loved It.\n\n3. The Witcher series, I really like Geralt the badass and all the monsters and world building.\n\n4. After that Is farseer which I just finished and It was pretty good but for me It lacked action or maybe Its just not my style..\n \nI also really liked American gods, and I read the first mistborn book and didn't like It at all, It felt directed for young adults.\n\nI was thinking of reading next Gentlemen Bastards, I also put my eyes on Circe, Broken Empire, The old kingdom chronicle, The grisha, Ninth house.\n\nWhat would you guys suggest me to read next? I wanna hear you opinions. Thanks a lot!",

Is their any reason I should at all be rooting for the survival of the Mage Order/School? Tissaia, Stregobor, and the other higher ups are all assholes with no morality. Like seriously, they seem more evil than Nilfgaard. This show is starting to make me understand why Radovid in the third game hates mages so much.\n\nAll the mage order seems to do is ruin the lives of little girls, advise kings (which literally anyone else could do), and pleasure themselves with their magic powers. What is the point of them surviving? Why should I give a shit about them? This really ruined the battle in the final episode for me.",

Now, I know it’s not straight up plagiarism, but the characters are pretty similar. And the stories are vastly different but you can’t deny Andrzej Sapkowski did take inspiration from it.\n\nAnd now I find out that he has another series called ‘The Eternal Champion’ which has quite a few similar aspects to a popular manga series called ‘Attack on Titan,’ which the author of said series has admitted to taking inspiration from. \n\nIt just really saddens me seeing all of these series that were inspired by his works getting more recognition than him. He is a great storyteller and more people should read his books",

They'll meet Nivellen (\"A Grain of Truth\") either episode 1 or 2. Then they'll go and train in Kaer Morhen the next 2-3 episodes. We'll meet Vesemir & the other witchers, have a flashback to Trial of the Grasses, some fun monster hunting and probably a visit from Triss, like in the books. Geralt, Triss and Ciri will then leave to Melitele's temple \\~ in episode 5, where they'll hang with Yarpen Zigrin and his band. They then reach the temple.\n* **2nd thread:** Yennefer and the fallout from Sodden Hill. I believe this will mostly be original content to flesh out the season and future major players, like Francesca, Tissaia & co. We know they're expanding Filavandrel, so I believe we will have a major Scoia'tael introduction in these first few episodes. Probably some Lodge set up as well. Hopefully she'll meet Jaskier somewhere so we can have some fun banter. Probably around episode 4-5, I'd guess, so they can set up Rience and Yenna's battle with the little bastard. They'll then join and meet Geralt and Ciri at Ellander.\n\n**Episodes 6-7**\n\n* **1st thread:** Geralt meets up with Jaskier after leaving Ciri, and they start hunting Rience. They'll probably meet Dijkstra when they reach Oxenfurt, as well as Codhringer and Fen. Alas, we don't seem to be getting Shani this season/series. I'd guess episode 7 ends with the Michelet brother fight, Philippa showing up for some ass kicking, and Geralt wanting to return to Ciri.\n* **2nd thread:** Yenna + Ciri + Mother Nenneke hashing it out in Ellander. Probably lifted straight from the books. With some luck we get a version of \"The Voice of Reason\", with no Geralt but with badass Nenneke.\n\n**Episode 8**\n\n* This is where it gets tricky. I'd say there's a 50/50 chance the season actually ends in Oxenfurt, with Geralt wanting to go back to Ciri, and Ciri leaving Ellander with Yennefer. The other option is Oxenfurt in episode 7, and the Gors Velen part of Time of Contempt in episode 8. So we have Ciri, Geralt and Yennefer together as a family for the first time. Season ends with Ciri running from the Wild Hunt.\n\nOf course sprinkled throughout we'll have other stuff. I believe they'll expand on Cahir and Fringilla's Nilfgaard plot somewhere. We'll also meet all the Kings and Queens when they meet up to discuss the War, Cintra's demise and Ciri. We will of course have copious flashbacks, to Duny and Pavetta, as well as Falka's rebellion. How those will tie in is anyone's guess.\n\n*\\~ Edit: just remembered Istredd. Don't know how \"A Shard of Ice\" could factor into this season, but it would a hell of a short story to adapt. \\~*\n\nBut that's just my take!

I believe in season 2 we'll have two main threads, which will converge in the middle, only to separate and tie together again at the end.\n\n***\\~ SPOILERS FOR WITCHER BOOKS \\~***\n\n**Episodes 1-4**\n\n* **1st thread:** Geralt's adventures with Ciri. They'll meet Nivellen (\"A Grain of Truth\") either episode 1 or 2. Then they'll go and train in Kaer Morhen the next 2-3 episodes. We'll meet Vesemir & the other witchers, have a flashback to Trial of the Grasses, some fun monster hunting and probably a visit from Triss, like in the books. Geralt, Triss and Ciri will then leave to Melitele's temple \\~ in episode 5, where they'll hang with Yarpen Zigrin and his band. They then reach the temple.\n* **2nd thread:** Yennefer and the fallout from Sodden Hill. I believe this will mostly be original content to flesh out the season and future major players, like Francesca, Tissaia & co. We know they're expanding Filavandrel, so I believe we will have a major Scoia'tael introduction in these first few episodes. Probably some Lodge set up as well. Hopefully she'll meet Jaskier somewhere so we can have some fun banter. Probably around episode 4-5, I'd guess, so they can set up Rience and Yenna's battle with the little bastard. They'll then join and meet Geralt and Ciri at Ellander.\n\n**Episodes 6-7**\n\n* **1st thread:** Geralt meets up with Jaskier after leaving Ciri, and they start hunting Rience. They'll probably meet Dijkstra when they reach Oxenfurt, as well as Codhringer and Fen. Alas, we don't seem to be getting Shani this season/series. I'd guess episode 7 ends with the Michelet brother fight, Philippa showing up for some ass kicking, and Geralt wanting to return to Ciri.\n* **2nd thread:** Yenna + Ciri + Mother Nenneke hashing it out in Ellander. Probably lifted straight from the books. With some luck we get a version of \"The Voice of Reason\", with no Geralt but with badass Nenneke.\n\n**Episode 8**\n\n* This is where it gets tricky.

        "body": "I just saw a video calling Halo the best game/series ever, and I gotta say... wow. The game has super clunky gunplay, the story is godawful, Master Chief is an emotionless robot, as are all the other characters. In Halo 3 everyone talks about Johnson dying, and honestly I think that’s the only thing that made me sad in the game. I don’t give a shit about Cortana, she was cool in the later games (meaning 2 and 3) but for godssake let her die already. \n\nAnother game this applies to is KOTOR. That game actually does have quite a good story, and some really cool things you can do, but my god, even for 2003 is the gameplay complete shit. I get what they were going for but Bioware failed horribly at trying to make a (i guess) turn-based RPG. Same thing with all the Mass Effects except 2. Thankfully Mass Effect isn’t turn based but 1 and 3 have horrendous gameplay. Even writing this now, I think that I only liked ME2 because of its story and interesting departure from ME1. That Collector scene on Horizon felt like a fever dream, as did the Human Reaper, and it was fantastic.\n\nAnd finally, though this might be less nostalgia and more hype, The Witcher 3 is only good for its story and in my opinion Gwent. It’s combat is literally hit hit dodge, except with all of the strategy and timing taken away and instead you can just use whirl and destroy everyone and everything. And regarding its story actually, it butchers the relationship between Ciri and Yen. I get that Ciri’s not a bandit anymore and not an edgy teen, but at least be consistent with it. You can’t be like “Well it’s been 5 years so she’s had time to think on her actions” and then still be hostile towards Yen like how she was towards the end of the books, but absolutely dote on Geralt. Hell, Yennefer was much kinder to Ciri than Geralt ever was (arguably).",

I’m guessing I’m missing other examples, but where did this originate?\n\nIs it perhaps an allusion to the “lone wolf” stereotype of MCs of fantasy novels often being some sort of social outcast/pariah/other?",

        "body": "Just passing some time watching a Booktube video of \"Favorite Fictional Friendships.\" The choices are: 1) Darrow and Sevro (Red Rising); 2) Bridge Four (The Stormlight Archive); 3) Geralt and Dandelion (The Witcher); 4) Geralt and Milva (The Witcher); 5) Hawkeye and Mustang (Fullmetal Alchemist). I have to give the Booktuber credit for not focusing on the Usual Suspects, and for including two friendships between male & female characters on the list.\n\nThe Usual Suspects appear in the Comments section: Fitz and the Fool, Ender and Bean, Harry and Ron, Frodo and Sam, Legolas and Gimli, Wax and Wayne, Locke and Jean, Royce and Hadrian, Fitz and Nighteyes, Drizzt and Bruenor, Falcio and Brasti and Kest, Crowley and Aziraphale, Kvothe and Bast, Dresden and Michael. Old-school friendships like Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser and Rand/Mat/Perrin went unmentioned, but I couldn't help thinking of them. Friendships are a staple in the fantasy genre, to be sure, and they're wonderful to read about, but I couldn't help feeling a bit sad after a while, at what *wasn't* there. Friendships between women were entirely absent from the Booktuber's list, and barely given a nod in the comments.\n\nI can only think of a couple of female friendships in the genre that are truly *iconic* on the level of Frodo and Sam or Locke and Jean: Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg (Discworld) and Rowan and Bel (The Steerswoman). They're the only joined-at-the-heart female duos who have ventures over multiple books, as opposed to trilogies/series that tell one continuous story.\n\nAlso disheartening: I've finished a number of books in 2021 that I've enjoyed and even outright loved -- *The Kingdom of Back, A Dance with Fate, Rhythm of War, Unnatural Magic, The Blue Rose, The Once and Future Witches,* and *The Bone Ships;* I also need to count *Beautiful* and *The Blade Itself*, which I finished on audiobook. I'm currently reading *Hall of Smoke, The Shadow of the Fox,* and *Prince of Dogs*. All of these books, with the possible exception of *The Blade Itself*, have interesting and complex female characters at the center of the story. But only ONE of them -- *The Once and Future Witches* \\-- showcases any kind of positive bond between women. While female characters may share more scenes in *Rhythm of War* than in any Sanderson book I've read thus far, I still don't see two women enjoying anything like a *friendship* in it. (*Dawnshard* surpasses *RoW* where this aspect is concerned.)\n\nIt's true that you can find friendships between women in fantasy, if you look hard enough. (*Book of the Ancestor, The Spiritwalker Trilogy, The Shadow Campaigns, Priory of the Orange Tree,* and *Legends of the First Empire* are standouts, and I especially love Jane/Katherine in *Deathless Divide*, Vintage/Noon in *The Ninth Rain*, and the bonds in *Uprooted and Spinning Silver*) But why, even with all the inroads women have made in the genre, both as authors and as characters, do friendships between female characters remain comparatively rare, especially in the most popular books/series?",

        "body": "Okay, so I embarked upon this book (and series) for two reasons:\n\n1. **The covers**. GUYS. These book covers are magnificent. Seriously, go check [them](https://www.facebook.com/PhilipCQuaintrell/photos/a.1099850740047802/4166570483375797/) out.\n2. Because the **final book in the series is releasing at the end of May**.\n\nMy conclusion (so far)? **This is a series that deserves significantly more attention**.\n\nI have to commend Quaintrell for putting together such a **well-crafted Epic Fantasy**. While there is nothing groundbreaking here in terms of plot or world-building, the level of execution is *so* impressive, especially for a debut work. This is a complex plot that could have *easily* become a convoluted mess in the hands of a less-skilled writer, but I was so happy with the way Quaintrell brought everything together by the end. I started Book 2 immediately.\n\nAside from that, I also have to comment on the character work. I was **genuinely invested in each of the POV's**, and I loved that they all felt so distinct. Their motivations and decisions made sense, and even when I disagreed with them I wanted to know what would happen next. Again, so impressive for a young author.\n\nMy only real complaint involves some grammar/wording issues that are evidence of **poor (or lack of) professional editing**, which makes sense considering this is self-published. Don't let that stop you from reading this, though - especially if you are a Sanderson or Jordan fan. If the following books are anywhere near as good as this one was (and Goodreads, at least, suggest they [are](https://www.goodreads.com/series/277263)), **this has the makings of one of the better Epic Fantasy sagas this decade**.\n\n**TL;DR:** While not groundbreaking, **Rise of the Ranger** is a very well-executed and entertaining Epic Fantasy. \n\n[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Ranger-Echoes-Fate-Book-ebook/dp/B072BL3C3C/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=rise+of+ranger&qid=1618839129&sr=8-3) (available on Kindle Unlimited!)\n\n[Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/Rise-of-the-Ranger-Audiobook/B078XLHCZH?qid=1618839174&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=6EPRGAGGFW59H1T051B3)\n\n[Author Website](https://www.philipcquaintrell.com/)",

        "body": "I’ve veered wildly off my bingo plan only a few weeks in, but I’m enjoying myself. To keep myself loosely on track, I’m going to try doing mini-reviews every time I hit five or so books that *could* qualify for bingo, even if not all of them can fit on the same card. Let me know if there’s something else you’d like to see in this format—I’m happy to play around.\n\n**The Unspoken Name**, A.K. Larkwood\n\nRating: 3.75/5 stars\n\nBingo squares: New to You Author, (update) Book Club/ Readalong (Hugos Readalong), Debut author (HM- [here’s her AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/fge1fo/im_a_k_larkwood_author_of_the_unspoken_name_ask/)), Chapter Titles (with the new clarification, this is not hard mode because 3 out of 27 chapters are one-word titles)\n\nContent warnings: >!gore (torture, blood sacrifice, and self-mutilation for magical purposes)!<\n\nThis is a vivid linked-worlds adventure story about an orc warrior, lots of mages powered by the divine, old gods, collapsing worlds, blood sacrifice, and treasure hunting. The first third of this book felt *so* slow to me, but I’m glad I kept going. The story really comes into its own when Csorwe is a young adult venturing through different worlds linked by magical gates and trying to decide her own loyalties. There’s a very slow-burn sapphic romance, but it’s far from the focus of the story—I’d pin this as being a lot more of a multi-POV adventure story, and I’m looking forward to the sequel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fireheart Tiger**, Aliette de Bodard\n\nRating: 2.5/5 stars\n\nBingo squares: Set in Asia (HM), Published in 2021\n\nContent warnings: >!implied rape attempt, emotional abuse!<\n\nA fantastic setting for a mediocre love triangle. Bình Hải is a pre-colonial Vietnam setting, which isn’t something I’d seen before, and I love the vivid descriptions. The initial negotiation conversation is also good, with its political implications under every sentence as Thanh unfolds shades of meaning, but then the story collapses into a love triangle with one good/kind option (zero chemistry) and one cruel-but-charismatic option (loads of chemistry but also abuse) that make the conclusion boringly obvious. I’d been looking forward to this one for months but found it largely disappointing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Echo Wife**, Sarah Gailey\n\nRating: 4.5/5 stars\n\nBingo squares: First person, New to you, Published in 2021, Genre mashup (SF/ thriller or horror)\n\nContent warnings: So, so many. >!Medical gore and dehumanization, accounts of domestic abuse, murder.!< Some moments are darkly funny, but this is an intense read.\n\nDefinitely my favorite bingo read so far, and I’m not normally interested in thrillers at all. There’s a domestic relationship angle, but this is primarily an SFF thriller asking \"who gets to be a person?\" wrapped in a character study about how people excuse scientific atrocities. Gailey has an incredible gift for controlling tension, releasing one piece of information at a time to complicate the picture that Evelyn is painting. When Evelyn seems like too much of a monster, we learn more about her past; when we start to sympathize with her, we see more of her work and her bottomless contempt for her ex-husband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shadow and Bone**, Leigh Bardugo\n\nRating: 3/5 stars\n\nBingo squares: Witches (HM), Debut author\n\nContent warnings: Typical fantasy genre violence, >!a sudden attack on civilians!<\n\n**Shadow and Bone** is a middle-of-the-road YA fantasy with some good passages that didn’t inspire me to read the rest of the trilogy. Reading Bardugo’s first book from 2012 soon after reading **Ninth House**, which came out in 2019, was a great reminder of how much authors can grow in just a few years. The magic is interesting but not explored in detail (the way it’s supposed to resemble science didn’t click for me until Six of Crows), the dialogue is too contemporary-American in tone, there’s a tedious Not Like Other Girls undercurrent to character interactions, and I don’t care for the love triangle elements. And yet, I really enjoyed the last third or so of the book, which has a great wilderness journey and some more solid character work. If you like YA, this is a fine one, but it feels generic and bland until well past the halfway point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Six of Crows**, Leigh Bardugo\n\nRating: 4.25/5 stars\n\nBingo squares: Found family, Revenge-seeking character, \\_ of \\_\n\nContent warnings: >!Gore (there’s a sudden eye removal for torture/interrogation purposes in addition to plague corpses), heavy references to forced prostitution of teenagers as backstory (not graphic, but very present)!<\n\nInfinitely better than **Shadow and Bone**. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a heist novel with lots of alternating POVs. The characters are all vivid (if sometimes hard to believe as teenagers), the heist structure is well-explained, and Inej the stealthy acrobat/spy is an absolute book-stealer of a character. There are one or two small elements that didn’t work for me (one piece of backstory that had been built up as a big deal just didn’t land well, an incident where a character acted out of character because the plot needed it rather than because it felt natural), but overall I enjoyed myself and am already reading the sequel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome longer reviews for these and things I read pre-Bingo are on my Goodreads. I'm maintaining a [Read in 2021 shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/119502765-l?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read-in-2021).",

She just tries to hide her emotions, because she thinks of them as weakness. She had a really rough childhood. Which had as an effect for her not to be loved, so she loves Geralt and Ciri but can't show it, because she doesn't know how. In the end, she finally learns how, due to Geralt's and Ciri's love and affection. In the books, she has an entire character arc (which usually stays unseen or is not very appreciated, because she is the third main character, with Geralt and Ciri taking the lead, so we don't have much of her perspective). In the first books, she can be a little bit bitchy, not only with those around her but even with Geralt, but in the next books she starts to show emotions for Geralt and especially for Ciri. Also, everyone kinda envies her (that can be seen a lot in the books. It's even stated by some characters like: Ciri, Sabrina, Francesca) and they don't like her because of that. She seems like a bitch because she just doesn't give a fuck about what people think about her. So, she just stays herself and doesn't try to change.\n\nThat is not because she doesn't have feelings, but because she doesn't know how to show them or she is a afraid of opening up and getting neglected. Have you ever wondered how she felt when she woke up on her house in Vengeberg and saw that Geralt had left her, without saying a word. Friendly reminder: Geralt is the only character that Yennefer lets in her house. Even when she was with Istread she was the one going to his house.\n\nYen always wanted to become a mother but she couldn't, and her trying to restore her fertility is a major part of her character. Even when she met Geralt with the djinn in Rinde, it was because she wanted the djinn to restore her fertility. She didn't want to leave with Geralt, not just because she was not a quitter and very proud to flee. She didn't want to leave because she thought of it as her last desperate attempt, as a \"I accomplish that or I die\" ( that shows how much that affected her).\n\nCiri's love is the one that really changed her. In fact, Yennefer always saw Ciri as the daughter she never had, even from their time in Ellander. And we can realize that from when Ciri got hurt during their training she called her daughter and she was really depressed while Ciri was in bed. That can also indicate her emotional scars, she thought she hurt her daughter and that reminded her of her mother and how she abused her. Also, have you ever noticed that she always called Ciri her daughter, but does it in a regular basis only when Ciri calls her mother. That's because she never forced her feelings over Ciri and she just wanted to make sure Ciri feels the same way. \n\nShe is also afraid of redemption, that can be seen when Geralt and her were at the Thanned Coup. He expresses his feelings and she replies that she loves him too, but didn't tell him because she was afraid he wouldn't feel the same way.\n\nSomeone except Geralt and Ciri that played a great role  in her life is...Tissaia de Vries. Tissaia was the first person that believed in Yennefer and her capabilities, she also was the one that saved her. Tissaia was Yennefer's mentor and the mother figure that she needed. Thus, it made sense for Yen to admire her. Tissaia was described as a stern person which showed no feelings at all, even when she was comforting Yennefer she had a look without emotion and a cold and unfriendly attitude, which Yennefer adopted. That can be seen in the first meeting between her and Ciri. Ciri was jealous and wanted what Yennefer had, the only thing that she didn't want were her cold and stern violent eyes.\n\nI have heard a lot of people claiming that she is interested in power and can be greedy with it. No... just a big no. Firstly, Yennefer could have easily taken advantage of the situation with the lodge and she could even have as political affection to the Northern Kingdoms as a king if she played it well. And we all know that she could easily played it that way. But she didn't, she sacrificed everything to try to rescue Ciri. She could even do both, but that would need time and Yen wants to find Ciri immediately, because she wants her to be safe and sound as fast as possible.\n\nEven her bitchiness is just a wordplay. She has no intention of hurting Geralt or Ciri, she just expresses herself that way. For me personally, it's amusing to see them play with words like this. \n\nAll in all, she is a great and underrated character that, if you get to know her better and allow yourself to see things through her perspective, you will adore. I would like to add that I see in other series or books characters that have done a lot of crimes getting adored, even though they don't have a redemption arc, just because they where abused. That, made me sad because I thought that nobody appreciates her the way she deserves it.",

        "body": "Spoilers ahead!\n\nSo this chapter was a big more confusing then usual regarding these books.\n\n1) Why did Tissaia bring in Yen with Ciri to the \"meeting\". She seemed like a neutral person to me, yet she sort of sided with Vilgefortz(along with Triss, is that right?), who then betrayed her and started killing everybody. Also, what was that Ciri proficy thingy about? was she speaking about things that happened which other sorceresses, besides it seemed Phillipa, didn't know about?  \n\n\n2) What did Vilgefortz mean by the whole \" sky and peat\" thing. Sorry if I translated incorrectly, since my book isn't exactly in English thus I don't know how it translates. He sort of says to Geralt that you confused the sky with peats top side, where the night reflects that stars? I guess I never understood what that meant through out the entire chapter\n\n3) Also, that Kahir guy. Did he actually save Ciri from Cintra, if so, for what purpose(Tho don't answer if it's going to be explained in the future). The reason I ask is that in the Netflix show, he seemed like Hitler tbh lol, so I couldn't really envision him saving her. \n\n4) One more thing. Why did Phillipa never gave up the Nilfgaard mage who's name starts with R(sry not english books so idk how he's called) to Geralt? like she let him escape on purpose so Geralt wouldn't realize who he is working for or smth like that in BoE, but what is the reason? isn't he working for Nilfgaard, you know, both Phillipas and Geralts enemies? so why would she hide him from the Witcher?\n\nOn a side note, how did Vilgefortz beat Geralt, if in the show he couldn't even beat Kahir?",

        "body": "I did. And the title is probably enough to have you good peopel comment and discuss this, but I'm going to express myself here just in case anyone is interested in reading me.\n\n# The Power of Less, and Impact\n\nThe first two books of the Witcher series are comprised of short stories, and each one has a point. Each one has a theme. The short stories work this theme, and by the end, leave us with a pretty impactful experience that, if inclined to thought, provokes you into thinking about the story, and what it's trying to tell you through the narrative.\n\nI love this about the first two books. It's a lot like what many fairty tales (the original ones) do, and I admire Sapkowski for this.\n\nUnfortunately, after Sword of Destiny, this impactful narrative just fades out, and we start reading a story that, in my opinion, prolongs itself too much, and loses practically all of its impact. Don't get me wrong, I like it. But the expeience is much flatter than what I was given with the first books.\n\n# Slow Does Not Necessarily Mean Scenic\n\nI'm sure many people will disagree with this, but I truly think that the books that come after Sword of Destiny are unnecesarily slow. Sapkowski stops telling us the main story in order to follow some side characters in side stories and, I for one, didn't really care for almost all of them.\n\nI only ever liked one of these meanderings, and even then, only the very last part. I can't remember which book, but it's the part when Dijkstra meets with King Thiessen. The first part of that chapter was a history lesson that could have easily been skipped. Thankfully, I war rewarded for trudging through thsi marsh with a character I loved (Thiessen), but it was too little, too late. And the worst part? >!Thiessen is barely ever in the spotlight again after that.!<\n\n# Geralt's Arc is...Unsatisfactory\n\nIs it just me, or does Gerlt go from being an admirable character who is willing to follow his own principles, yet flexible enough to learn along the way to become a better person, to a mindless dad just chasing his daughter around?\n\nI get that he \"comes to grips\" witht he concept of destiny that *is* prevalent and real in his world. But it's one thing to accept your place in a tapestry of destiny, and it's another to become a fanatic. I felt disappointed watching Geralt go from a flawed, yet admirable character (except where Yeneffer's concerned), to a crazed, brat-chasing \"somebody.\"\n\n# That's It\n\nDon't get me wrong. I liked the series, and am very glad I read it. They're not bad books at all. I just wish I had more of what I was given in the beginning.\n\nWhat are your thought, though?",

        "title": "Did You Like The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny More Than the Rest of the Series?",
        "body": "I did. And the title is probably enough to have you good peopel comment and discuss this, but I'm going to express myself here just in case anyone is interested in reading me.\n\n# The Power of Less, and Impact\n\nThe first two books of the Witcher series are comprised of short stories, and each one has a point. Each one has a theme. The short stories work this theme, and by the end, leave us with a pretty impactful experience that, if inclined to thought, provokes you into thinking about the story, and what it's trying to tell you through the narrative.\n\nI love this about the first two books. It's a lot like what many fairty tales (the original ones) do, and I admire Sapkowski for this.\n\nUnfortunately, after Sword of Destiny, this impactful narrative just fades out, and we start reading a story that, in my opinion, prolongs itself too much, and loses practically all of its impact. Don't get me wrong, I like it. But the expeience is much flatter than what I was given with the first books.\n\n# Slow Does Not Necessarily Mean Scenic\n\nI'm sure many people will disagree with this, but I truly think that the books that come after Sword of Destiny are unnecesarily slow. Sapkowski stops telling us the main story in order to follow some side characters in side stories and, I for one, didn't really care for almost all of them.\n\nI only ever liked one of these meanderings, and even then, only the very last part. I can't remember which book, but it's the part when Dijkstra meets with King Thiessen. The first part of that chapter was a history lesson that could have easily been skipped. Thankfully, I war rewarded for trudging through thsi marsh with a character I loved (Thiessen), but it was too little, too late. And the worst part? >!Thiessen is barely ever in the spotlight again after that.!<\n\n# Geralt's Arc is...Unsatisfactory\n\nIs it just me, or does Gerlt go from being an admirable character who is willing to follow his own principles, yet flexible enough to learn along the way to become a better person, to a mindless dad just chasing his daughter around?\n\nI get that he \"comes to grips\" witht he concept of destiny that *is* prevalent and real in his world. But it's one thing to accept your place in a tapestry of destiny, and it's another to become a fanatic. I felt disappointed watching Geralt go from a flawed, yet admirable character (except where Yeneffer's concerned), to a crazed, brat-chasing \"somebody.\"\n\n# That's It\n\nDon't get me wrong. I liked the series, and am very glad I read it. They're not bad books at all. I just wish I had more of what I was given in the beginning.\n\nWhat are your thought, though?",

        "title": "My review of The Blacktongue Thief",
        "body": "Every once in a while a book comes out that blows me away.\n\nThis is no easy feat, I’ve been reading prolifically since I was about seven. Now nearly thirty years later, I’d say I’ve read more than most. It’s not so easy to topple me from my reading perch.\n\nTo be blown away not only requires a fantastic story, superb plotting, exciting characters, and interesting world building - it also needs to be different, to push boundaries, to feel new.\n\nThe blacktongue Thief does this and more. For me, it excels in all areas. \n\nFirstly, if we think of world building, imagine Lord of the Rings, but instead of orcs there are goblins, and instead of Gandalf there is a witch (or two), and instead of noble Aragorn there is a thief (with a bit of magic) who worships the God of Mischief....\n\nso not very like Lord of the Rings at all... except...\n\nThe world is epic, just like Middle-Earth. There are several human kingdoms, all of which are distinct from the other, and different to the usual fantasy kingdom cultural set up. And just as Tolkien enjoyed creating languages, Christopher Buehlman has invented his own languages too - some of which involves cursing, some of which is poetry and song. There is a journey. A quest. There is love and magic. \n\nI don’t write spoilery reviews, but just to set up the world (using content from only the first few chapters) this is a land scarred by war. Men and women both fought against the goblins and very few survived. The horses are nearly all dead, due to a plague caused by goblin magic. However, another war is looming and the human kingdoms are no longer aligned. \n\nKinch is a thief who owes a debt to his guild. He has more magic than most realise, though not as much as he would like. He loves money, the smell of it, the taste. He isn’t a hero. He doesn’t always do the right thing, and yet he is certainly a character worthy of following. \n\nHis travelling companion is Galva, owner of a large and dangerous bird known as a corvid. She is loyal and honourable. The opposite in many ways to Kinch, and yet this makes for an interesting dynamic. \n\nThe set up feels like many a buddy movie/ book. The Hound and Arya. Geralt of Rivia and Jaskier. This duo really excels like the duo’s I’ve mentioned. They bounce off each other, sometimes in a way of deep friendship, other times they made me laugh out loud. If anybody has read the bathtub scene, they will know what I mean. \n\nThe prose is masterful. Kinch is hilarious, and somehow Christopher Buehlman manages to keep his voice entertaining. I haven’t read a character so witty since Tyrion Lannister. However, Tyrion’s chapters were scattered within a multi-POV book. It’s difficult to tire of a voice when they don’t last for long. Kinch is able to be hilarious throughout the novel - his humour moving from dry wit, lurid cursing, and stream-of-consciousness style stories. \n\nIn terms of the magic system, it is Kinch who tells us what is going on and how the world operates. Don’t expect any Sanderson-style detailed explanations though. You will learn how the magic works bit by bit. On a need to know basis, you might say. That isn’t to say the system is haphazard or soft - it isn’t. There are strict rules, things you must remember, and layers will be added to the rules as the story progresses. \n\nI would add this is a character driven story. The plot at times meanders, we go places that sometimes seem to have little relevance (they always matter in the end), we pick up extra characters, only to loose them a while later. I loved that about this book, because it drew me in. There is a whole chapter dedicated to a card game called Towers - which by the way somebody actually needs to make.\n\nI left the book wanting to drink wine in Ispanthia, to play a game of Towers in a tavern in Edth. I want to avoid Molrova at all costs.\n\nIn short, I want the sequel.\n\nIf anybody wants to read more reviews from me go to my website at www.shaunalawless.com and go to The Mythology Queen blog! I’d love to hear what you thought of my review or the book itself!",

        "body": "I saw a lot of people, mostly on Wiedzmin subreddit, considering Vilgefortz a one-dimensional character, with his only good moments in Times of Contempt, and although I am not going to argue with anyone about their own perceptions, that still baffles me.\n\nVilgefortz, just like every other character in the series, seems to me a doppelganger. Mainly of Geralt, of course, as he himself hints at Thanedd, but also of Yen and Avallac'h, and in a way of Bonhart. Doppelganger, because he is a twisted/different version of a similar \"upbringing\", sharing a similar beginning. He himself makes the connections with Geralt. Bonhart being a creepy Geralt version (side by side, both in looks, skills and \"father figure\" for Ciri) makes him also a different Vilg (just like Geralt refused the idea of becoming a mage and \"tried\", to quote Jaskier, to be a good person, Bonhart never had the chance of becoming a mage, but still prospered in a similar way to Vilgefortz, with a similar, \"fighter\" past of Vilg). Avallac'h is a fox, to quote Iharraquax, who tries to convince Ciri to help him. Vilg is his double in the sense he preys in her, like a bat or a vampire. That, too, makes room for a comparison to Regis. Regis is, by every logic, a serial killer/murderer/madman (if we were reasoning in human, contemporary, real-life terms) who, although these things still are present in his nature and instincts, forces himself on a life (or *unlife*) of moral righteousness and atonement. Vilg doesn't care for that and answers to his past traumas in a realistic way, included his rant when the Hen Ichaer seems to be finally in his grasp (before Ciri is saved by the bell...literally).\n\nThat's why, in my opinion, accusing him of being a one-dimensional villain (and Sapkowski of having written a dumb character, after the exploit of ToC), fails to understand not just his character, but the underground themes of the series. It would be like acknowledging Yen's quest for motherhood, but never realizing a similar, implicit quest (fulfilled, to an extent) in Tissaia's case. Incidentally, the relationship showed on Netflix between Yen and Tissaia is proof of a good understanding by the showrunners. Failing her daughters at Thanedd (letting them fall to internecine war and the quest for power, or letting them being wounded) always seemed to me the underground reason for her suicide, something the show is probably going to implement, together with the added Tissaia/Vilg subplot and consequences. Which links my past rants with my appreciation, until now, of the Vilg's depiction on Netflix.\n\nIn conclusion, and just to make two examples from other series, saying Vilg is monothematic, one-dimensional or dumbed down after ToC is very much like (in my opinion, at least) saying Black Dow has no meaning or depth in \"First Law\", whereas he is the counterpart (again) to Logen (a truly \"misunderstood\" guy vs someone who convinces himself to be a good person). Or, to express another part of Vilgefortz, Randall Flagg from \"The Dark Tower\": his actions seem over the top and sometimes he appears like an idiot, but when we implement in our consideration his (*their*) background(s) both the actions and the writing appear consistent, and the characters are, probably, better than ever. Simply because, although they lack a point of view, we can guess their mental processes and see them as *truly* tri-dimensional people, sometimes as antagonists/villains, some other times as alter ego of the main character, but twisted in dark way.\n\nIf you want, the way Artemis Entreri was to Drizzt.",

Now I don't mind a little implication of love making or kisses I guess but I do get quite disturbed by overly sexual descriptions and incest and all that.

Maybe Geralt of Rivia (The Witcher) could be part of it? I don't think he would be that useful, a tank would be more useful, but I can't think of whom. What did you think?\n\nTo make things more interesting, try to set up a party with characters that preferably have these two characteristics:\n\n1- Being from a medieval fantasy world.\n\n2- The character must not be useless, nor very powerful.   \n\n\n(I was initially thinking of the Berserk world as the setting, but you can use other worlds)",

        "body": "I rewatched the season last night and it got me thinking. Jaskier generally comes across as a happy go-lucky 'lets be friends' from the outset, and 'Toss a coin' is just him doing his barding. But is it possible Jaskier sings it out of concern for the townspeople in Ep.2?\n\nWe see him extend friendship to Geralt *pretty damn hard* and get solidly rebuffed the entire time by someone who clearly wants nothing to do with people and it's not hard to see Geralt's shooing *anyone* away, not just the overly talkative bards, and in a pretty misanthropic way; most people who just want alone will at least tolerate the odd interaction when it's forced on them but Geralt utterly ignores 99% of everything Jaskier says, even direct questions and his willingness to save others morally isn't as readily obvious.\n\nHe then watches Geralt completely shrug off a 'minature cannonball' before effortlessly overpower a 'devil' and then emphatically separate himself from 'humans', condemn them, and demand that the elves recognise him as non-human if they mean to kill him.\n\nOn top of all this, Jaskier knows of Geralt's personal history and moniker The Butcher of Blaviken *and* that when asked, openly feels 'butcher' is more appropriate than White Wolf. And as a learned, literate travelling bard is almost guaranteed to know stories and rumours of Witchers 'going rogue' when they don't get paid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this combined adds subtext to the tavern scene. Jaskier is very aware the village are toying with the idea of not paying up and acutely aware that Geralt also knows this. He only has a *hunch* Geralt would take the loss and leave; but it's 100% in his presented character, history and racial identity to massacre the whole room without remorse as punishment. \n\nThe song isn't *just* to make sure his new buddy gets paid, it's to protect everyone in the room and they don't even know it.\n\nEven more so, he starts writing it *on the journey back*, meaning he might have been anticipating and worried about such an eventuality from the get go.",

This is why I'm asking for a recommendation if there is a series with a similar tone, characters, themes, etc. I would be very happy to find one! \n\nRecommend anything except The Lord of the Rings, The Dark Tower, Malazan's Book of the Fallen, The First Law Trilogy, and The Wheel of Time. I'm preparing to read them, but not Wheel of Time because this kind of doorstopper length simply scares me",

        "title": "[SPOILERS FOR THE BOOK & SHOW] I just finished reading the series. Here are my thoughts.",
        "body": "Firstly, I have only read the books and watched the show, so I cannot comment on the video games. Perhaps someone with knowledge of the games can lend their voice to the discussion. I understand that they are works of art. I would love to try my hand at them when the weather is poor this summer. \n\nI’ll jump in:\nMy first thought, right off the bat, was that I was disturbed at the role that Fringilla played in the TV series. It made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. I haven’t delved into the interviews to see why this major change was justified, but wouldn’t it make sense to elevate the status of someone like Stefan Skellen or Vattier de Rideaux to mastermind the Nilfgaard plot, seeing as they were major players in the war? Fringilla, let’s face it, isn’t a villain. She’s a minor pawn. I would go so far as to say she isn’t even an antihero. Her character is destroyed in the show. I am slightly astounded. \n\nFollowing that, Cahir!!!!! I have to use emphasis here because Cahir, a gentle and literally loving boy, is reduced to this villainous stereotype? It’s such lazy writing! It reminded me of Game of Thrones all over again. I was furious when I read the books and realized that Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach’s character was butchered on a scale very similar to Jon Snow’s character going from book to show. (I know many people don’t take Myer’s Briggs theory as gospel, but for argument’s sake, Cahir in the books is an ISFP—artistic, adventurous, in the show, he’s an ISTJ—logical, practical (actually Geralt’s personality type in the books!))\nI suppose the reasoning for this will be a more significant “twist” when he follows Geralt on his quest. I still think it’s stupid. \n\nI love the show, truly. I think it was brilliant. I love how it drew from video game animation (the scene where Geralt and Mousesack pull Pavetta out of her trance and the scene fades to black was brilliant!) However, it was exceptionally confusing. I know that it has already been criticized for this. I understand why they did it. The spiral of fate, Ouroboros, blah blah. They did, however, justify some lazy writing at the expense of shoddy storytelling. I hope, desperately hope, that they won’t rush the story like Game of Thrones did. The story is long and complex. The Nilfgaard plot alone is confusing for book readers, let alone show watchers. \n\nI think the most challenging part about the transition from book to show will be the incompatibility of resolution. Shows demand finality. There has to be some sort of moral. End of. The Witcher series doesn’t give us that. Destiny, whatever you make of that, closes in a very unsatisfying—to some—way. There are threads left untied. What happens to Triss? She was meant to die on the Hill, correct? Ciri’s fate, though interesting, leaves much to be desired. Her child is supposed to save the world? \n\nI wanted SO MUCH to see a Cahir/Ciri destiny link, I won’t lie, simply because we learned of his “wolf” family links. It could have been so compelling. Plus, Ciri deserved someone in her life who didn’t want to actively rape or sexually assault her. \n\nYet, the books leave much of that untouched. Yen and Geralt’s fate makes sense. I absolutely believe that it’s up to the reader’s interpretation of how that ending played out. I think the most compelling clue is Yen’s delirious flashback to when she tried to kill herself and was revived by Tissaia. It’s compelling because it parallels the passage where Ciri is saved by Ihuarraquax for the first time. \n\n“Why do you torture yourself? said the calm, pedantic voice of the enchantress, Tissaia de Vries. Why do you condemn yourself to suffering? It’s time you put an end to it!\nNo. I won’t give in.\nYou will not endure this. Do you know how you die from thirst? Any moment now you will lose your mind, and then it will be too late. Then you won’t be able to end it all.\nNo. I won’t give in. I will endure it.\nShe sheathed the dagger. She stood up, staggered and fell down. She stood up again, staggered and began to march.\nAbove her, high in the yellow sky, she saw a vulture.\nWhen she came to again, she couldn’t remember having fallen. She couldn’t remember how long she had been lying there. She looked up at the sky. Two more vultures had joined the first one wheeling above her. She didn’t have enough strength to get up.\nShe realised this was the end. She accepted it calmly. Almost with relief.\nSomething touched her.\nIt nudged her gently and cautiously on the shoulder. After such a long\nperiod of solitude, after so long surrounded by lifeless, motionless rocks, the touch made her jerk up, in spite of her exhaustion. It made her attempt to jump to her feet. Whatever had touched her snorted and sprang back, stamping its feet noisily.”\n\nObviously, Ciri survives this. \n\nAnd Yen’s “vision”: \n\n“She came to, groaning in pain. Pain shot through both her forearms and wrists. She groped involuntarily, felt the thick layers of bandage. She groaned again, dully, despairingly. Sorry that it wasn’t a dream. And sorry that she’d failed.\n‘You didn’t succeed,’ said Tissaia de Vries, sitting beside the bed.\nYennefer was thirsty. She wanted somebody to at least moisten her lips, which were covered in a sticky coating. But she didn’t ask. Her pride wouldn’t let her.\n‘You didn’t succeed,’ repeated Tissaia de Vries. ‘But not because you didn’t try hard. You cut well and deep. That’s why I am here with you. Had it only been silly games, had it been a foolish, irresponsible demonstration, I would have nothing but contempt for you. But you cut deeply. Purposefully.’\nYennefer looked at the ceiling vacantly.\n‘I shall take care of you, girl. Because I believe it’s worth it. And it’ll require a good deal of work, oh, but it will. I’ll not only have to straighten your spine and shoulder blade, but also heal your hands. When you slit your wrists you severed the tendons. And a sorceress’s hands are important instruments, Yennefer.’\nMoisture on her mouth. Water.\n‘You shall live,’ Tissaia’s voice was matter-of-fact, grave, stern even. ‘Your time has not yet come. When it does, you will recall this day.’\nYennefer greedily sucked the moisture from a stick wrapped in a wet bandage.\n‘I shall take care of you,’ Tissaia de Vries repeated, gently touching her hair. ‘And now ... We are alone here. Without witnesses. No one will see and I shan’t tell anyone. Weep, girl. Have a good cry. Weep your heart out for the last time. For later you won’t be able to. There isn’t a more hideous sight than a sorceress weeping.’\n\nOf course, Yen does recall this memory at a time when her life is in peril. There is that. There’s also the parallel of desperate thirst. Water. Life. Am I philosophizing? Yes, I know; Sapkowski said in a Russian interview that they’re dead. But authors do this on purpose. \n\nWater is a powerful motif in fiction, especially in Arthurian legend. The Grail, the endless quest for the Grail, which is alluded to at the end of tLotL, is obviously said to be the key to immortality. Ciri lands herself in Camelot, as a Witcher, seemingly in the same realm as Nimue and Condwiramurs (possibly?) and the Fisher King, as he is quite literally the figure in Arthurian legend who guards the Grail. I know that he’s depicted as human in the books. Still, I also think that’s loosely up to interpretation, as I believe there’s a huge opportunity to develop Condwiramurs and Nimue’s universe. \n\nAvalon is an island only accessible to sorcerers of superhuman abilities. Quite literally, Ciri would be one of the only people who could reach Geralt and Yen. Normal mages couldn’t. It would take someone who could bend spacetime. \n\nSpeaking of spacetime, what happened to the elves who were pursuing Ciri? That whole plot went kaboom. I really wanted to see that one play out. I suppose it was enough that she saw the spiral close? \n\nAnd Avallac'h? His plot was shattered. I thought his story was compelling. That was a let down. \n\nMy biggest question at the end was: is Philippa Nilfgaardian? When I did a Google search, I couldn’t find any information hinting at this, so forgive me if this has been discussed before. I’ve pulled from three passages. The first one is the very last glimpse we have of Philippa’s thoughts. They are, interestingly enough, of a fountain with carps. This fountain is mentioned repeatedly, and most compellingly, it is mentioned as part of the thematic “beginning and ending.” \n\nIf you’ll note, Philippa is martyred by being torn apart. One of the things they did was tear her breast off. Pretty compelling if you ask me. The “noble sacrifice” for the good of The Lodge? It’s interesting.\n\nVattier says that the fish contains “wisdom” that it doesn’t need. Philippa, at the last moment we see her, reflects on a time in which she futility grasps for knowledge and comes up empty. She also has a fleeting moment of compassion, one that obviously stems from the understanding that she will never be able to “grasp” Ciri. Ciri is like the Nilfgaardian carps. Elusive and unobtainable. \n\nPhilippa:\n\n“The bottom of the pool is made of a many-coloured mosaic, the tiles shimmering and seeming to move. The entire surface trembles, glimmering with light and shade. Carp and orfe flash by under lily leaves as large as plates, amidst green pond weed. The young girl’s large dark eyes reflect in the water, her long hair reaches down to the surface, floating on it.\nThe girl, forgetting about the whole world, runs her little hands among the stems of water lilies, and hangs over the edge of the pool surrounding the fountain. She would love to touch one of the small gold and red fishes. The fish swim up to the girl’s hands, they circle around her curiously, but they won’t let themselves be seized; they’re as elusive as apparitions, like the water itself. The dark-eyed girl’s fingers close on nothingness.\n‘Philippa!’\nIt’s her most favourite voice. In spite of that the little girl doesn’t react right away. She continues to look at the water, at the little fish, at the water lilies and at her own reflection.\n\n‘Philippa!’”\n\n\nVattier:\n\n“He left the palace by the rear exit, which opened onto the gardens, and walked along a path lined with cypresses. He passed an ornamental pond, where a carp introduced by Emperor Torres was approaching the venerable age of a hundred and thirty-two years, as testified by a golden commemorative medal attached to the gills of the immense fish.\n\n[...] The ancient carp in the fishpond fanned the water with its pectoral fins. That beast, thought Vattier, must be very wise. But why does it need that wisdom? It’s still the same sludge and the same water lilies.”\n\nDuny:\n\n“They passed a pond, empty and melancholy. The ancient carp released by Emperor Torres had died two days earlier. I’ll release a new, young, strong, beautiful specimen, thought Emhyr var Emreis, I’ll order a medal with my likeness and the date to be attached to it. Vaesse deireadh aep eigean. Something has ended, something is beginning. It’s a new era. New times. A new life. So let there be a new carp too, dammit.\n\nThey stood by the pond, in the middle of which an artificial island rose out of the water, and on it a rock garden, a fountain and a marble sculpture.\n[...]\n‘Do you know what that figure depicts?’\nShe didn’t reply right away. ‘Yes, Your Imperial Majesty. It’s a pelican, which pecks its own breast open to feed its young on its blood. It is an allegory of noble sacrifice. And also—’\n\n‘I’m listening to you attentively.’\n‘—and also of great love.’\n‘Do you think—’ he turned her to face him and pursed his lips ‘—that a\ntorn-open breast hurts less because of that?’\n‘I don’t know ...’ she stammered. ‘Your Imperial Majesty ... I ...’\nHe took hold of her hand. He felt her shudder; the shudder ran along his\nhand, arm and shoulder.\n‘My father,’ he said, ‘was a great ruler, but never had a head for legends\nor myths, never had time for them. And always mixed them up. Whenever he brought me here, to the park, I remember it like yesterday, he always said that the sculpture shows a pelican rising from its ashes. Well, girl, at least smile when the emperor tells a funny story. Thank you. That’s much better. The thought that you aren’t glad to be walking here with me would be unpleasant to me. Look me in the eyes.’”\n\nI did appreciate the contrast between the ideals of “chivalric romance” and the Witcher code of beliefs. The ending, which highlights vividly the struggle that Geralt has manifested internally throughout the novels—the ideal that Renfri poses of “lesser evil” and fighting for a cause rather than abiding by neutrality, the one that Geralt embraces at the end of his life. Life doesn’t have happy endings, and nothing is ever black and white. People are good and bad, which is a concept that Geralt fundamentally struggles with as a Witcher. His profession disavows him the ability to see shades of grey. When he retires his title as a Witcher, when he goes to Rivia (a place he does not truly belong), he finds himself stuck in a murky identity, for he cannot, as the dwarves say, exist simply as Geralt. \n\nI could go on, but I’ve said enough already. I loved the series dearly. I think the use of the cycle of fate was brilliant. Truly, I admire Sapkowski. I am interested to see how the show will follow the books. It’s undoubtedly a complex narrative. I just hope they don’t oversimplify it.",

A topic that I haven't heard discussed elsewhere.)\n\nIn episode 7 at the Brotherhood meeting to discuss the war, someone accuses Fringilla of using banned magic including fire magic and necromancy in service to Nilfgard.\n\nThis is confirmed in episode 8 during the Battle of Sodden where Fringilla orders/forces conscripted mages self-sacrifice to create fireballs as well as the impenetrable mist. I think of this as a more extreme version of the Eel transformation we witness at Aretuza in episode 3.\n\nThe fireballs (at least 2) rattle many of the defender mages, who desert the battle. I wonder if they recognize the source of the fireballs and thus are scared of the lengths to which Nilfgard will go in service to the White Flame.\n\nWhen Yennifer channels fire, she absorbs the flames around the keep and refocuses it to burn the Nilfard army. I thought that Tissaia was going to get burnt to a crisp, but either she'd recovered enough from the Dimeritium attack to protect herself from the blast OR the Dimeritium was still absorbing all magic and thus shielded her from the blast. This is a bit of a callback to episode 2 when Yen absorbs and releases lightning and Tissaia deflects it. I wonder if this qualifies as a use of banned magic?\n\nNot sure if I have a particular point, but am curious if others agree / disagree or could expand on this idea that Yennifer is taking the bait so to speak from Fringilla in escalating the magical stakes in play.",

I've read the first book of short stories in the series, *The Last Wish*, and am about a quarter of the way into *Sword of Destiny* which is also a short story collection. While I enjoy spending time with the characters, there is one part of the books that notably hamper my enjoyment. The prose and dialogue isn't the best IMO. The dialogue and prose can feel very clunky, dry and heavy handed at times, characters can go into explain-o-vision a lot. The prose can feel the same way; it sometimes feels very exposition heavy and can go on long tangents. I'm not sure how much of a role the translation plays in making it come across this way but it's still a problem. I *want* to be able to get into the books more but so far it's really rubbing me the wrong way. Does it get better later in the series?",

While I enjoy spending time with the characters, there is one part of the books that notably hamper my enjoyment. The prose and dialogue isn't the best IMO. The dialogue and prose can feel very clunky, dry and heavy handed at times, characters can go into explain-o-vision a lot. The prose can feel the same way; it sometimes feels very exposition heavy and can go on long tangents. I'm not sure how much of a role the translation plays in making it come across this way but it's still a problem.

And I know Netflix can do less cuts considering they did Daredevil that has 5-15minute long no cut scenes. Of course it might be a bit harder with them needing weapons though...\n\n2. The bond between Geralt and Ciri. And seeing her train all her abilities.\n\n3. Better hair and eyes for Geralt... It looks terrible.\n\n4. Not hugely needed but more violence and gore. The dismemberment in the games is dope, but not required lol.\n\n5. Maybe more monsters? Assuming we’d get that anyway.\n\n6. Triss.",
