They share some common traits like being great warriors, tied with destiny & love to brood. Oh and plot armor is strong with them too. \n\nAragorn is the wise & experienced fighter who knows how to lead and has the makings of a king. Jon's journey from a steward to rising up the ranks to become a leader is fascinating. Geralt of ~~Rivia~~ has a tragic background that has mad him cynical but behind the brutish, strong exterior there lies a heart of a good man or one who often questions himself.\n\nWhich of these 3 do you like the best?  \n\nFor discussion purposes let's keep it to books.",

It gives me Black Moon Chronicles vibes. \n\nNever heard of this graphic novel, it's so obscure and most definitely underrated. Exactly what I like to find. If anyone has information about this series, I would be more than glad to learn it! \n\nOH Also the main character kinda looks like Geralt??",

Someone who can stand alongside the strongest and gruffest of fantasy lads - your Conans, your Gutses, your Geralts of Rivias, and what have you. A career kicker of asses. Kind of like a Red Sonja, but not quite *that*. And ideally one that doesn't include any sort of \"She may be strong, but she is still *only a woman*.\" nonsense in any shape or form.\n\nNow, here's the caveat: I'm looking for a book or series of books where such a lady is the *main character*. I love Brienne of Tarth as much as the next guy, but she's still a side character.\n\nI'll admit, I'm not as well-read as I'd like, so maybe there are some obvious ones out there that I've overlooked. Can anyone bring me my unicorn?\n\n*Or am I going to have to find a narwhal horn and one* very *unfortunate horse and make one myself?*\n\nEdit: What a vast and beautiful herd of unicorns I have been given! I will be sure to check out as many of these recommendations as I can manage, thank you all!",

        "title": "Charlotte Reads: The Surface Breaks by Louise O'Neill",
        "body": "CW for sexual assault, abuse and >!suicide!<\n\n**So What's It About?**  \n\n\n*Deep beneath the sea, off the cold Irish coast, Gaia is a young mermaid who dreams of freedom from her controlling father. On her first swim to the surface, she is drawn towards a human boy. She longs to join his carefree world, but how much will she have to sacrifice? What will it take for the little mermaid to find her voice? Hans Christian Andersen's original fairy tale is reimagined through a searing feminist lens, with the stunning, scalpel-sharp writing and world building that has won Louise her legions of devoted fans. A book with the darkest of undercurrents, full of rage and rallying cries: storytelling at its most spellbinding.*  \n\n\n**What I Thought**  \n\n\nIt’s easy to take shots at many classic fairy tales for their Lack of Girl Power and their Poor Female Role Models, and The Little Mermaid is no exception. *The Surface Breaks* is clearly written with the intent of reworking the original tale to bear a feminist message. I respect that initiative, but I have problems with almost every part of how O’Neill went about doing this.  \n\n\nOne of my biggest issues here is Gaia herself as a narrator. She begins the story as an incredibly cowed, self-hating girl who is powerless and indoctrinated by her culture’s sexism. That’s a pretty interesting place to start a character, in my opinion, but the problem is that O’Neill still uses her as the mouthpiece for dozens of astute observations about the injustice of sexism while she's had no character development. The mini-feminist monologues make absolutely no sense when she declares them and turns back around and silently trails her prince around his mansion, still desperate to win his love. The other problem is that she makes some of these observations specifically about the human world as opposed to the mermaid land, and there is no way that the character herself could know anything about lecherous Catholic priests or corporate harassment culture.  \n\n\nSome of these declarations feel rather misguided in my opinion, such as the time that a male character says women aren’t funny and Gaia reflects to herself that, *well, maybe women would be funny if they weren’t taught that they had to spend all their time laughing at men’s jokes.* This is such a bizarre take to me, because who on earth makes a feminist rebuttal to the Women Aren’t Funny schtick by agreeing that women are not, in fact, funny? The misguided messages carry over to the book’s handling of its themes of sexual violence and abuse; at one point the empowered, liberated Witch Queen - who acts as the main voice of morality and wisdom in the book - looks at Gaia with contempt and rhetorically asks her if she thinks she’s had it rough compared to the traumatized mermaids that the Witch Queen takes care of, concluding that Gaia doesn’t know anything about suffering. I am willing to doubt that a book should be marketed as a #MeToo read for teens when it legitimately ranks characters’ trauma and tells a girl who has been dealing with male violence her whole life to suck it up and be grateful that it wasn’t worse, especially after she has >!experienced an attempted rape mere pages before the conversation in question.!<  \n\n\nAnother utterly bizarre moment is when a woman gets called crazy and Gaia says the following:  \n\n\n*“She’s crazy, we used to say about maids in the kingdom who pursued certain mer-men relentlessly, crying and asking too many questions about where their man was and who he was with and if he had talked to any other maid that day. I’m beginning to wonder if, when we call a woman crazy, we should take a look at the man by her side and guess at what he has done to drive her to insanity.”*  \n\n\nWhat I THINK this is trying to say is that sometimes abusive men paint their victims as the crazy ones and there is a long history of pathologizing women’s suffering when it actually stems from outside sources so we should take a closer look at relationships before we simply accept that a woman is a hysterical bitch etc etc. But that’s not what this passage is actually saying, because the women described in the passage are the ones who are jealous and possessive and refuse to respect boundaries, right? So the inadvertent message here, to me, is that when a woman is actually jealous and possessive and refuses to respect boundaries, we should simply look at her male partner and figure out what he did to “drive her to it.” I sincerely hope that this is just writing that could have used more editing and not the intended message here.  \n\n\nI  really like the fundamental premise that a princess who grows up in a horribly sexist world decides that instalove with a handsome boy will save her from her troubles, but then she ultimately realizes her own power and saves herself. She realizes that the prince who sweeps you off your feet (tail?) is just a dream and no man is worth mutilating and silencing yourself for. That’s more or less what happens here, but, as I mentioned, a huge problem is that all of her learning and character development happens at the very end, in the final conversation with the Sea Witch, and she simply spends the rest of her time on land as Oliver’s devoted second shadow. It could have been so much more effective, especially if she had interacted with interesting women on the surface. As it is, there is just Oliver’s mother - a #girlboss facing the glass ceiling who is injudiciously hated by her son but hates Gaia just as much as Oliver hates her - and Gaia’s devoted servant who brews her gallons of homemade pain medicine and tends to her disintegrating feet every day.  \n\n\nAnd at the end of the day, Gaia's final realization about Oliver isn’t actually that she shouldn’t have tortured herself for his sake and pinned all of her hopes on a man she didn’t know - it’s that she was wrong in thinking men just cared about good looks - they actually like a girl who is smart and funny and has interesting opinions. Why is that the limit of how far the envelope is pushed for this part of the story - why is the lesson about Oliver still about how to win a man?  \n\n\nOf course, the story goes further in the last bit when she >!kills her father and tells her sisters to reclaim their power.!< >!She dedicates herself to the Sea Witch and her Salkas, determined to destroy the merman patriarchy.!< That’s definitely a much stronger ending, but I do question the efficacy of her >!transformation into a powerful new form being predicated on killing herself!<. I don’t know - I think different readers will feel differently about that bit.  \n\n\nThe book does its best to cover so many topics - eugenics, colonialism, gay rights, body image, corporate sexism, beauty standards, rape culture, abuse - but it ends up reducing each one to a surface level line or two in one of Gaia’s monologues, and none of it is handled with a great amount of nuance or depth. There were a few moments that felt so horribly on the nose to me, like when Gaia dismisses Zale’s sexist comment as “just mer-man talk - stop being so sensitive” or talks about the underwater kingdom being “made great again” by her father’s rule.  \n\n\nA few final notes - we never really explore the fact that Gaia >!chooses to kill Oliver’s girlfriend in order to save his life,!< and the fact that she is able to do so doesn’t even make sense. >!The Salkas specifically prey on human men for their misandrist revenge, so why would they accept a teenage girl in his place?!< Occasionally it is almost like the author forgets what setting she is writing in, both underwater on the surface. There are a few times that she describes the environment in the mermaid kingdom as “the air” and at one point Gaia inexplicably refers to a conch shell by its Latin name. I can’t fathom why Oliver and his family don’t attempt to teach Gaia sign language or how to read and write once they realize she is mute and illiterate. And on the point of that muteness…I ended up consulting with Goodreads because the day after Ceto >!cuts out Gaia’s tongue, she is able to happily eat a bowl of porridge. My friends’ estimates of the damage done by a cut-out tongue varied widely, but one and all agreed that you definitely wouldn’t be able to eat the next day. I KNOW that Ceto doesn’t use witch magic to heal her, either, because when the human doctor inspects her, everyone is horrified by the raw wound in her mouth!!!!!!< Finally, the writing is neutral overall but the mermaid characters switch between saying “okay” to each other and using pseudo-fantasy language. The strangest bit of writing to me is when Gaia imagines herself doing something difficult and, referring to herself, says *“it is heavy, is it not, little one?”*  \n\n\nI’ve now been talking about feminist mermaids for a long time. Too long, perhaps? In any case, this one really did not work for me at all. For books that I personally prefer in the YA Feminist Fairy Tale Genre, I would recommend [Stepsister](https://goodreads.com/book/show/41473840.Stepsister) and [Damsel](https://goodreads.com/book/show/36260155.Damsel).",

I would be perfectly happy to never see or hear her again, is it just me?\n\nEdit: finally got to actually finish the last episode of season 1, and I will give her badass scorched earth props. I may dislike her a bit less atm.

        "title": "[Essay] The pro-anarchism of the Dresden Files *Spoilers to Battle Ground*",
        "body": "The Dresden Files justifiably gets a lot of criticism over the years (reasons vary according to individual readers). I, on the other hand, love the books and they remain one of my all-time favorite series. Their action, humor, and world-building are things I've only found a few series like and it has been a major influence on my own writing.\n\nHowever, one area I'll always give the books credit is their handling of anarchist sentiment. What? You don't think it’s an anarchist series? Allow me to disagree. The books are incredibly anti-authority, hierarchy, and systems of control. This essay will prove this by showing his relationship to the White Council, police, and how Harry uses anarchist methods to undermine both in the name of justice. It will, necessarily, also contain spoilers up to the most recent book, Battle Ground, as well.\n\nI hope you enjoy!\n\n**WHAT IS ANARCHISM?**\n\nFor the purposes of this essay, we'll be going with the dictionary definition of anarchism: belief in the abolition of all government and the organization of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis without recourse to force or compulsion. This isn't to say that Harry isn't going to believe in certain undying principles, very much the opposite, but these have to be compelled through willingness to follow the rules out of a desire to do so rather than through fear of force. \n\nIt will come up repeatedly that the fear of punishment is something that flat out doesn't scare Harry and it is an attitude he encourages in his apprentices. Instead, Harry teaches his reasons for following principles like the Laws of Magic on the basis of them being good ideas. It also sets the stage for his everlasting hostility to authority and those who attempt to govern through the threat of force like the White Council and police.\n\n**HARRY AND THE WHITE COUNCIL**\n\nThe books are noir pastiches and while they moved toward high fantasy, they've never entirely shed their detective novel roots nor have they lost the unremitting hostility they have toward hierarchy. Our protagonist, Harry Dresden, begins the book as that classic staple of Les Miserable \"the innocent man hunted by a rabid cop.\" \n\nIn this case, Harry killed a dirty cop (his mentor, Justin, was a Warden despite being a warlock) in self-defense and has been harassed and pushed toward violence by Morgan for decades thereafter. Morgan won't just gun Harry down but wants to agitate him into giving him plausible deniability.\n\nInterestingly, enough, Harry believes passionately in the Laws of Magic and continually makes excuses for the White Council as well as their harsh methods even as he's a subject of their persecution. They even are willing to wage war on the Red Court when he starts a war on them, which buys them a lot of points with Harry.\n\nHowever, from the very beginning, the White Council's support of Harry is tepid at best and there are questions of turning him over to the Red Court for peace and Harry never improves in his opinion of their handling of the Laws of Magic's enforcement. We also slowly find out that Harry gets as much slack as he does due to nepotism. Literally, the only reason he wasn't executed was the Blackstaff was his grandfather and chose to adopt him after Justin's death.\n\nThe corruption and arrogance of the White Council goes beyond the \"few bad apples\" Harry initially suspects the Black Council to be but soon become clear to be entirely the ethos of the organization and how it relates to the rest of the world. They are heavy-handed, ruthless, and dismissive of any talents not powerful enough to be full wizards to the point of doing nothing to protect them against persecution by groups like the White Court. Harry, himself, is also the only wizard to actively defend the public against supernatural threats since most of them are covered by the Unseelie Accords.\n\nAt one point, Harry himself, becomes a Warden and the lover of their leader. This should have been a great moment for establishing the White Council's perspective as well as how Harry has been misjudged. Instead, it just further exposes Harry to the dark side of \"his\" supporters and after successfully stopping a Black Council agent that had been mind-controlling them all for years, they blame Morgan as well as elect another corrupt agent to their highest ranks.\n\nIt's no wonder that by the time Harry returns from his \"coma\" that he's lost all cachet with the younger Wardens, who have become radicalized true believers in the White Council's \"us against them\" mentality and every bit as eager to believe in Harry's guilt as Morgan. Truly, a sense of how Jim views authority can be shown with the kangaroo trial of Molly Carpenter where they come within inches of killing a holy knight of God's daughter even if it would destroy dozens of lives as well as alliances.\n\n**HARRY AND THE POLICE**\n\nHarry works with the police, which would normally disqualify him as an anarchist hero, but Butcher nicely lays the seeds for just how fragile and one-way his relationship with the Chicago PD really is. While they're willing to hire him as a consultant, he is a figure of derision and mockery even as he continually aids them against horrifying threats. No matter how many innocent lives Harry saves, the police view him as a necessary evil at best.\n\nMany longtime fans of the series believe I'm exaggerating because Harry's most permanent ally in the book is Lieutenant Karrin Murphy, who would right at home in a Law and Order spin-off. Surely as an honest cop, Karrin is a rebuttal that the Dresden Files are anti-authority. Indeed, it is the lengthy arc of said character that mirrors Dresden's own in reverse and helps show exactly where the series stands on its politics.\n\nFor me, the groundwork was laid in Fool Moon rather than Storm Front. While Storm Front established Harry was a rogue hated by the White Council's chief enforcer, Fool Moon shows just how easy it is to get the police to turn on Harry. Indeed, Karrin herself shows that allying with the police necessitates turning on Harry and she even blames him for not informing her of the supernatural goings on. As we later discover, telling the police about the supernatural doesn't help matters and most of them are either in the pocket of Marcone, the Formor Court, the Red Court, the White Court, or some combination thereof.\n\nIt's not too much of a spoiler to say Murphy's character arc is to have her attempt to follow the spirit of the law and protect the public, only to be slowly edged out of the police before being expelled entirely. By contrast, the originally seemingly decent cop, Rudolph, increases his wealth as well as influence within the CPD the more he becomes a contemptible corrupt weasel. \n\nButcher's depiction of the Chicago PD is actually fairly vicious and contrasts heavily on the romanticized view presented by television or other media. Marvel comics was incredibly hesitant to have Frank Castle AKA The Punisher ever kill a cop (even a dirty one). The first one he did was actually a SHIELD agent to avoid the controversy. However, Jim Butcher has Molly Carpenter openly confessing to doing so in Ghost Story as she explains that the Chicago PD was turning a blind eye to the trafficking in children by the Formor.\n\nPerhaps the most blatant example of how contemptible the police in the Dresden Files is when Rudolph accidentally kills Murphy in what is the most controversial moment of the series. He isn't even attempting to do it but it happens because of poor trigger discipline, cowardice, and incompetence. His misplaced sense of priorities in a crisis paints what is arguably the most realistic example of police malfeasance I've seen in urban fantasy yet.\n\nThe Dresden Files rarely gets into specifics regarding issues of profiling, minority abuse, and police brutality but the depiction of the police is largely one of a useless organization when not actively abetting the forces preying on the public. They have their moments, especially when the Formor turn on their allies and openly attack the city, but there's no indication the organization will change for the better. Especially as Rudolph planned to go after Harry and Murphy just hours before.\n\n**HARRY THE ANARCHIST**\n\nAll of this could just show the world is a crapsack one and that Harry isn't an anarchist, but I actually think Jim shows our protagonist using said philosophy's methods to undermine the traditional authority of his world. As early as Fool Moon with Kim Delaney and later reinforced with the death of Kirby in Turncoat, Harry realizes that keeping himself above his less powerful allies is a recipe for disaster. This actually lays the groundwork for Harry, not as a lone wolf soldier, but as the unlikely agitator and organizer of a large scale anarchist resistance.\n\nHarry's aid is important in helping lay the groundwork for the Paranet that protects practitioners against the supernatural forces that used to prey on them with impunity. He and Karrin recruit the Alphas, Order of the Large Cooking Pot, and others to start becoming a power block outside of traditional structures. Their alliances with individuals like Odin and Marcone are uneasy ones but show how grassroots organizations can become entangled with questionable forces in the name of larger goals.\n\nHarry attempts reform from within as well by helping create the Gray Council and working as a Warden among younger forces but these things are ultimately unsuccessful. The Blackstaff, his own grandfather, proves willing to murder him due to his hatred of Thomas Raith. Ramirez, his closest ally among the Wardens, turns on him as we've mentioned before. To quote Audre Lord, \"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.\"\n\nIronically, it is Harry's relationship forged with the Demifae that provides one of his largest advantage. Even Harry doesn't seem to realize that by simply acting with kindness and letting them organize under his protection, he had created a vast alliance of a overlooked minority. This proves decisive in the Battle of Chicago when the White Council and Unseelie Accords prove useless along with the US military.\n\nHarry is a champion of the people, and his army is the people against the Man.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe transformation of Harry into an anarchist and his fraying relationship with authority figures isn't something that happens overnight. Indeed, his relationship has many ups and downs before the final break between the White Council happens in Battle Ground. It is, coincidentally, also when his final break with the police is symbolically achieved with the death of Murphy.\n\nHarry is an unwilling anarchist in many ways because he wanted to work with the system and believe that the forces of order actually knew what they were doing. This despite the fact he was an innocent man persecuted for decades by hostile authority figures. However, in the end, he is forced to become a protective force for his community against not only the people outside the law like Marcone or the Red Court and Formor but also the people supposedly protecting the public from them.\n\n*“The Council has spoken,” he said, just as tiredly, and turned to go.*\n\n*“No,” I said.*\n\n*He paused. “What?”*\n\n*“No,” I said again, a little firmer. “The White Council has gotten to bully wizards for a long time, and they think they have the right. I say they don’t.”*\n\n*Ramirez tilted his head. “Don’t talk yourself into something I can’t ignore, Dresden.”*\n\n*I grimaced. “Carlos. I mean to live my life. You’ve cast me out, and you think that means I’m vulnerable. Maybe you ought to rethink that.”*",

        "body": "Many of you have probably forgotten about the upcoming new spin-off for the Netflix series. ***The Witcher: Blood Origin.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k40y291eu3d91.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ec282edd1ca99fc6e9f51b28949ef92fd46c4e\n\nTaking place thousands of years before the main series, Witcher: Blood Origin would follow a group of elves. Made up completely from original material, the project would have very little to do with Andrzej Sapkowski’s novels.\n\nThe spin-off was revealed with a trailer, at the end of second season of Netflix’s The Witcher.\n\nThe reception to Witcher: Blood Origin was lukewarm to say the least. And instead of beginning a marketing campaign for show, Netflix went radio silent on the project.\n\nAs it turns out, the fans weren’t the only ones not convinced by the show. Blood Origins was supposed to come out in May of this year - but the now confirmed – weak reception from Netflix itself, meant the show was going to go through reshoots and a major overhaul. The new release date now being late 2022.\n\n**Summary of the changes:**\n\n\\- Episodes reduced from 6 to 4.\n\n\\- Jaskier **\\[Dandelion\\]** now has far more significant role in the show. Most likely serving as the narrator of the story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ftn1sjbfu3d91.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ba237c58149404874d115272f5d98aa292381e5\n\nAccording to **Redanianintelligence.com:**\n\n*The source did also say that the reshoots and edits were being made in an attempt to bring Blood Origin closer to the main series as well as polish and cut some of the material that was deemed to be weak.*\n\nI think it’s safe to say, that all is not well in Netflix’s Witcher land.\n\nNetflix was aiming for Witcher to be their Game of Thrones. A household series. However… Not only did season 2 of the main series do worse in terms of views, compared to its first season. It also turned away many book- and game fans, with its deviations from the source material and poor writing.\n\nThe universal opinion towards the show, agreed by many, is that its original material is its weakest aspect. And now Netflix – a company already in financial trouble - must spend more money on a spin-off, that might be dead on arrival.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**: *I apologize for not providing links to sources.

        "body": "During the books and video games Nilfgaard is one of the main antagonists, it is made to look like a villainous empire looking to conquer and rule the continent, mercilessly crushing anything that stands in their way.\nThe books and other media revolves around Geralt ,a nordling . I think that the fact that the stories are told from the pov of the north affects greatly the facts told about Nilfgaard.\nThe nordlings describe Nilfgaard as barbarous ruthless and primitive. The few Nilfgaardians the book includes state the contrary, the Nilfgaardins view the north as a place filled with superstitious savages , they see themselves as enlightened people, bringing culture and progress to the northern kingdoms. \n\nReviewing the facts ,I was lead to believe that Nilfgaard was indeed the more enlightened and developed empire opposed the superstitious and backwards north.\nI agree that Nilgaard commits unthinkable crimes and horror during war time, but so is the north.  Both kingdoms are as violent as each other. it’s true that during the books many victims of Nilfgaards cruelty are shown, but the north is also as cruel. For exemple , the way the north treats non humans and the scoiatael is no less inhumane. hanging , pogroms and casual murder of non humans is a common phenomenon in the north.\nAs of progress, nilfgaard is much more developed and modern than the northern kingdoms. In Nilfgaard superstition is much less predominant than in the north. \nNilfgaard gives its women better rights than the north, while in the north wome nare treated badly and aren’t given choice, Nilfgaardian women have more choice over themselves, for exemple , women in Nilfgaard are allowed to get an abortion if they wish, as stated by cahir.\n\nAnother important point to remember is that Nilfgaard did try diplomatic solutions before waging war. On almost all of the occasions Nilfgaard waged war they tried to resolve the matter peacefully by compromising and suggesting to take the kingdoms under their rule, while still offering partial autonomy , doing so improving the lives of the inhabitants .\n\nIn my opinion looking objectively on the matter it appears Nilfgaard isn’t as evil as the books make them. Their reputation is just affected by the side of the story the books cover.\n\nTLDR: Nilfgaard isn’t the bad guy and they’re misrepresented by the north, which is where the books mostly take place",

Again, my friend regards it very highly. \n\nHowever, there’s something that’s been bothering me for a while.\n\nEvery single female character in this book is sexualized.  There isn’t any woman who isn’t introduced with a description of her sexual assets.\n\nTake Sh’eenaz, for example. Literally the first thing we’re told about her is that her breasts are shapely. And then when she appears later, out of nowhere, the book says “her breasts were still magnificent.” Even later, when she’s fully clothed and has transformed into a human, Sapkowski can’t resist describing just how low her neckline is, and how much of her body is on display. \n\nTo contrast, it seems like the only physical description we get of male characters is the color of their jackets, or whether they have scars. \n\nThis sort of thing was less noticeable in The Last Wish, but now it’s gotten to the point where it totally breaks the immersion. I would really prefer to not be thinking about how horny the author was while reading their book.   \n\nSo here’s my question:\n\nDoes it get better? I’d like to read the whole series on my friend’s behalf, and I truly do enjoy the other aspects of the books. But this is just getting ridiculous. \n\nTl,dr: I’ve been growing tired of the constant sexualization of every female character in the Witcher books. Does the series as a whole tone this down at any point? It would be nice to meet a woman Geralt or Dandelion aren’t going to eventually sleep with.",

        "title": "Hello! I am RICHARD SWAN, author of THE JUSTICE OF KINGS, and today you can ASK. ME. ANYTHIIIIING!",
        "body": "Hi folks! I’m Richard Swan, author of the Sunday Times bestselling THE JUSTICE OF KINGS (02/2022) and the forthcoming THE TYRANNY OF FAITH (02/2023), which together are the first two books of the Empire of the Wolf trilogy published by Orbit books.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lcap72zb6e91.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=1efdfbec9e7d2315e1521e90a388b2bc20e858ac\n\nTHE JUSTICE OF KINGS follows the story of Sir Konrad Vonvalt, who has been variously described as a fantasy Cicero, Judge Dredd, Geralt of Rivia, Sherlock Holmes and Eisenhorn. He is an investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner all in one, sworn to travel the Sovan Empire and dispense—well, justice! In order to do this, he has a sword, an unparalleled knowledge of the laws of the empire, and several arcane powers: 1) the Emperor’s Voice, the power to compel people to tell him the truth; and 2) necromancy! But this second one is only to be used VERY sparingly, for reasons which become…. horribly apparent in the book.\n\nWhilst the story, however, is about Sir Konrad, it is in fact narrated by his 19 year old clerk, Helena. Helena is an old woman writing an account of her time with Vonvalt, during an era of great upheaval within the Sovan Empire. THE JUSTICE OF KINGS is, at its core, a fantasy murder mystery but with wider political / conspiratorial intrigues and a system of magic(k) which is derived from the afterlife. But as much as it is this, it also is a study of the relationship between Helena and this ‘great man of history’.\n\nAs for me, I’m a British writer currently living and working in Sydney, Australia. My wife (and 2 small boys) and I moved here in November, though we’ve lived here before. I am, as you might expect, a litigator by trade; I spent 10 years or so working on commercial disputes in various law firms in the City of London, but writing science fiction and fantasy has always been my passion and I’ve been doing it since my early teens. I self-published some stuff in 2015 / 2016 (for a list of my work, feel free to check my GR page here: [https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15016044.Richard\\_Swan](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15016044.Richard_Swan)) before THE JUSTICE OF KINGS was picked up by Orbit (I think the deal was done in late 2019).\n\nThese days my wife does the corporate breadwinning whilst I live out my teenage dream of writing full time; hopefully this is a state of affairs which is set to continue but we shall see!\n\nBecause of the time zone differences I’ll be answering questions in my morning / early afternoon, starting from nowish (so 14:00 Pacific / 16:00 Central / 17:00 Eastern) and 10ish pm London. Do feel free to post questions outside of these times and I can do another pass tomorrow!\n\nSo r/Fantasy: ask me anything!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: thank you everyone for your questions today. Looks like this has reached its natural conclusion. If there are any more questions please feel free to add them below and I'll revisit this thread a little later. Thanks again!**",

I like the concept and the production value of the show is great but the characters and story aren't doing it for me. Also some of the dialogue is way over the top acted and comes off very cheesy. \n\nIs it just a horrible adaptation of the games/books?

He will outshine his fellow mages, don the red cloak, and join the Light’s own soldiers. He will bring victory to his people and honor to his family, clearing its name from his father’s shame.\n\nOr that’s what Akira thinks. Because seers can be devious sometimes.\n\nFrom the rural side of Koya enters Natsu as she assumes her late husband’s place and takes the smuggling underworld by storm.

Only then can she take back her country.\n\nBut the closer she gets to the prince, the more he surprises her with kindness, honor, and wit. He is nothing like his cruel father.

        "body": "Seeing how characters react to world shaking events and terrible danger is all well and good, but I find that the best character building often happens when there's no immediate danger at all.  I love when characters just get a chance to take a breather, sit around, talk about random things, crack jokes, and maybe have a few drinks.  I consider how characters respond to normality just as important as responding to adversity and I love when writers include it.  I figured I'd just see what sort of scenes from various fantasy media spring to mind for others when they think of well written downtime.\n\nMy personal favourite is from The Witcher, Baptism of Fire. After escaping an army camp under attack, the main characters find a sack of vegetables and a pot near a river and on a whim decide to work together to try and make some fish stew.  The entire thing is so wholesomely mundane and the scene is complemented with Geralt angrily complaining about all the people in the group he doesn't trust until they make him start peeling vegetables just so he stops talking.  This scene also includes some of my favourite dialogue in the series, which is another part of downtime scenes I love.",

        "body": " I will never forgive the showrunner and writers for butchering Eskel and Mousesack for no reason at all, turning Cahir into a zealot  psycho, focusing way too much on Fringilla (minor character from the 4th book of the saga which I found very boring and pointless) AND the absence of Shani. I wonder, if the show will not get cancelled after season 3, if they  will even include Skellen´s gang and the respective members and their motivations (I am calling it that they will be just nameless mooks there  just to be slaughtered) and Schirrú (but why would they even bother, there is a „firefucker“ ..)   into the story and i am pretty sure they will show Ciri´s relationship with Mistle as a romantic one. I am dreading that few of my favorite moments from the books, such as The battle of the bridge, Thanned coup (where Ciri dunks on Cahir = Vilgefortz is a complete  joke?!), Battle of Brenna and the fight on Tarn Mira will be compelete a farce as well. After seeing the battle of the Sodden hill, where Yennefer is the hero of the battle (Vilgefortz) and the 14th of the hill (Triss),damn  the Mary Sue factor is strong. The second season is 85% made up and basically a bad fanfiction and I am being generous. I could go on, there are so many flaws, it is way too  Americentrism oriented  (not sure if it is a correctly used term) it has no soul,not the book series I grew up reading, just another fantasy flop.. Which is a shame, so much potential. \n\nI know that people who like the show and are unfamiliar with the source material don´t care, which is completely fine. I expectI will get downvotes or this post will get completely removed, but damn, now I see how fans of   *ASoIaF*  felt.",

        "body": " I received a free copy of this ebook in exchange for an honest review.\n\nTwelve Blades in Contempt is a great debut novel. It's jammed full of well done fight scenes, and it has an interesting magic system and some cool world building. Fans of Cradle will probably enjoy it as it has many similarities, though sadly Twelve Blades doesn't quite reach the very high bar set by Cradle but to be fair, very few books do.\n\nThe writing is great overall, but some of the word and phrase choices sort of pulled me out of the story at times. This is nitpicky, and I imagine most readers won't care. They were few and far between and never major.\n\nWhile I didn't love it, this was a fun book. I'm looking forward to seeing what's next from Jorden. I suggest we all keep an eye out for what's next.\n\n[Goodreads Link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61766082-twelve-blades-in-contempt)",

        "body": "Yennefer likely has BOTH Kyphosis (forward curve of the spine) and Scoliosis (sideways curve of the spine)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4endnpwf2m91.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=17875f911148a82945a47af16c693a32615aa91e\n\nSo the shoulder lifting effect that Yennefer has is due to severe scoliosis. And any scoliosis curvature above about 50° is considered extremely dangerous. And if you’re looking at the picture that’s a scoliosis of 85° and you’re still not seeing that raising shoulder effect as much so Yennefer likely has extremely severe scoliosis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s361ecjzf2m91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0358133498178e6ef14b49a74760afb31763184c\n\nSevere scoliosis often results in a fair amount of issues, the spine literally pushes many of your internal organs places they should not be, specifically harming the lungs and heart the most. With the lungs, the curvature would lead to the lungs being of unequal size or distorted which means there would be atrophy of the pulmonary parenchyma (the stuff that allows for gas transference in the lungs). The number of alveoli would also be reduced, making it much more difficult for her to breathe. Basically, her spine would be pushing her heart and lungs making their functionality much weaker and more prone to disease. In the picture I used, that patient’s severe scoliosis led to a condition known as restrictive lung disease where the stiffness and twisting of the rib cage prevented the lungs from inflating properly.\n\nIn addition, since she’s around 16 in the show at this time, she likely has Scheuermann’s Kyphosis, common in young adults.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30h0xqi1g2m91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2900fd7dc9846832f572a38d91424d78400c25af\n\nNormally this doesn’t come with too many long terms health effects but based on the severity of her forward curve it is likely putting pressure on her lungs. So she would have the scoliosis pushing her lungs and weakening them and the kyphosis constricting them, leading to difficulty breathing and doing strenuous movement. As well, the amount of pain would make it very difficult for her to move her head up and down and also lead to muscular atrophy in the back meaning she wouldn’t be able to lift much.\n\nHer jaw is a mandibular prognathism where you see that intense underbite which isn’t particularly life-threatening but does cause issues with dental development, eating, and speech. She might have some issues eating due to difficulty chewing or her jaw tiring very easily, she would also be dealing with lots of jaw pain as well. \n\nOverall, the scoliosis is the most serious concern and Yennefer would have likely had some severe health complications down the road beyond just chronic pain. Specifically with restrictive lung disease and pulmonary function. This would lead to her having a severely shortened life expectancy without some type of medical, or in the case of the Witcher, magical intervention.  \n\nYennefer especially pre-transformation Yennefer is dealing with a lot more than simply chronic pain. She would be dealing with severe medical issues that would have an impact on how she lives her life. As well, it puts into perspective a lot of Yen’s characterization if it’s understood that people with her disabilities who receive no treatment whatsoever have shortened lifespans. \n\nAlso, consider that post-transformation while she would be physically completely healed because *magic*, there is high chance she might still deal with psychosomatic expressions of pain where her body might be telling her she is fine but her mind is saying that she is still in pain. It’s a disconnect between her mind and body that might happen and would result in chronic pain flareups. ",

        "body": "Looking at all the recent fantasy adaptations, the one thing I notice for many of them is that the screenwriters seem hesitant to really go all out with magic. I realize every setting is different but the pattern is there.\n\n- Game of Thrones.  Part of the themes of the books is >!the gradual return of magic.!< That was almost completely forgotten about in the series and the magic we did see was few and far between.  I was hoping for some magic in House of the Dragon but it seems besides the dragons themselves we’re not getting much of any.\n- Rings of Power.  The 2nd age was supposed to have a lot more magic.  There’s been almost no magic to speak of and they turned >!Galadriel into a warrior, where she should have been more mystical.!<\n- Witcher.  There’s more magic here then in the above series but they even managed to screw it up here by >!taking Yennefer’s magic away in season 2.!<\n\nThe one outlier here is Wheel of Time.  Despite its many flaws, my favorite thing about it was its unabashed use of flashy magic.  \n\nI don’t get why this is a thing in 2022 when CG is relatively cheap.  Do they think that putting actual magic in fantasy adaptations would somehow make them less appealing?",

        "body": "This is a major issue that I've only recently realised I suffer from. I'll immerse myself in a new piece of content - a book, a movie, a show, whatever - and thoroughly enjoy it. But as I delve deeper into that fandom, I'll realise that the fanbase is absolutely terrible. Associating such nonsense with the media puts me in a mindset that is much more receptive to negative aspects of the content, and before long, my list of criticisms will outnumber my list of positives, and I will begin to actively dislike it.\n\nLet's take Rings of Power. It has interesting characters, the visuals are some of the best ever for a TV show, the BGM is great, overall an enjoyable show. But whad'ya know, its community so hateful and toxic that their constant seething is probably visible from f**king orbit. Well, that's awful, you say to yourself. They're weird, you enjoy it, so just ignore them, right? You block out those groups and their nitpickings and try to enjoy the show on your own. And so, you start to watch the next episode, but now it's different somehow. You can't seem to forget that the fandom of this show actively bullied it's artists to the point that the showrunners had to issue a statement just two episodes into the show. And then you start noticing all these minor flaws that you didn't mind earlier because these minor flaws are the only thing the fandom talks about.\n\nIf someone engages with whatever they're a fan of online their opinions are getting shaped by hundreds of thousands of other people's opinions.\n\nAn episode maybe left them a bit cold? - here are umpteen YouTubers explaining how it shows 'contempt for the fans'.\n\nA character wasn't as strongly written as others in that series? - here are hundreds of memes about how they're there to push some agenda.\n\nA popular fan theory wasn't paid off? - here are thousands of articles explaining how this hypothetical direction would have been better than whatever the writers chose.\n\nA female character is flawed then she's downright unlikeable, if she's perfect then she's labelled 'Mary Sue'. A show is either 10/10 or 1/10, there's no in-between.\n\nI am not saying that all criticism is bad, but most of these criticism are by people who hate the show for other reasons but hide behind these minor flaws to shit on the show.\n\nIt's a shame to think about all the stuff that won't be made because studios and writers don't think the risk of creating something new and good is worth the risk of thousands of strangers making conspiracy videos and death threats.\n\n**Edit**: Someone reported me to redditcares, just wow.",

I'm convinced Robert Jordan was stalling or maybe he was paid by the word? Did he not have an editor to reign him in? We all know by now the ridiculousness of constantly smoothing skirts and sniffing which is painful enough. But how is it that every character seems to have contempt for the other gender? Men and women alike spend hours going on about how the gender is good for nothing and predictable and shallow and likes to gossip. \n\nI really like the world of Wheel of Time but my God this has gotten painful to read.  I love Brandon Sanderson and I have been trying to get to his books in hopes he saves the series but I don't know if I can make it. But 8 books in is so far to give up now. But the thought of reading 3 or 4 more enormous books of nothing to get there is starting to feel like a never ending chasm. Anybody else out there feel the same? Is it worth it to get to the Sanderson books? Do any of Jordan's books get better?",

I never really got the feeling that Nilfgaard taking over the northern realms was all that bad. Like, yes, conquering other people is generally not very chill, but it seems like people enjoy a much higher quality of life under Nilfgaard’s rule. Their lands prosper, nonhumans don’t have to deal with as much discrimination, and the only real drawback I’ve seen is that they can be pretty strict about their punishments when people break the law. Maybe when I finally get around to reading the books I’ll have a better understanding of why they’re so bad, but right now I don’t really feel that way.",

        "body": "https://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2022/10/interstellar-gunrunner-by-james-wolanyk.html\n\n4/5\n\nINTERSTELLAR GUNRUNNER by James Wolanyk is something that has been recommended on my feed for some time. Indeed, for years, right under THE RULES OF SUPERVILLAINY it was always being told to me that it was something I might like. The problem was there was always something else in the queue and it wasn't like I didn't have a bunch of other space opera books to read ahead of it. \n\nStill, I remembered the title and when I saw the book trilogy was on sale for 99c, I decided to jump at it and picked up a copy. Here's my review of the first book, Interstellar Gunrunner, that is the first book of...the Interstellar Gunrunner trilogy. Which is how all trilogies should be titled.\n\nThe premise is Bodhi Drezek is one of the worst people in the galaxy. An arms trafficker who gleefully sells to both sides of a war within minutes of one another, manufacturing munitions that very often exist to counteract the ones he just sold, he has made a very lucrative profit from his last deal. The theocratic totalitarian Halcius Hegemony is having no end of trouble wiping out an insurgency (in part because of Bodhi's weapons) and that sustained conflict is what keeps him in business.\n\nUnfortunately, Bodhi is bad with money. Incredibly, obnoxiously, incredulously bad with money. He makes something like 20,000,000 credits from his last deal and proceeds to blow it all on a suite to gather all of his creditors so he can ask for more money for another scheme. As you can gather, it turns out his creditors would rather be paid instead and Bodhi is stunned because the idea of this never occurs to him. He is so incredibly confidant of his ability to charm people into purchases, he has absolutely no fallback position when they aren't. Yes, Bodhi is used to dealing with morons and the fact that there are other people who aren't by his standards is something he's bad at anticipating.\n\nWhat follows is a delightful story akin to the Han Solo novels or similar crime fiction IN SPACE. Bodhi must perform a task to cover all of his debts to a particularly nasty loan shark named Nerikad. Nerikad is basically a collection of sentient algae that wants him to steal something from a tropical planet full of sentient bunnies (all of them ripped like Arnie). Opposing or supporting him will be the Hegemony and the insurgency that they're fighting there.\n\nThe biggest appeal of this book is how utterly contemptible Bodhi is. Seriously, for 90% of the book, Bodhi is reprehensible in a way that would do Edmund Blackadder proud. No secret heart of gold here, he regularly throws his business partners, crew, and innocent bystanders under the bus for the slightest gain. It's a nice contrast to stories where the protagonist is just misunderstood or has a tragic backstory to justify everything he does.\n\nIndeed, the only flaw with the book and its zany con games and betrayals is the fact that the remaining 10% does have Bodhi acting like he's suddenly developed a conscience. I didn't buy it and was genuinely enjoying the protagonist being such an utter scumbag throughout. A guy who thinks he's far more morally ambiguous and charming than he is. Sadly, they felt the need to give him someone redeeming qualities and I am taking off a half-point from my score for the book otherwise.\n\nIt's a well-designed world with lots of interesting tidbits. My favorite element has to be the fact that faster-than-light travel doesn't exist so you have to make contact with cosmic entities who will take you across the galaxy in exchange for human sacrifices, art, or prayers. Just the random insertion of cosmic horror monetized by people like Bodhi. I admit I've never seen Cthulhu used as a taxi before. There's also some other fun bits like Bodhi kidnapping a child prodigy by pretending to be a school representative, his horrible attempts at conning people who see right through him, and the fact he unwittingly may have ended reality once (long story). Highly recommended.",

For example, the ability to seamlessly travel between different areas of the world, the use of fast travel to reduce travel time, and the ability to scale mountains and cliffs are all features that were popularized by Skyrim.\n\nSkyrim has also had a big impact on the way that open-world RPGs are designed. The game's large and detailed world is one of the biggest and most immersive in any video game. This has led to other developers striving to create similarly detailed and expansive worlds for their own games.\n\nIn conclusion, Skyrim is the most important Elder Scrolls game for a number of reasons. It is the most successful Elder Scrolls game to date, it has had a huge impact on the open-world RPG genre as a whole, and it has led to the development of many similar games.\n\n\nTHE WITCHER 3 : THE WILD HUNT.\n\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not only one of the greatest video games of all time, but it is also one of the most influential.

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jelrp41fwrx91.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65898482079c08bf4730de5809622760a4bfdfd7\n\n \n\nScore: ⭐⭐⭐⭐✨ (4,5 out of 5 stars)  \nFull text review: [https://vueltaspodcast.wordpress.com/2022/11/03/the-beast-hunters-the-beast-hunter-of-ashbourn-1-by-christer-lende/](https://vueltaspodcast.wordpress.com/2022/11/03/the-beast-hunters-the-beast-hunter-of-ashbourn-1-by-christer-lende/)  \nInterview with the author: [https://vueltaspodcast.wordpress.com/2022/11/03/some-thoughts-with-christer-lende/](https://vueltaspodcast.wordpress.com/2022/11/03/some-thoughts-with-christer-lende/)\n\nThe Beast Hunters is the first book in a dark fantasy saga, written by Christer Lender. I'm really glad to have found this book, and to pick it by the cover, because it hasn't let me down, being absolutely amazing (I only have one complaint: it's too short), a novel that I would define as The Witcher meets Sherlock Holmes. There are so many things to love on these pages, to be fair.\n\nThis book follows the story of Ara, a 17-years-old girl, who lives with her family, suffering due to the contempt of his father (who evens hit her regularly), and whose life changes as she sees how her family gets brutally murdered before her eyes; and honestly, she's saved just by the pure luck of two strangers who work as Beast Hunters, and she becomes (sort of) her apprentice. Personally, this whole first scene for me it's an intention declaration by Christer Lende, letting clear that we are in a dark fantasy novel, in a hard world. And after this, the real story starts, an adventure full of mysteries, found family, and action.\n\nThere is great work behind the characters in this story, especially on the group that gets formed between Ara and the Beast Hunters. Particularly, I would like to stop to highlight how certain themes are touched with the character of Ara; she's somebody that hasn't gotten appreciation from her family, her self-esteem is non-existent at the moment she is adopted by Topper and Khendrick; and her progression as a character with the help of the Hunters is well crafted, feeling really natural. Khendrick is also a particular kind of character, somebody who has been forged due to his years traveling as Beast Hunter, and with an excellent capability of observation (which is partly why I get those big Sherlock vibes, as that kind of eidetic memory is shared with the Conan Doyle's character); and Topper, well, it's Topper. It's delightful to see the training and learning arc of Ara with these two, meanwhile, their bonds strengthen.\n\nThe worldbuilding is also excellent, something impressive with the short length of the book. There are plenty of fantastical creatures presented, sometimes with entries in the book they maintain as a compendium of their knowledge, sometimes by fighting with them. During their adventure in the city, we can also experiment with the multiple faces of people, and how they react to things they don't really understand. Christer Lender has several surprises for the reader during this arc, letting you with your mouth open several times and hooking you to the book.\n\nI absolutely loved the experience of reading the Beast Hunters. I think there is so much potential in this world, and in our group of characters, which I hope gets developed more in future books. It's a really solid debut, my only complain with it is the length, as it is a short book in my opinion; and totally a recommendation for those The Witcher fans, because the vibes are totally there. Seriously, great job!",

        "body": "Hello :)\n\nMy problem is very simple, as I stated I have not played Witcher 1&2 because at the time I did not have the right devices, now I won’t be buying them anyway, since the studio said there will be remakes of them and I rather want to save up money for them, then buying the old versions now. \n\nSince I did not play the first games, I have no attachment to either Yen nor Triss, but it feels like the game makes me choose based on attachment I should have build up during the old games(which makes sense, but since I can‘t do that I am making this post xD), there is just no real way to get to know them properly, before already engaging in a relationship with them.\n\nSo I ask the people who played the games who have you picked why? I have no problem with spoilers for the other games(I am good at forgetting stuff like that xD) so write whatever you seem fitting. I guess I am interested in which romance felt the most fulfilling, or which felt right and why :)\n\nGreetings from Germany!",

        "body": "If you think about it, Elder Blood or not, Ciri is just a human and none of her human predecessors lived for that long. She seems to be aging at a normal pace, which means she has a regular, human lifespan.\nGeralt and Yennefer are around the same age (at least 100), but they age at a much slower pace. Vesemir was around 170 to my knowledge and he looked about 50-60 where as Philippa and Tissaia were around 300 respectively but looked like women in their 30s to 40s, which might suggest that Sorceresses have a longer lifespan than Witchers.\n\nBasically, Geralt and Yennefer will be forced to watch their daughter age and die, which especially in the case of Yennefer who will most likely outlive them all is very tragic.",

        "title": "Reread: book Triss actually has a great arc and more nuance than I realized",
        "body": "Hey,\n\ntl;dr: Triss has a quite unique, thorough character arc with a positive conclusion, and stands out as a magician in the way she's humanized.\n\nThe following thoughts developed on a reread and after some discussions on this sub, in particular with one person who may recognize themselves.\n\nTriss is usually a controversial character in the Witcher series of books. My point is not to convince you to like her, but that she has hidden nuance that may not be immediately apparent, as well as one of the most fulfilling character arcs.\n\nMy initial reaction to Triss in *Blood of Elves* was more or less \"For real?! what sort of sorceress is that, is she actually in rut or what, that is sooooo annoying\" and later on, I felt she was one of the author's punching balls, never achieving anything after Thanedd and until the Rivian ending, letting Yen down and cowering to Philippa, looking like a walking failure. On that note, I never saw her as especially manipulative, as people tend to suggest. I felt her \"wrong\" deeds stemmed almost entirely out of spinelessness, not of an \"evil\" side or manipulative personality.\n\n***\n\nWhat I came to respect however is her having one of the few thorough character arcs, spanning multiple books, with a positive ending to boot - with a thorough arc defined as one where the character truly accomplishes something, develops or changes in a meaningful way. Few characters in this series can claim one, let alone one that ends well. People either die accomplishing their destiny, or die pointlessly, or both, or don't change in any significant manner.\n\nSo, what's Triss' story in a nutshell? It starts with her Sodden PTSDs, implied to be one reason of her obsession for Geralt (\"And she had only recently understood what pain is. The moment when she had overwhelmingly wanted to be with him again.\") as she's craving for comfort. It doesn't help that Ciri (hacked by Vilgefortz?) prophesies that she'll soon join the grave that was dug for her, that she's living on borrowed time. Next, there's Thanedd's aftermath. Triss joined Philippa's conspiracy out of loyalty to Foltest and the North, and she was rewarded with banishment. At that point she's lost everything, not only her position at court but also her home (that \"little tower in Maribor\"). Meaning she's easy pray for Philippa, who offers her hospitality (as well as, possibly, a little lesbomancy on the side) and presents her with a cause in the form of the Lodge. What ensues is arguably Triss' nadir, her betraying of Yennefer and by extension Geralt. Afterwards, though, she clearly starts doubting the Lodge, realizes having been manipulated, and eventually admits having been \"to blame\". And lastly of course, there's the Rivian pogrom. The hailstorm is very much her moment: she pulls herself together to overcome her worst flaws - cowardice, spinelessness - and actually achieves something. We know from Nimue or Condwiramurs that Triss would be remembered as the Fearless, meaning she would likely show bravery on more occasions.\n\nAnd I believe that's the only \"J-shaped\" arc in the saga. J-shaped as in starting low, sinking lower and ending very high. Does anyway else get such a positive ending?\n\nFor comparison, I think it won't be too controversial to put Triss into the category of \"major secondary characters\", along with, say, Geralt's Hansa. Characters that aren't the main center of attention but do get a relatively large amount of screen time, as well as numerous point-of-views fleshing them out. In that group, the most important one is probably Dandelion / Jaskier but he doesn't really have an arc. He definitely serves a purpose as Geralt's best friend and later narrator of events, but he doesn't develop. Meanwhile, Milva, Cahir or Angoulême mostly follow along (for example, is there anything about Milva past her miscarriage?) and die rather randomly (well, not Cahir, who pulls a legendary heroic sacrifice, worthy of James Potter, that slows Bonhart down by a whopping 4 seconds). It's not like I required them to die an epic death but they do feel like aborted characters in the end, as in \"and? what was their point?\" (exaggerating a bit, perhaps, but you get the idea).\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Hansa characters (aside from Dandelion) have no existence outside of Geralt's path. That is, the camera never dwells much on them independently, if they appear on screen it's because Geralt is nearby. Triss on the other hand gets her short but own moments of spotlight here and there, which give her an existence of her own. That also makes her one of the more fleshed-out characters in the supporting cast, in my opinion.\n\n***\n\nOne other thing I didn't realize immediately about Triss: she has to be the only humanized magician in that story - in her good and bad sides. The others tend to be super-hero / super-villain tier; indomitable, unbreakable, utterly ruthless, very badass, always going to extremes to get what they want. But she's more like a normal woman lost among that crowd. No wonder she looks pathetic in comparison. She gets embarrassingly sick (demolishing some tropes about delicate fairy-looking sorceresses in the process), panics when danger strikes and turns into an obedient carpet in the presence of one powerful, domineering professional manipulator. Oh, and she occasionally weeps. Those are things that could be happen to ordinary, non-heroic people.\n\nIn fact, imo she doesn't really fit well with the Lodge. She looks quite out of her depth, doesn't say much, gets led by the nose. You might argue this is due to her inexperience, which is true, but in part only. Look at Keira for instance: she's probably from the same generation, but she's brutal and callous enough already; just give her 50 more years (not taking her arc in TW3 into account) and you'll have another Sabrina, as an example of another hot-headed action-sorceress.\n\nAs to Triss' good sides. It seems she genuinely wants to help, to do the right thing, to make the world a better place. You can see this in her motivation for working at Foltest's court (\"preventing orphans from being made\", there's no indication she ever cared for personal power), her considering using witcher mushrooms to develop cures, joining Philippa's side at Thanedd out of loyalty to the North and not personal ambition, her shock at the ensuing bloodshed and collateral damage (Lydia, and then the Redanian soldiers incinerated by Tissaia); and even after joining the Lodge, she still cares deeply for Ciri (though she evidently doesn't have what it takes to help her in regard to Philippa's and Shila's plans). Overall she clearly values human life, I doubt she'd harm anyone of cold-blood nor follow a \"the end justifies the means\" type of morality.\n\nAt the same time, due to her insecurities, fear and cravenness even - which, again, are quite human flaws - she fails to live up to her own standards. I interpret her as a fundamentally good person, marred by flaws holding her back. Hence the nuance in her I didn't see on first read. This is what I meant with \"humanized\": she's humanly, \"normally\" good and bad. And the conclusion of her arc is precisely about her beginning to overcome her flaws.\n\n***\n\nI guess I'm done. Thanks for reading! I didn't dwell much on her obsession with Geralt because on that point, there's no defending her as it's definitely unwholesome. She serves a purpose as Miss Friendzone, and I believe that's it. Though again, a normal and otherwise good person turned into stalker because of a crush that won't go away isn't unheard of.",

        "title": "Bingo Row #27 Completed and Card #1 Completed!",
        "body": "Hello all! This is an exciting update for me because the completion of this row means I've also completed my first card! The completed row is Row #5, and the completed card is Regular Card #2. By Regular Card, I simply mean that I wasn't using any particular requirements for the books on this card.  As with my previous updates, I will include my reviews for the books on the completed row. I will then post the completed card after those, along with links to my posts with the reviews for the other rows on the card, in case you want to check on one in particular and missed or don't remember a post.\n\nFor this row, I read **Darke** by Angie Sage for the *Award Finalist (Hard Mode)* square, **Last Gate of the Emperor: The Royal Trials** by Kwame Mbalia and Prince Joel Makonnen for the *BIPOC Author* square, **Zypher** by Zobi for the *Shapeshifters (Hard Mode)* square, **Sandry's Book** by Tamora Pierce for the *No Ifs, Ands, or Buts* square, and **The House Witch 2** by Delemhach for the *Family Matters (Hard Mode)* square.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/noupilnfaf2a1.jpg?width=909&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90a125040db4f790d4bd27566e163c6c3b340026\n\n**Darke** by Angie Sage - 5/5 (MG)\n\nThe books in this series have steadily been getting darker as Septimus and his friends encounter more of the Darke. But this book jumped in with both feet. In the process of banishing Tertius Fume, Marcia Overstrand also banished Alther Mella. Not long after, a Darke Domain called into being by Merrin Meredith begins expanding and takes over the Castle. Marcia is able to call an emergency and erect a barrier to protect the Wizard Tower from the Darke Domain, but it won't last forever. As if that wasn't enough, there is also a Darke Dragon on the loose. It will take the help of everyone - including Simon Heap if Septimus can set aside his anger long enough to work with him - in order to defeat the Darke Domain, though not everyone will survive.\n\nI loved this book. Though it is the penultimate book of the series, it is nice to see everything starting to come together for Septimus, Jenna, Beetle, and all the others. More so in this book than any of the others, the characters are all growing into who they will be as adults. Though they still have a few years to go before they are actually adults, we see them take on more responsibility in this book as they prepare for adulthood. I especially liked seeing Jenna grow into her status as a princess and future queen, which she has thus far in the series been avoiding as much as possible.\n\nI have no idea where the last book of the series is going to go, but I am definitely looking forward to listening to it and finding out.\n\n**Last Gate of the Emperor: The Royal Trials** by Kwame Mbalia and Prince Joel Makonnen - 5/5 (MG)\n\nIn this sequel to Last Gate of the Emperor, which picks up not long after the previous book's ending, we find Yared struggling to adjust to his new life as a prince. Instead of being known as Yared the Gr8, he is now Lij Yared the First, Prince of Axum. Where before it was just Uncle Moti and Besa protecting him, Yared now has to contend with bodyguards, advisors, and parents.\n\nNot only that, but Yared learns that he is to give the opening speech of the Royal Trials, a huge gaming tournament that he also hopes to compete in. Of course, while doing all of this, Yared also has to find time to save the world from the attacking pirates. Has Yared gotten in over his head or will he find a way to pull all of that off?\n\nJust as in the first book, we get this story from Yared's point of view, including all the snark I loved from the first book. From his crazy commentary of the goings-on to his one-sided conversation with Besa - and anyone who's ever been selected as a cat's human will get a kick out of them - I was again entertained from the very first page. At this point, I should just realize that if Kwame Mbalia has written a book, I am going to read said book. It's inevitable.\n\nIn addition to Yared, there is a whole host of other great characters throughout, some new and some returning from the first book, all of which add to the story. One really touching scene is when Yared is talking with his father, the Emperor, about what he should call him. He points out that it's easy for him because there is only one word - son - for him to call Yared. But there are so many different options for Yared to use, he doesn't know which one is best. In typical Yared style, there is levity and snark in the question, but it ends up working really well and highlighting the strange situation he's trying to navigate.\n\nThe world-building in book 1 was fantastic, but it begins to pale compared to this book. Book 1 was set almost entirely on Earth, even if it was a futuristic Earth with lots of tech that we don't have at the moment. But this book allows us to explore that larger galaxy, with other planets, space stations, and various ships showing up.\n\nAs with the first book, I listened to the audiobook version of this book, which was also narrated by Prince Araya Mengesha. As with the first book, he did a fantastic job with this book. His performance of Yared's personality was spot-on and absolutely raised to book to another level. I will absolutely be listening to him narrate book 3 when it comes out because there's no way that Mbalia and Makonnen could leave the story where it ended in this book. I mean, they could, but it would be mean. LOL.\n\n**Zypher** by Zobi - 5/5 (MG/YA)\n\nThis collection of short stories is great for kids and young adults. The stories all deal with many of the issues that they face today, from racism and bullying to self-esteem and identity. While some of the dialogue is a little forced in places, reminding me of cartoons from the 1980s, that same dialogue will also help the young reader understand some situations a little better, and that understanding will help them grow.\n\nI also liked how the last short story served as a kind of epilogue, revisiting each previous story and expanding on it while also tying all the stories together with a little more strength than just \"they all take place on Zypher.\" I do hope the author writes a full-length novel that takes place on Zypher. I think that would be fun to read.\n\nEdit: I recently had the chance to listen to the audiobook of these short stories. First, it was great to revisit the stories. The narrator, Oliver Johnson, did a wonderful job. His narration was slightly different for each story, which made it easy to tell when one story ended and another began. After revisiting these stories, I am definitely hoping the author will write either more short stories or a longer single story within this world because it is definitely a world I would like to experience more of.\n\n**Sandry's Book** by Tamora Pierce - 5/5 (MG)\n\nI discovered Tamora Pierce last year with Alanna and enjoyed it so much that I decided I needed to read all of her books. I was introduced to Sandry in the book Magic Steps and Briar in Street Magic. Reading those books slightly out of order, since they took place after the Circle of Magic series, I figured I should go back and read that series first, before continuing the Circle Opens series with Tris's and Daja's stories.\n\nWith the title of this book, I went into it thinking that I would be introduced to Sandry only. Instead, I was surprised to meet all 4 mages - Sandry, Tris, Briar, and Daja - almost immediately with little vignettes that described their lives prior to being taken to the Winding Circle community for education. Sandry isn't accepted because of her noble birth and status, Briar because of his tattoos marking him as a thief, Daja because she's a Trader, and Tris because of her apparent connection to the weather. When their inability to live with the other students without causing fights, they are sent to live in Discipline House with Lark and Rosethorn to learn how to control their unique magics; magics that they didn't even realize they had. For while all were brought to Winding Circle by Nico, none of them are really aware of their own magic.\n\nDespite the surprise at meeting all 4 characters so quickly, I definitely liked this book. After reading Street Magic, Briar quickly became a favorite character, and I really liked learning more about his history and early struggles. It was tough to read about the children's early days at Winding Circle, with the bullying they received at the hands of the other children, then the early distrust they had amongst themselves when they moved into Discipline House, though the latter was understandable and my reaction was more because I had the knowledge of their later relationships from reading the later books.\n\nI definitely enjoyed seeing how they all developed with their own magic, and how Lark, Rosethorn, Frostpine, and Nico were able to support each of them in that development. Still, with my soft spot for Briar already established, I think my favorite scene is when he rescues the dying tree from the other disciple's greenhouse. He has such a big heart that he keeps hidden except when it comes to plants, and I love seeing it come out.\n\nSeeing the four of them cooperate and work together at the end with the magic they work together, each of them using their individual talents in a way that supported and increased the ability of the others was also amazing. It truly highlighted the strength that comes through friendship and working with others instead of against them. This book yet again highlighted how wonderful Tamora Pierce's writing is and I look forward to reading/listening to more of her books.\n\nAs for the audiobook version, which I listened to for this book, it got better as it went on. Early on, Tamora Pierce, who was the main narrator, sounded somewhat flat when the book didn't have a specific character point of view, then developed more depth and feeling when the words were clearly coming from a particular character's point of view. As the book progressed, though, she got better and there was much less flatness. With that adjustment, I suspect that the early flatness was due to not having much experience with narration. It certainly won't keep me from listening to later audiobooks.\n\n**The House Witch 2** by Delemhach - 5/5\n\nPicking up the morning after book 1 ends, Finlay Ashowan, Royal Cook, is feeling pretty good about things. After all, he had bared his heart only the night before and had not only not been spurned, but learned his feelings had been reciprocated. If only everything else would go that well. But, while Fin's love life is now going well, there are still many problems for our favorite house witch. His mother is still caring for the queen and her unborn child, though there is growing opposition to that from the nobility. In addition, while there is word that there are Troivackian soldiers hiding in town, no one can find any sign of them. Add to that the impending arrival of Aidan Helmick, Fin's absent father, and there are still a lot of things to worry about.\n\nWhen Fin asks for a few days off, King Norman decides to take advantage of Fin's relative anonymity to find out more about the soldiers in town by assigning the role to Fin. And Fin, being Fin, tries his best. Is it really his fault that his \"best\" ended up causing a tavern brawl, which led to Fin cooking for everyone, which spread to a festival in the streets? Well, maybe. But is it also his fault that Fin nearly gets both of his legs broken by a local madam when he dares to interfere with said madam's business? Ok, yeah. That probably is. We all know that Fin is really, really good at annoying people.\n\nOne of the best parts of this book, as with the previous one, is the way that Fin not only annoys so many people but how he also manages to weasel his way out of trouble. In this book, we see Fin making more friends, even grudgingly among those who probably wouldn't admit it, as well as some enemies. We also get an incredible scene in which Fin demonstrates just how dangerous of a witch he is by destroying a... no, wait a minute. He didn't do that. Nope. Instead, Fin demonstrates how dangerous he is by - wait for it - folding laundry. Yes, you read that correctly. No, I'm not going to explain it. You are just going to have to read the book to find out.\n\nAdditionally, we get some history about the King and Queen, which helps the reader connect with those characters even more, and may end up bringing a few tears to a few eyes. As with the first book, we get a few scenes with Fin's familiar, who also has some new skills to share.\n\nAs with the first book, this one ends on a sort-of cliffhanger. I say sort of because there are several things that aren't answered. However, it's not a cliffhanger that's going to make you yell at the author and demand recompense for toying with your feelings or treating the characters so terribly. Indeed, one could even stop the series with this book. There would be unanswered questions, but it would be possible. I don't know why someone would, but one could. I, on the other hand, will definitely be continuing on with the series. I think you should, too, but I obviously cannot make you do so.\n\nAs with the first book, I listened to the audiobook. It was again narrated by Matthew Wolf. As with the first book, he did a great job and was able to pull me fully into the story. If you liked the first book of this series, you will most likely enjoy this one. If you haven't read the first one, you should; then you can enjoy it, then read this one. In the same vein, if you listened to the first one and enjoyed it, then go ahead and listen to this one.\n\n\\-----\n\nIf you have read to this point, thank you for your time and attention. Since you have made it this far, you also get to see my first completed card, in its entirety! If you want to read my reviews about any of the other books on the card, the reviews for Row #1 can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/yvlgje/bingo_row_25_completed/), Row #2 can be found [here (Completed Row #4),](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/vsg58w/4th_and_5th_bingo_rows_completed/) Row #3 can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/xo2btu/bingo_row_13_completed/), and Row #4 can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/v9stab/second_completed_bingo_row/). Note: I just remembered that the second books on rows 3 and 4 were actually swapped after I had posted the completed rows because they fit the hard modes of the new squares, so those reviews will be on rows 4 and 3, respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The star ratings on here are a different scale and are related to how likely I was to read the book. 1 star represents a book that I was going to read regardless of whether or not it fit a bingo square, 2 stars represent a book that was close to the top of my TBR list, 3 stars represent a book that was lower down on my TBR list and read sooner because it fit a square, 4 squares represent a book that I discovered because of this bingo challenge but that I would have read had I discovered it otherwise, and 5 stars represent a book that I read only because it fit a bingo square. For last year's bingo, I tried to have as many 5-star books as I could to expand my horizons. This year, with the very expansive size of my TBR list, I was much more flexible in that aspect.](https://preview.redd.it/7gahwsnjaf2a1.jpg?width=1271&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a996efe06b659ff4ffa853cab0cd3e44b8a5e7d9)\n\nWith the completion of this row and card, I have now read 241 books for bingo, with 59 left to go. I didn't get as many books read for this bingo challenge in the last week as I normally would have because I was working on completing another bingo challenge that ends at the end of the month, and there wasn't much crossover between that card and these cards. But I did get to read some really good books, and that's what counts. Of the 33 rows I still have left to complete, I now only have 1 row that has 4 open squares. There are 3 rows with 3 open squares, 17 rows with 2 open squares, and 12 rows with 1 open square. I still have one card, the Red Cover card, that doesn't have a single completed row on it yet, but 1 of them only has 1 open square and the other 4 have 2 open squares, so I'm hoping to be able to get a completed row on it in the near future.\n\nUntil next time, Happy Reading!",

        "body": "Next Witcher Live-Action Spinoff Revealed\n\nThe Witcher‘s first live-action spinoff called Blood Origin starring Michelle Yeoh arrives in just a month, while the Henry Cavill, Freya Allan and Anya Chalotra-led The Witcher will be on our screens in Summer 2023. It would seem that there could be a slight drought of news between Blood Origin and The Witcher, but that is no longer so as we now know a new live-action prequel is currently being developed.\n\nThe new spinoff will explore The Rats\n\nWe have learned that the next live-action spinoff of The Witcher will explore the infamous group of young Nilfgaardian misfits called The Rats. In the books, The Rats are featured in Ciri’s storyline as she joins them for a period of time. In The Witcher Season 3, The Rats will be featured in episodes 7 and 8, when Ciri will first meet them. They are meant to be featured even more in Season 4 of The Witcher. But between Seasons 3 and 4, we’ll have the spinoff.\n\nIt isn’t clear whether the spinoff will be their origin story set before meeting Ciri or whether it will be during their time with Ciri and before the events of Season 4, so at the moment we’re reluctant to call it a prequel.\n\nThe intention of the production team to explore The Rats’ characters before Season 4 arrives is rather understandable as Ciri will be spending quite a bit of time with them. Nevertheless, The Rats as characters are not very well loved in The Witcher fandom and dedicating and entire spinoff to them would require no small effort to make them more interesting and appealing.\n\nWho is cast as The Rats in The Witcher?\n\nAs we already know, The Rats will first be introduced in The Witcher Season 3. If there are no issues with the production and casting, we expect all of The Rats cast members from Season 3 to reprise their roles in the new spinoff.\n\nFirstly, there is Christelle Elwin as Mistle, the very first Rat to be announced as we will probably seeing her the most among the group due to her connection to Ciri. Elwin’s credits include Netflix’s Half Bad and Bloods. Her official casting even came with an official description:\n\n“Mistle is a member of The Rats, a gang of misfit teenagers who steal from the rich and give to themselves – and sometimes the poor. She is street hard, suspicious of everyone and out for revenge, until a chance meeting that will change everything.“\n\nNext up we have Fabian McCallum as Kayleigh, who most recently appeared in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on Amazon. Kayleigh is rather most known for his attempt to commit a certain terrible act in Time of Contempt. His backstory includes him being the adopted son of the castellan of Ebbing, which was sacked and burned by the Nilfgaardian forces. Later he met Reef.\n\nIn The Witcher, Reef will be played by Juliette Alexandra.  In the novels, Reef was a Nilfgaardian who served the Usurper before Emperor Emhyr rose to the throne. During one siege, Reef was wounded and abandoned on enemy territory by their fellow soldiers. Reef was then found and saved by Kayleigh. We also strongly suspect that Aggy K. Adams will be playing Iskra in The Witcher. Iskra was an elf who was exiled from elven territories. Her chances of survival were slim until she joined the Rats. Aside from that, the remaining members of The Rats are Asse, a blacksmith’s son and Giselher, the leader of the group and its oldest member.\n\nSeason 3 of The Witcher is in post-production for a Summer 2023 release. The live-action prequel The Witcher: Blood Origin has been set a Christmas 2022 release.\n\n*By Gravemaster on November 26, 2022*\n\nSource: Redanian Intelligence [https://redanianintelligence.com/2022/11/26/next-witcher-live-action-spinoff-revealed/?s=09](https://redanianintelligence.com/2022/11/26/next-witcher-live-action-spinoff-revealed/?s=09)",

I have put off the series for a while as found Season 2 a bit of a slog and the inaccuracies have bothered me but Burn, Butcher, Burn! Is an amazing song. Maybe it's just the pain you feel in his voice but it is sung brilliantly and I loved his scene in S2 Ep 4.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way who are fans of the source?",

        "body": "Hi!\n\nI asked for some recommendations for a gift I'm buying someone in the daily thread and got some good suggestions! However, due to my own negligence in details, I'm asking for more! \n\nBasically, what the title says, but feel free to recommend those that don't match exactly. I'll let the giftee explain what they like in their own words:\n\n> I typically like fantasy that's set in \"medieval\" times like The Witcher, The Hobbit, Game of Thrones. I'm all about it starting a series so it doesn't have to be a standalone. \n\n> I really like when the book has great, well developed characters like my favorite series Throne of Glass. I'm phased out of Young Adult, but Crescent City by Maas is a good example of Adult Fantasy that is pretty fresh. \n\n> I typically buy more female leads, but Geralt of Rivia is my boy so I will read just about anything\n\n > I also do love love love horror books. Like it could be demons, spells, or Michael Meyers coming at you. A good horror book is priceless\n\nI've also gotten a list of books they've read as well [right here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1az43P17JAElQRqxqNNcFHh1a9Da1zg6B9ZvYwEatIW4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nLast request! They want books that are available in *HARDCOVER* only please!\n\nSorry if this is a lot to ask, but I'll really appreciate any and all suggestions!\n\nThanks!\n\nOh and I've already got *A Deadly Education* by Naomi Novik for them :)",
