        "body": "It feels like a low budget B series, with amateurish directing, lots of dramatic overacting, endless cliches, Wal-Mart costume design, awkward pacing and timeline, hilariously forced and pointless romances, weird CGI, and a very weak script. The dialogue and acting is just bad; it feels like a show for teens and tweens, not adults. The character interactions seem inauthentic and unnatural in just about every scene, which made it boring as hell to watch. And the creature CGI, oh God. I could not stop laughing during that scene where the goat monster jumps out of the brush and screams \"LEAVE ME BEEEE!!!\" I mean, just look at [that](https://imgur.com/a/ktlhxeG) shit lmao. It literally looks like the film crew just said \"eh, fuck it\" and picked up a $30 Halloween mask from party city. The way many of the scenes transitioned into the next felt so unnatural and lacked any sense of fluidity, I don't really know what to compare it to. It was very jarring and even confusing at times, almost like a montage of scenes sloppily thrown together. Honestly, this show gave me flashbacks to the live action avatar the last airbender movie. Okay, it's not *that* bad, but it's still far from being good. I think Henry Cavill could probably pull off his role as Geralt but for some reason he acts like a first year drama student here, I blame the director and the writers.\n\nOverall, it deserves at most a 4/10. If it weren't for the lore that has drawn in so many fans from both the books and the games, this show would not be receiving the ratings it's been getting so far. Anyways, just thought I'd give my opinion and see what everyone else here thought so far.",

With all the prejudice against elves, even within the Mage community (think about people's reaction to Yen's status as quarter elven) I don't get how Francesca could rise to such a powerful position?\n\nI'm probably just overthinking this, but I really hope they don't cut Francesca or change her to not be a respected figure within the Brotherhood just to fit with the whole elves as a hated species theme?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'm hoping my worries are wrong and Francesca turns up in her rightful position alongside Tissaia and Vilgefortz on the Chapter!",

Episode 2 (FOUR MARKS) — loved Yen’s backstory and really loved Tissaia’s character; it really grabbed my attention.\n\n3.) Episode 3 (BETRAYER MOON) — I really liked The Witcher short story and Triss’s incorporation into it.\n\n4.) Episode 7 (BEFORE A FALL) — Found it kind of emotional/shocking seeing Tissaia kind of break when she told Yen to join the battle. And this episode finally showed us an interaction between Yen and Triss. Wish they had more scenes together to show their friendship though.\n\n5.) Episode 6 (RARE SPECIES) — tbh I didn’t like the cgi on the dragon, but I liked how the episode showed how complicated Yen and Geralt’s relationship can be.\n\n6.) Episode 5 (BOTTLED APPETITES) — I didn’t really like the changes the writers made, but I really liked Jaskier’s humor in here.\n\n7.) Episode 4 (OF BANQUETS, BASTARDS, AND BURIALS) — the humor, fighting choreo, and Calanthe were what stood out for me.\n\n8.) Episode 1 (THE END’S BEGINNING) — I really liked the fight against renfri’s gang and I also liked renfri’s character, but the lesser evil felt a little too rushed imo.",

(following books story) \n\nHaving that said, I'm confused as to what actually happened to Eyck. Did tv show do it on purpose that way to change Eycks final fate  or did I miss something?",

It is a perfect blend of Monster of the Week plot line and cross-cutting plot line. Its one of the best episodes i ever saw on TV ever.",

        "body": "Preface: I have never read nor played any Witcher. I watched the show based solely on the high praise I heard about them.\n\nI have watched every episode of the show, and the magic system has left me confused. When we very first see magic, Yennefer conjures a portal seemingly out of nothing and emotion. To me this sets a precedent of a soft \"magic system\". \nWe then see Istredd also produce a portal with a flower and a spoken phrase. Later still, when Yennefer starts her training with the stone and the flower, the effect on Fringillas hand, then Tissaia's use of the flower made me think, \"Ok so magic depends on a sort of 'Law of Exchange'.\" This is also reflected later when the Nilfgaard mages drain their lifeforce to create the fireballs for the trebuchet. \n\nAlso during Yennefers training, we see Tissaia turn some magical girls onto eels and put them in a pool, seemingly using them as a sort of magical battery, and telling Yennefer that like the flower, sometimes the best they can do is to die. This is backed up later when Yennefer describes them as a \"windmill\". \n\nElsewhere in the show we see that Ciri and Pavetta can seemingly do magic simply with emotion and screaming, while costing them nothing, and presumably not drawing from any source other than themselves.\n\nMy question overall is this. Has magic always been so fluid or are the showmakers just waving their hands around mysteriously? It seemed like the \"good guys\" were able to do magic with next to no resources or consequences, while the \"bad guys\" had to injure themselves or draw on something. I don't need magic to be wrapped up in a neat bow, but it seems a bit like the show tries to explain it, then just ignores the rules when theyre inconvenient.",

That’s how I understood the quote from Tissaia in the book, that of those mages who are fertile the majority is women, not that the majority of woman mages is and thus has to be sterilised:\n\n“Most of us wizards lose the ability to procreate due to somatic changes and dysfunction of the pituitary gland. Some wizards — usually women — attune to magic while still maintaining efficiency of the gonads. [..] I ask most emphatically: each one of us must decide what she wants to be — a wizard or a mother.\n\nI demand all apprentices be sterilised. Without exception.”\n\nI guess I was wrong.",

        "body": "As some may know, Torque (https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Torque) appeared not only in the recent Netflix TV series but also in the old Polish TV show Hexer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hexer_(TV_series)), which didn't garner great reviews back then.\n\nBut I was really disappointed in how Torque looks in the Netflix show.  As in, crappy plastic mask. I am disappointed, the show is supposed to have a big budget, but clearly, poor Torque got next to none of it. And frankly, I think he looked better in the derided Polish movie/TV series) from ~10 years ago.\n\nScreenshot conparison: \n\nTorque in The Hexer (I found 2 screens)\nhttps://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/File:Torque-film.jpg and https://wiedzmin.fandom.com/wiki/Plik:FA_Torque.jpg\n\nI couldn't find screens of Torque from the Netflix show yet (sure, I could screen and upload them myself, but I am not great with that, I trust someone will do it soon and link a selection, TIA).\n\nThat entire The Hexer episode (it was actually the 7th ep of the TV series) can be found on youtube if you search for \"Wiedźmin HD Odinek 07 Dolina Kwiatów (720p)\", I am not linking it as I am not sure if it is allowed to do so here. For Torque, fwd to about 32:00, and watch the next few minutes.\n\nSo, which version to you prefer? The Hexer or Netflix?",

This is particular strange considering that we were told that Sodden Hill is the main crossing. Also North of the Yaruga she would have been completly out of Nilfgaards reach according to everything that was said during the show. \n\nSecondly, why did Cahir assume Ciri was North of the Yaruga when he wanted to lead the army through Sodden Hill?\n\nThirdly, if the goal of the Mages was mainly to hinder the Nilfgaardian army from crossing the Yaruga, wouldn't it been easy enough to just destroy the bridge? \n\nAnd lastly, how the hell was Filandravel able to attack Cintra? Wouldn't he necessarily have to cross the Yaruga too?",

        "title": "Unwarranted Triss Hate",
        "body": "Let me just start by mentioning I've never read the books, though I've played Witcher 2 & 3 multiple times.  Triss has always been my all time favorite character from very early on in the games, so as a huge fan I would be extremely upset with bad casting but this actress has received so much uncalled for and unnecessarily rude hate.\n\nFirst on her acting.  I think you guys are seriously nitpicking way too hard.  I've been seeing people say she is a \"straight up terrible actress.\"  This is just not true.  I feel like the lot of you insulting her have not seen what ACTUAL bad acting looks like.  She is really a fine actress.\n\nSecond on her appearance.  Now I understand how people could dislike the changing of a main characters race into something else just to fit a \"diversity\" agenda, but for real?  I couldn't even tell this actress was a POC.  She could easily pass as a just a tan Caucasian, heck my dad is a German immigrant and is even darker than her.  But in the grand scheme of things I don't see how it matters at all, and getting mad they cast a woman of color for Triss is ridiculous.  (she's absolutely gorgeous too, and even has freckles!)\n\nAlso people are angry over the fact her hair isn't \"as red as it's supposed to be.\"  In the books I'm pretty sure her hair is described as chestnut anyway, which is a shade of brown.  And anyways, her hair is still red in the show... not very hard to tell.  (I would have liked her to have her cute hair buns though) Another thing I've seen people complain about is the fact she looks old?  She's literally 27 and people are out here acting like she looks 40...\n\nNow something I have seen being said that I somewhat agree on is the fact she didn't appear as much of the \"staple\" character she's supposed to be, but this is just bad script writing/show running, not the fault of the actress or Triss lol.  I'm pretty sure Triss was a huge part of the Battle of Sodden Hill but they made her seem like a side character and let Yennefer steal the show.  Also there was not any exposition on Triss like there was with the others, even though she's supposed to be a main character.  (hopefully they will add her backstory or something into the next season)  Like how did her and Yennefer meet? Think there should have been a bit of explanation there.  There just wasn't enough of her in the show as there should have been, in my opinion.\n\nEDIT: I've been informed Triss is more of an important side character instead of a main character.  (as I said I haven't read the books, and most of the information I got about her was from her wiki or other reddit users so I misinterpreted) Though, I still stand by the fact they could have made her seem more important this season, but in the long run it doesn't really matter as long as they implement that later.\n\nEDIT 2: Ive stopped responding/reading the replies here. It seems like a lot of people in this subreddit are incapable of being civil or can’t defend their point without being rude... some of you have even bridged the point of being borderline racist. Argue amongst yourselves.",

I've only played The Witcher 3 and its expansions, so understand that I'm not hating on the show, there are just some things I might not understand yet.\n\nI really enjoyed the show overall, but felt that there was too much jumping around with the timelines. I think the idea was good, but poorly executed. It would've been better to have them more spaced out.     \n  \nThe Fall of Cintra is really the biggest offender for me in this regard. Seeing it in the first episode, then seeing Geralt and Jaskier there, then seeing the lead-up to the fall of Cintra was really just a bit much.\nI felt that Yen's story started out really good, but as it went on, I felt that Yen was this very angsty character and it was really off-putting.  \n\nCiri's storyline was really good though, and it was honestly the parts of the show I loved the most. Her actress did an amazing job.  \n\nAll the actors did a really good job, except maybe Fringilla, although that may be in part due to her lack of screen time.  \n\nOverall, the show was really good and the story was really easy to understand once you figured out where in the timeline things were taking place. Nilfgaard armour was bad though. Even simple black leather would've been a better choice than what they went with. I know it's going to improve though, so I'm not really worried about it.",

        "body": "I'm happy that the actors they picked are getting work but I have to call out the creative decision they made in regards to dwarves... Witcher dwarves  are not \"smaller humans\" or literal human dwarfs... they're supposed to be chest-high walls of meat, stocky and robust; different proportions and overall more muscular such that, despite their height, you wouldn't want to fuck with one. In the show, they range from \"wiry human of below average height\" to \"thigh-high literal real-life dwarfs\" Again, I'm not disparaging real-life dwarfs, it's just this is a fantasy setting and this is just straight up not what the dwarves are supposed to look like. I'm truly flabbergasted at this.\n\nThe first few times we see, I assume, dwarves, I thought, \"ok, no that looks more like they're playing this off as being a halfling, which is in itself off, or maybe they're doing gnomes differently or something\" but then we get to episode 6 and it's just a whole barrel of wtf when it becomes clear that they straight up have zero standard set for dwarven physiology in the show world. Yarpen Zigrin is the closest they come to a character resembling an actual dwarf and the rest of his company is all over the place in size and appearance to an unreasonable degree to the point I was again like \"wait... so are these all supposed to be dwarves like in the book or is this a mix of dwarves and halflings?.... Because they said 'dwarves' but Yarpen's the only one who comes close to how a dwarf is supposed to be which means some of his pals are clearly not dwarves...\" Also, the first time we see Yarpen he's hopping on the goddamn bar which is not something I'd imagine a race of chest-high walls of meat doing.\n\nI'm sure I'll get lots of flack for this post and I again want to reiterate that I have no problem with irl dwarves being cast in roles... it's just that if you're going to make a show about an established fantasy universe with established race physiology it gets really confusing and immersion-killing when you bastardize it to this degree. I don't know why they thought this was a good idea and it comes off as completely half-assed. Eg. Warwick Davis does a fine job as Willow Ufgood in Willow but he'd make a piss poor Gimli in LOTR... so why the actual fuck is The Witcher series basically doing the latter *and* simultaneously casting short non-dwarf actors into dwarven roles *and* just overall ignoring what they're actually supposed to be? Bottom line is that the approach they took to dwarves in the show is fucked, they neither set nor followed any standard, and I hope they do better in the future. The way dwarves have been done thus far is lazy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Fixing typos",

Removing her encounter with Geralt at Brokilon however was a weird choice, it could have made the last scene of the season even more powerful (I did tear up, though).\n\nMy least favorite has to be Fringilla. By having her go to Aretuza and having a personal grudge against Yen for not taking her position in Nilfgaard is just weird. I get that they needed a villain companion for Cahir but it basically nullifies that there are mages in the south who know nothing of the north. It fortifies that Aretuza is the only school for girls and every single female mage in the south came from there. The best thing about her was how weird she thought these northern people are and how foreign the mages and their behavior were to her. Also, she should have blinded Yen, I’m a little resentful they left that one out. Or maybe they’ll introduce it next season.",

I really don't like what they did with them.The short stories were so much more than this. I read them last year and the thing I remember most about them were the conversations like the one about chaos and order with borch and about destiny between eithne and geralt they really butchered the whole brokilon storyline and the same with renfri like how did geralt find out they were going to start murdering people(in the books he had a conversation with someone about one of the member of her gang that he was in an ambush of a ship and the captain locked himself in his cabin so they started murdering his crew until he came out) and the writers also cut the whole dana maedhth storyline from the edge of the world too. The whole second episode felt so rushed. They changed so much from the books took a lot out from the short stories and for what so we could watch yenefer throw some eels in a pool. Writers left out massive plot points. The last scene with ciri didn't hit hard either how did ciri recognize geralt she saw him in a dream or something. All of the short stories felt empty they left a lot of the stuff out that would have been really important for the world building.\n\nEdit: Well a lot of people are saying they trade key elements of the short story out that were really important for world building for the stuff that was critical to the main plot but we didn't really get the main plot did we. We got dara a character that didn't had any impact on ciri I know how he told her that her grandmother didn't only do good but the refugees camp scene portrayed that well enough and what did ciri do in brokilon again? Geralt and calanthe's character in a question of price were portrayed as waving their hands in the air going FUCK DESTINY but thats not geralt at all he just believes that destiny can't be it there has to be something more. They also decided to give all of that sweet vilgefortz action to yen they didn't really have to they expanded on her character enough this season and the scene with cahir and vilgefortz was really unnecessary too. I know they can't follow the books word for word but a lot of the stuff they left out and the creative decisions they made messed with the source material and didn't have the same impact that's why the last scene where geralt and ciri met fell flat.\nNow with all this said really looking forward to the next season.",

I don't know if it is cultural difference or different vision but it really hurting me what they did with a Nilfgaard. And I don't care about armor anymore. It looks horrbile but I know that they gonna change it in the next season. I don't understand why we get some dark, necromantic forces. Nilfgaard Empire was well organised, clever and rich. It was based on Nazis or Roman Empire. It would be great if they show us normal side of Nilfgaard in next season, maybe even visually inspired by Rome. And I know, they wanted to show us brutal face of war, but I think that the worst part of the war is that you get two innocent teenagers fighting with each other in the name of something that they don't even understand, or father of children who is raping a girl when he is far from home, because he can't be punished. War making casual people hurting other casual people just because they can, not because they are forces of the darkness. Please Lauren, don't go this way, don't make from witcher another \"evil vs good\" fantasy.",

Fringilla is a good actress despite not looking the part - she has a menacing presence and can hold a scene. Triss is a bit harder but even she works well with Yen, acting like the younger, inexperienced one and even her imaturity is present to an extent.\n\nBut Sabrina on the other hand, aside from looking like the books described her, has nothing of the book Sabrina - no ferocity or her impulsive nature. No seeming rivalry with Yen and the soft voice that sounds nothing like Sabrina. She was probably the one that left me disappointed more so than Triss. I imagined her to be far more vocal and present.",

        "title": "The Witcher is awesome, but I still disliked certain things...here is a list :-)",
        "body": "SPOILERS ahead so please don’t read if you haven’t watched the series yet.\n\nFirst of all, I want to say that I really like the series. It is not easy to turn those books into a television series and I understand that sometimes you need to change certain things in order to have a story that connects. I also think Henry Cavill is brilliant in his role, he really captured Geralt.\nHowever, there are certain things that I, as a fan of books and the video games, kind of disliked. Some more and some less.\n \nSo here is my list of dislikes or things that maybe they could have done better. Again, it is simply my personal opinion, not a God given truth lol.\n \nSo here is the list of my dislikes about the show in no particular order:\n \n1)     Dandelion/Jaskier’s style of singing:\nIt sounds more like watching American Idol than a medieval fantasy series when he sings, I half-expected a drum machine and electric guitars to cue in. In the game Witcher 3 there is a song called “Priscilla’s Song” and that is a good example of how a medieval bard should sound like, and what such songs can sound like. As a character he’s written really well so I am surprised they went with such a modern twist on his music, it doesn’t really work for me. Good songs, but they don’t fit the series. However, I would say that this is a minor dislike and I can live with it.\n\n2)     Dryads:\nSomehow, the vicious protectors of the forest and green-skinned mythical creatures that can bend trees to their will have turned into a bunch of humans that simply look like they lost their way in the forest and decided to make their home there because they didn’t know where else to go. That is my impression at least. My biggest peeve is that they look like just a bunch of humans living in a hippie commune and on top of it all they use crossbows! Those were not Dryads.\n\n3)     Nilfgardian armor:\nWhat the hell was that? Seriously. It looked like some wrinkled cloth. It looked terrible, like something out a bad sci-fi movie from the 70s.\n\n4)     Triss:\nTriss, as we know, is supposed to be the young, playful, idealistic sorceress. She is in a way Ciri’s big sister because Yen, who is much older than Triss, is like a mother to Ciri. So everything tells us that she is young and cute. Then why in the world does she look like Geralt’s old aunt in the series?? Lol. I mean looks older than both Geralt and Yennefer and is not good looking at all. I know it is not nice to talk about other people’s looks but in this case I believe it is justified because they are actors who are supposed to portray certain characters of certain age and appearance and the casting director must have been blind or knew next to nothing about who Triss is or is supposed to be. Actually, they messed it up with absolutely all the sorceresses in my opinion when it comes to looks, except Sabrina Glevissig. Which brings me to:\n\n5)     Yennefer:\nGreat actress, great job on showing the development of Yen’s character. However, visually I just don’t see Yennefer. I am not saying that she has to look exactly like in video games. But she needs to be stunning, because she is referred to as or implied to be stunning in the show. Like when she enters the ball and everyone stares at her in amazement for example. And even though the actress is kind of cute she is really not stunningly beautiful, she doesn’t have that something that would make men lose their minds.\nAlso the one thing that I thought was unnecessary was Yennefer burning down the whole of Nilfgardian forces. Now I may be wrong, because it has been a while since I read about the battle of Sodden, but I don’t remember that part. I think it’s bad because if Yennefer can take out the whole Nilfgardian battalion all by herself then there is absolutely no need for soldiers, other sorceresses, generals, or anybody else for that matter. She is obviously the most powerful creature on the planet so just perch her up on highest point and have her decimate Nilfgard within seconds, and there, the war is over.\nAs far as I recall, in the last book there is a detailed explanation of how and why Menno Coehoorn failed and lost the battle of Sodden and it all had to with tactics.\nAgain, like I said, it’s been a while since I read about it all so I might be wrong.\n\n6)     Only 8 episodes:\nSo my final dislike is actually a joke. Regardless of what I already wrote, in the end I really liked the show and I can’t wait for season 2, even with all these dislikes. Maybe in time I will learn to teach myself to look past Triss’ wrinkles and the fact she is just a crystal ball away from looking like an old fortune teller lol",

I was really shocked how Geralt did accused Jaskier that the reason of all of his troubles is bard. I more shocked that ppl are not discussing about it. I understand that after their \"fight\" Jaskier will removed himself from Witcher life, however maybe it is just my bad interpretation.\n\nFrom one hand I love to see the flow between them in TV when they are getting closer to each other (no homo), from other hand I miss two best homies from the books!",

        "body": "Something I don't think I've seen mentioned yet, amidst all the praise and criticisms and actor appreciation threads is the name of our lovely Bard and how it's very distinctly different from what English book read/game players might be familiar with.  \n\n\nIn short, Jaskier is the character's name in Polish (and actually means Buttercup), while Dandelion is the English translation.  \n\n\nAnd... I don't think I'm a fan of them keeping the original. A big part of naming schemes is the meaning behind the names and in some cases it can be lost, but in this case it didn't have to be. Jaskier/Dandelion is a nickname he gave himself (or maybe someone else gave it to him, I'm not sure)  which is all the more reason not to translate it. I can't say for sure WHY he named himself after a flower; maybe cause he's flowery and colourful character, or cause he's pretty to look at, or maybe cause after you take him home he starts getting uglier until you throw him away.  \n\n\nPoint is, when a Polish reader sees \"Jaskier\", they know what it means. When an English reader sees \"Dandelion\", they know what it means. But when an English viewer sees \"Jaskier\", it means nothing to them. They kept the original name, but lost the original meaning, and I think the meaning is more important for this pseudonym.",

        "body": "tl;dr: Nilfgaard armor may look like a wrinkly ballsack, but at least it's lore friendly\n\nThe armor has obviously generated a lot of discussion online, and while I personally am pretty indifferent about it (I think it's fine, not great but not offensive either) I feel the need to defend it's appearance at least insofar as it's faithfulness to Nilfgaardian cultural sensibilities and actual historical precedent. Let me explain: the armor in the show is either leather or metal plate that has been covered with rumpled black silk. This has its roots in the real world: horse racing jockeys and other equestrians sometimes do the same thing for their helmets (albeit much less often nowadays, since elastic silks are cheaper and interchangeable), and rumpled silk was all the rage in 18th and 19th century Europe. In terms of lore, it makes sense that the \"highly cultured\" Nilfgaardians would be in favor of using rich, fashionable materials like silk in their uniforms, and the horse racing precedent would also encourage that, especially in the cavalry. Also, rumpling silk was popular in Europe as a means of conspicuous consumption: folding silk is inefficient, since it takes more material to cover the same surface era, meaning that rumpled silk was a sign of opulence. Again, it makes sense that aristocratic Nilfgaardians would have adopted a similar mentality, which eventually would likely have trickled down to the common troops. Lastly, from a tactical perspective, textured, black matte armor would hold its formal appearance very well through dirt, blood, and damage, certainly better than exposed metal or leather armor. To a Nilfgaardian commander set on preserving a tidy and disciplined appearance, the show's armor would fit the bill very well. All in all, I think that Nilfgaardian armor in the show makes a lot of sense in terms of practicality and plausibility, it just leaves something to be desired aesthetically.",

        "body": "I really loved season one (thank you  so much Lauren and co!) and the Sodden Hill battle in many ways, but one thing I felt like was missing, and that was the fact that there was very little on screen spellcasting done by Tissaia. She is known as such a legendarily powerful mage, and her actress was just perfect imo, she has such an intimidating stare, I almost felt her power just by that :D so in Sodden I kind felt like there was some unreleased buildup with her, I sooo much just wanted her to unleash her magical powers on some poor Nilgaardians and teach them what it's like to cross Tissaia De Vries! And Sodden would have been such a logical place to really hammer in the fact that she is a legendary sorceress who is to be feared. I hope that we get see some of that in the future seasons.\n\nThe same applies somewhat to Vilgefortz as well, but I think that there might be some plot thread going on about his strange behavior during the battle.\n\nDon't get me wrong, generally speaking I think that Sodden was awesome, I liked how creative they were with the spells (it was kinda like chess between the mages of two sides) with the whole repertoire of spells like the fog to provide cover the troops to close up with the northern mages, nerve gas mushrooms, arrows+portal combo, demonic mind control worms for sabotage, the thrown magical cluster bombs, simple break spell to the gate, wall of vines cast by Triss to hold the gate, mass murder spell by Coral, fire nuke by Yennefer etc stuff I may have missed. it almost felt like a DnD mage fight on a large scale, and I really liked that it was not just generic explosions. A very memorable fight.\n\nBut I still wanted to see some absolute on screen badassery by Tissaia, even just one spell, I was almost begging for it to happen :D",

They are messed up in the head (Geralt vs a soldier in Cintra). Cahir is even considered to be a chosen one of some kind, or so is he told by Fringilla. It all feels like a sect. I'm sure the character development of Cahir will be about him realising that this is not the way and trying to change and seeking redemption. Imo we can see by his expression at the end that it is not what he really believes in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a big fan of his character from the books, but I must admit that he wasn't very compelling. I liked the idea of this redemption, the bad guy actually being a bro, but he was actually rather static and boring. What they are doing with him in the show, actually creates massive possibilities of growth and I am sure that we will delve deep into his past. Maybe we will see how he was molded from youg age to be the \"villain\" he is right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hated all of it at first. But it clicked when I realized that they changed Nilfgaardians in the first place. Remember when doppler transformed into Cahir? He asks him \"Do you really believe in this nonsense in your head? This prophecy? We think you're insane!\" I am very intrigued and very happy with this creative liberty they took. What do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nE: Also, Yarpen calls Nilfgaardians zealots and Borch agrees with him in ep6.",

        "title": "Improvements for season 2",
        "body": "The show was great and definitely had its moments. 7.5/10 for me. \n\nBut I want to highlight the problems I had with it - not specific ones, but general ones for the show as a whole to improve moving towards season 2.\n\n1. **The pace was too fast**\n\nThe changes in scene were really abrupt and didn’t flow into each other. Some of the storylines felt very rushed - like the dragon hunt in episode 6 (focused a lot on Yen and Geralt’s relationship and didn’t give enough time to the actual adventure - we didn’t get to emotionally connect with Borch) and the Edge of the World short story in episode 2.  It felt as if the show was juggling between three different stories and chucking them at you at random intervals, without letting each story have enough breathing room. So for season 2 -\n\n***Make sure the story has enough breathing room for the viewer to get immersed and moved by it***.\n\n2. **The characters, characterisation, conflicts and layers of society were too simplified**.\n\nThe showrunner mentioned she doesn’t like dumbing down the story for the audience, which justified the three timelines. But at the same time, some parts of the story that were meant to be thought-provoking with several grey areas were simplified to be black-and-white.\n\nFor example, the conflict between the elves and the humans was portrayed as one-sided - with the humans being bad and the elves being good, and if any moral ambiguity was stated it wasn’t made clear. This isn’t supposed to be the case - the elves aren’t meant to be all good and the humans aren’t meant to be all bad. The Edge of the World story highlighted this, but since it was rushed in the show, it was never explored. \n\nThe portrayal of Nilfgaard was simplified as well. In the show they’re shown to be some sort of religious fanatics and are portrayed to be an all-bad impending force. When Fringilla was describing the positives of Nilfgaard, it was portrayed in a ‘she is a religious fanatic wanting to cleanse the world and liberate the North’ kind of way rather than a ‘these people may actually have a point but we as a viewer have only seen the Northern perspective so we’ve been blindly following them even though we can understand how the Nilfgaardians think’ kind of way. Of course Nilfgaard is still meant to seem dangerous, however.\n\nThe portrayal of Cahir was also underwhelming, but I’m giving the showrunner a chance. Up until this point he’s been shown to be an all-evil kind of guy and we haven’t got any hints of him showing remorse yet. I still believe his complexity may surface soon, but it’d better happen soon otherwise it’s missed potential to show the show’s complexity and depth.\n\nThe character of Borch was also simplified - we didn’t have time to empathise with him. In the Bounds of Reason short story, the conversation between him and Geralt at the beginning really portrayed him to be a thought-provoking and interesting character, but we never got to see that in the show so I didn’t really care for him.\n\nThe dryads of Brokilon’s place in society wasn’t explored well enough in the show as well. In the books they are shown to be ruthless - firing one warning arrow then shooting them dead - whoever tries to enter Brokilon. Even children - they don’t give a shit! They are also very caring about nature, but are very territorial and won’t give up their land for anything. This complexity is just glossed over in the show.\n\nSo, in season 2 -\n\n***Make sure to show each character’s complexity and depth, show that there isn’t black and white in this world, but shades of grey***.\n\n3. **Character development and character arcs weren’t shown well enough**.\n\nTake Geralt for example. You can see he changed in season 1 - from being cold and hiding all his emotions to beginning to open up and deciding to take responsibility for a child. The question is - *how did he get there*?\n\nYou could say what changed is his relationship with Yen, and the discussion about children in episode 6 moved him enough to decide and take responsibility of his own child surprise. But this doesn’t really make sense! Yennefer and Geralt’s relationship, in the show, was made out to be a short-term thing which didn’t really change Geralt’s perspective on things. At the end of episode 6, he was yelling at Yen about deciding to take responsibility for a child in her turbulent life. Then in episode 7 he does that himself! It doesn’t really add up. The threads of character development are there, but they aren’t shown well enough.\n\nIn contrast, in the books Geralt meets Ciri in Brokilon forest, and he doesn’t know at first that she is the child surprise. He grows to like her, and in this short story his development gets justified as he develops an emotional bond with the character. This prompts him to go searching for her, and the reunion in Something More is much more emotional. In the books Geralt’s character development makes sense. In the show it doesn’t. Make sure it always makes sense.\n\nYennefer’s storyline felt rushed as well. One moment she was an abused child, the next moment she was a sassy self-pitying savage. This is too much of a drastic change to occur between two episodes. I didn’t feel for Yennefer because of how abrupt this change was and how whenever the show tried to make us feel bad for Yennefer they cut to a cheery scene with Geralt and Jaskier two seconds afterwards, not allowing us to process and care about this character. This problem could have been solved with more episodes and longer episodes, and a focus for solely Yen in one of the episodes without trying to cram in a short story in there as well. It hurts both storylines. You have to accept that if you want to tell three origin stories in one season you have to make the season longer than 8 episodes, otherwise the show feels way too rushed. \n\nShe was also a lot more self-pitying in the show, and her tantrums were often unjustified. *She chose to lose the capability to have kids, why is she whining about it now*? A solution to this conundrum is that Yennefer isn’t as high-handed and admits she prioritised her looks over her ability to have kids, and she regrets that and wants to make amends. I really hope the showrunner still decides to go down this route, as it would not only explain a plothole, but help us to chisel away at Yennefer’s stony exterior to uncover that she shows remorse for her own actions as well. Also, Yennefer in the books isn’t supposed to be self-pitying and hate society. She’s meant to be too proud for that. Which is why I loved her book portrayal much more than her show one.\n\nThe Ciri storyline was too messy as well. To tell her story, of a sheltered princess being thrust into a world of war, you have to make the development of her adjusting to her world very apparent. There was little to no characterisation - I couldn’t tell you when or how she changed as a person, who she was before and who she was after, even though what she has been through would change someone as a person. All we got was the line ‘then it’s the same as every other place’ in episode 7, and they hoped that we would buy that she changed as a person without us getting any evidence of this happening prior to that moment. \n\nThe showrunner had the right idea, introduce a character called Dara for Ciri to bounce off of. The problem is, Ciri never really opened herself up to Dara and talked her feelings, so we had no idea what was going on in her head. Dara might as well not have existed. The concepts were sound, the execution was shoddy.\n\nCiri’s story also gave off the sense that the writers were just cramming random story beats into it just for the sake of familiarising the viewer with the character. For example, Brokilon Forest and Ciri’s encounter with the dryads really served no purpose to further the story, and the whole ‘doppler assassin fake Mousesack’ concept felt unnecessary too. What did that even accomplish?\n\nA lot of the problems in character arcs were down to time constraints. The showrunner should have recognised this and either made the episodes longer and made 10 episodes instead of 8, let’s say, or changed up her plans for season 1.\n\nJust to throw it out there, in my opinion a more idea direction for season 1 would have been to cut Ciri’s storyline and have her meet Geralt like in the Sword of Destiny short story. It would have given the rest of the show more breathing room, made Geralt’s character arc more coherent, and made the final reunion much more emotional and impactful. \n\nSo, for season 2 -\n\n***Make sure each story beat makes sense and isn’t there for filler. Make sure the character arcs are coherent and allow time for the characters to develop organically and in a meaningful way, don’t expect the viewer to comprehend why the character has changed without showing it***.\n\n4. **Some of the writing was cliché, cringy or implausible. It wasn’t bad, I’m not saying that. But it could have done with improvement in certain areas**.\n\nFor example, how many times was destiny repeated? I get that destiny is a powerful force in the Witcher universe, but damn, if that word didn’t pop up in the most unnecessary places! I also don’t think it believable that people casually talk about there being a ‘vortex of fate surrounding [us], growing with every choice [we] make’. It just sounds like blatant exposition, and detracts from the immersion the viewer feels. \n\nAlso, where was ‘you’re something more’? Maybe it was taken out because it wouldn’t make as much sense without Geralt having met Ciri before in Brokilon Forest, but if so, that’s a shame. It was such a classic moment.\n\nSo, for season 2 -\n\n***Make sure the dialogue is believable, but that’s not to say it can’t be deep. It’s just very important that the viewer doesn’t get pulled out of the world that has been built to marvel at the strangeness of some of the sentences. I know for a fact some people cringed whenever they hear the word ‘destiny’ by the last couple episodes***.\n\n6. **Some technical mistakes**. The CGI wasn’t amazing a lot of the time, like the dragon in episode 6. The editing was odd sometimes, and the cinematography was inconsistent. Some shots were outstanding, some were just OK. The fight scenes were also inconsistent - the one in Blaviken was perfection, but the one in episode 6 was a mess. ^^And ^^the ^^kiss ^^was ^^so ^^cringy. But I’m not too worried about this, since I’m sure these problems will be addressed in season 2. As well as the Nilfgaard armour.\n\n\nLuckily the root cause for a lot of mistakes is the pacing of the first season, and I get why it was fast - they wanted to cram all the setup into the first season. But I really, really do hope season 2 does justice to the Witcher on television, so I wrote this anyway to discuss what I thought should be improved on top of the pacing.",

        "body": "Going into it, I certianly did not expect there to be as many changes, nor did I expect them to be as radical. A LOT was cut and heavily altered. I enjoyed the show for what it is, but I don't think pretty much any of the changes were for the better. A big chunk of exposition was lost, as well as numerous elements and details that really sold the books, in my opinion. Some arcs and/or storylines felt useless (looking at Zara and Brokylon) and abrupt (most of them). A lot of confusion was created, especially for newcomers. Like I said though, I still enjoyed the show and think it had its moments to shine (Renfri, Tissaia, Striga battle, Cavill did very well overall), and the organization became better towards the end.\n\n# To get to the title,\n\nWith the decisions that have been made so far and resulted in very considerable deviations/changes to the plot, the characters, everything, really, I really don't see the direct adaptation (which is now possible due to the official start of the main story) being viable in the future. I doubt >!Geralt will ever sleep with Fringilla , !<for example. They've meddled too much with things for there to be an elegant way to come back. Instead, I think the authors should keep true to the trend of changing things and change A LOT, while retaining the most imporant elements and memorable scenes. This way they have both freedom and backing of the books. It will allow for much more excitement from the people who think they know how everything will play out and can actually play in nicely with what they've already set up, unlike the accurate version. >!I also really hope they get rid of that unnecessary Arthur crap in the Lady of The Lake, if they ever get to that point. !< \n\nI'm not saying ditch the books, but if you started to modify them as much, you might as well keep at it.",

        "title": "The Witcher: Show vs. The Books",
        "body": "http://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-witcher-2019-review.html\n\nThe Witcher is a series that I learned about from CD_Projekt Red the same as many other Western fans. We played the games that were non-canonical Expanded Universe sequels to the books well before the books became available in the English language. I've read those as well and was excited about the Witcher series being based on the original Andzej Sapkoski stories. \n\nHowever, after Game of Thrones, I had the worry that the series would be as schizophrenic as the latter seasons. Very often, television programs invent new stories to fill time for actors and these are often the weakest parts of the story. So is The Witcher any good? Yes, as long as it's following Sapkowski's material. It goes off the rails every time it deviates.\n\nThe premise of the Witcher series is that Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) is a mutant monster-hunter. Witchers are pariahs in society despite their usefulness and must wander from town-to-town, killing for coin. Geralt is an apparent cynic who is actually a frustrated romantic. He hates the cruel, corrupt, and venal Medieval society he lives in. Accompanying him on his adventures is Jaskier (Joey Batey) who is a bard that has decided to latch onto Geralt in order to make his legend (as well as Geralt's). \n\nIn addition to Geralt's adventures with Jaskier, there is the story of Yennefer of Vengerburg (Anya Chalotra) who is a deformed young woman who discovers immortality and power at the mere cost of the life she could have had before. Rounding out the protagonists is Ciri of Cintra (Freya Allan), a young princess who witnesses the extermination of her kingdom and finds that her family was hated as tyrants. \n\nThe first season is a rough approximation of the first two Witcher short story collections, The Last Witch and The Sword of Destiny. The parts that star Geralt are the best parts of the series and the most faithful to the original stories. They adapt \"The Lesser Evil\", \"The Edge of the World\", \"The Witcher\", \"A Question of Price\", \"The Last Wish\", \"The Bounds of Reason\", and \"Something More\" quite well. The only story that gets mutilated is \"The Sword of Destiny\" (the story not the collection) where Geralt was a major player but doesn't even show up.\n\nThe biggest alterations are expanding on Yennefer's backstory and giving a completely new series of adventures for Ciri to engage in. In the Witcher short stories, it's mentioned that Yennefer was a deformed young girl that had her body repaired by the Brotherhood of Sorcerers only for her to be sterialized by her mentor Tissaia (MyAnna Buring). She spends decades after mourning the lack of a chance to be a mother and working to discover a way to achieve it. \n\nHere, we see her sterialization is a result of her magical plastic surgery and it undermines the character of Tissaia a bit. In the books, she believes in the supremacy of magic above all things and that women should not be distracted by mundane concerns like family (showing her internalized misogyny and callousness). \n\nTissaia is also shown to be leading the resistance against Nilfgaard, which is the opposite of her book persona where she believes mortal governments are another distraction from the brotherhood of mages (that no other mage subscribes to). Yennefer also seems more ambiguous about her desire to be a mother, which seems like it's an attempt to not make her seem weak but actually achieves the opposite of making her not know her own mind. Yennefer is many things but indecisive is never one of them.\n\nThere's also a weird attempt to grimdark up some of the stories. The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny are somewhat humorous stories despite seriously dark moments. The show adds some horrible villainy to characters like Calanthe (Jodhi May). She's inexplicably shown to be engaging in pogroms of elves for no reason. We also have the Brotherhood of Sorcerers turning failed candidates into eels.\n\nCiri's adventures are the weakest part of the narrative as she basically wanders from tent to forest to tent to forest on a pointless joirney that tells us very little about either her character or her relationship with her mother. We see none of the snarky young badass-in-training that we'll see in the later books. Basically, she's an obnoxious child and that makes her much more entertaining than the mostly silent one we meet here.\n\nHenry Cavill does a surprisingly good job as Geralt and I admit this is probably my favorite role of his. He seems to basically go between channeling Clint Eastwood and Doug Cockle (the game's Witcher) but the Man with No Name was the inspiration for Geralt anyway while the other is well-beloved by gamers. I never quite completely bought him as the character but he did at least achieve the \"famous actor I recognize doing the character I like\" that Tom Cruise and Lestat did.

        "body": "http://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-witcher-2019-review.html\n\nThe Witcher is a series that I learned about from CD_Projekt Red the same as many other Western fans. We played the games that were non-canonical Expanded Universe sequels to the books well before the books became available in the English language. I've read those as well and was excited about the Witcher series being based on the original Andzej Sapkoski stories. \n\nHowever, after Game of Thrones, I had the worry that the series would be as schizophrenic as the latter seasons. Very often, television programs invent new stories to fill time for actors and these are often the weakest parts of the story. So is The Witcher any good? Yes, as long as it's following Sapkowski's material. It goes off the rails every time it deviates.\n\nThe premise of the Witcher series is that Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) is a mutant monster-hunter. Witchers are pariahs in society despite their usefulness and must wander from town-to-town, killing for coin. Geralt is an apparent cynic who is actually a frustrated romantic. He hates the cruel, corrupt, and venal Medieval society he lives in. Accompanying him on his adventures is Jaskier (Joey Batey) who is a bard that has decided to latch onto Geralt in order to make his legend (as well as Geralt's). \n\nIn addition to Geralt's adventures with Jaskier, there is the story of Yennefer of Vengerburg (Anya Chalotra) who is a deformed young woman who discovers immortality and power at the mere cost of the life she could have had before. Rounding out the protagonists is Ciri of Cintra (Freya Allan), a young princess who witnesses the extermination of her kingdom and finds that her family was hated as tyrants. \n\nThe first season is a rough approximation of the first two Witcher short story collections, The Last Witch and The Sword of Destiny. The parts that star Geralt are the best parts of the series and the most faithful to the original stories. They adapt \"The Lesser Evil\", \"The Edge of the World\", \"The Witcher\", \"A Question of Price\", \"The Last Wish\", \"The Bounds of Reason\", and \"Something More\" quite well. The only story that gets mutilated is \"The Sword of Destiny\" (the story not the collection) where Geralt was a major player but doesn't even show up.\n\nThe biggest alterations are expanding on Yennefer's backstory and giving a completely new series of adventures for Ciri to engage in. In the Witcher short stories, it's mentioned that Yennefer was a deformed young girl that had her body repaired by the Brotherhood of Sorcerers only for her to be sterialized by her mentor Tissaia (MyAnna Buring). She spends decades after mourning the lack of a chance to be a mother and working to discover a way to achieve it. \n\nHere, we see her sterialization is a result of her magical plastic surgery and it undermines the character of Tissaia a bit. In the books, she believes in the supremacy of magic above all things and that women should not be distracted by mundane concerns like family (showing her internalized misogyny and callousness). \n\nTissaia is also shown to be leading the resistance against Nilfgaard, which is the opposite of her book persona where she believes mortal governments are another distraction from the brotherhood of mages (that no other mage subscribes to). Yennefer also seems more ambiguous about her desire to be a mother, which seems like it's an attempt to not make her seem weak but actually achieves the opposite of making her not know her own mind. Yennefer is many things but indecisive is never one of them.\n\nThere's also a weird attempt to grimdark up some of the stories. The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny are somewhat humorous stories despite seriously dark moments. The show adds some horrible villainy to characters like Calanthe (Jodhi May). She's inexplicably shown to be engaging in pogroms of elves for no reason. We also have the Brotherhood of Sorcerers turning failed candidates into eels.\n\nCiri's adventures are the weakest part of the narrative as she basically wanders from tent to forest to tent to forest on a pointless joirney that tells us very little about either her character or her relationship with her mother. We see none of the snarky young badass-in-training that we'll see in the later books. Basically, she's an obnoxious child and that makes her much more entertaining than the mostly silent one we meet here.\n\nHenry Cavill does a surprisingly good job as Geralt and I admit this is probably my favorite role of his. He seems to basically go between channeling Clint Eastwood and Doug Cockle (the game's Witcher) but the Man with No Name was the inspiration for Geralt anyway while the other is well-beloved by gamers. I never quite completely bought him as the character but he did at least achieve the \"famous actor I recognize doing the character I like\" that Tom Cruise and Lestat did.

It goes off the rails every time it deviates.\n\nThe premise of the Witcher series is that Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) is a mutant monster-hunter. Witchers are pariahs in society despite their usefulness and must wander from town-to-town, killing for coin. Geralt is an apparent cynic who is actually a frustrated romantic. He hates the cruel, corrupt, and venal Medieval society he lives in. Accompanying him on his adventures is Jaskier (Joey Batey) who is a bard that has decided to latch onto Geralt in order to make his legend (as well as Geralt's). \n\nIn addition to Geralt's adventures with Jaskier, there is the story of Yennefer of Vengerburg (Anya Chalotra) who is a deformed young woman who discovers immortality and power at the mere cost of the life she could have had before. Rounding out the protagonists is Ciri of Cintra (Freya Allan), a young princess who witnesses the extermination of her kingdom and finds that her family was hated as tyrants. \n\nThe first season is a rough approximation of the first two Witcher short story collections, The Last Witch and The Sword of Destiny. The parts that star Geralt are the best parts of the series and the most faithful to the original stories. They adapt \"The Lesser Evil\", \"The Edge of the World\", \"The Witcher\", \"A Question of Price\", \"The Last Wish\", \"The Bounds of Reason\", and \"Something More\" quite well. The only story that gets mutilated is \"The Sword of Destiny\" (the story not the collection) where Geralt was a major player but doesn't even show up.\n\nThe biggest alterations are expanding on Yennefer's backstory and giving a completely new series of adventures for Ciri to engage in. In the Witcher short stories, it's mentioned that Yennefer was a deformed young girl that had her body repaired by the Brotherhood of Sorcerers only for her to be sterialized by her mentor Tissaia (MyAnna Buring). She spends decades after mourning the lack of a chance to be a mother and working to discover a way to achieve it. \n\nHere, we see her sterialization is a result of her magical plastic surgery and it undermines the character of Tissaia a bit. In the books, she believes in the supremacy of magic above all things and that women should not be distracted by mundane concerns like family (showing her internalized misogyny and callousness). \n\nTissaia is also shown to be leading the resistance against Nilfgaard, which is the opposite of her book persona where she believes mortal governments are another distraction from the brotherhood of mages (that no other mage subscribes to). Yennefer also seems more ambiguous about her desire to be a mother, which seems like it's an attempt to not make her seem weak but actually achieves the opposite of making her not know her own mind. Yennefer is many things but indecisive is never one of them.\n\nThere's also a weird attempt to grimdark up some of the stories. The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny are somewhat humorous stories despite seriously dark moments. The show adds some horrible villainy to characters like Calanthe (Jodhi May). She's inexplicably shown to be engaging in pogroms of elves for no reason. We also have the Brotherhood of Sorcerers turning failed candidates into eels.\n\nCiri's adventures are the weakest part of the narrative as she basically wanders from tent to forest to tent to forest on a pointless joirney that tells us very little about either her character or her relationship with her mother. We see none of the snarky young badass-in-training that we'll see in the later books. Basically, she's an obnoxious child and that makes her much more entertaining than the mostly silent one we meet here.\n\nHenry Cavill does a surprisingly good job as Geralt and I admit this is probably my favorite role of his. He seems to basically go between channeling Clint Eastwood and Doug Cockle (the game's Witcher) but the Man with No Name was the inspiration for Geralt anyway while the other is well-beloved by gamers. I never quite completely bought him as the character but he did at least achieve the \"famous actor I recognize doing the character I like\" that Tom Cruise and Lestat did. I was entertained and enjoyed his work greatly.\n\nAnya Chalotra's Yennefer was exceptional and despite the fact her original material was weaker than Geralt's stories, I felt she did an excellent job. So much so that I felt that were this an original series, I'd still be watching it for her. She's also a great beauty and while the sheer amount of nudity on display is gratituous (she seems like to casting spells topless for some reason), its a small distraction from serious acting chops. I've seen some people complain about the fact a biracial woman was cast in the role but phooey on them.\n\nThe action is good, the special effects are excellent, and the writing (the original writing that is) is great. It's just when they color outside of the lines of Sapkowski's original work that I think the show suffers. Sapkowski may not be for everyone but I feel like a bit more fidelity would have made this even better. Even it meant we'd meet Yennefer and Ciri later.",

This will be a brief review on the important elements of episode.\n\nNO MAJOR SPOILERS\n\nWe are introduced to two major characters as well as a few minor characters. Major characters being  Geralt of Rivia and Princess Cirilla of Cintra. Henry’s performance of Geralt was beautifuly portrayed. Henry displays Geralt’s tough, hard-exterior side very well; It’s quite seamless. He absolutely nails Geralt’s rough, metallic-like voice as well. Freya, on the other hand, portrays Cirilla’s natural, rebellious charm. I had no complaints on their acting; absolutely masterful. \n\nIn the beginning of the episode, we are introduced to Stregebor, a sorcerer in hiding. He asks Geralt to kill a woman who wants to kill him. Geralt declines and goes on his way. Later in the story, the woman named Renfri seeks out Geralt and offers him an ultimatum. Their conversation is very deep and full of emotion. The entire story is poetically intriguing and for the most part well done. However, I have to point out that a few parts in the story are rushed and arn’t well paced. Specifically, towards the end of the story when Geralt speaks with Renfri, there wasn’t a lot of development in regards to the story; it felt pretty rushed and doesn’t give audience time to prepare for the next story arc. However, Geralt’s character goes on a major arc that keeps us emotionally attached to him towards the end. Ciri’s story on the other hand, starts when we see the rebellious side of Ciri, where she disregards her part as princess and plays with the peasant boys in the local village in disguise. We are then properly introduced to Princess Cirilla and her beautiful eyes. We are also introduced to Queen Calanthe of Cintra and Sir Eist. Later in the story, a knight whispers to Calanthe of the arrival of Nilfgaard, a savage army from the South who seeks to destroy Cintra. Upon hearing this, Calanthe becomes dreadful. This is where it gets a little weird. This scene transitions to a sudden battle with Nilfgaard which is very confusing given that there is no development leading to the battle. It feels as if a big chunk is missing. I find it important for there to be a few scenes that show us the preparation prior to the war with Nilfgaard, but they seemed to rush the story again. While there is a definite pacing issue in this story, we see the true beauty of this show towards the ending; The Poetic Justice. We witness the absolute tragedies that take place as a result of the Nilfgaard invasion. There are major character arcs that take place towards the end. People will definitely develop an emotional attachment to these characters based on the decisions and outcomes of the story. All in all, while there are some pacing issues, the poetry mixed with the great characters mixed with the intriguing individual stories, tells a complex and beautifully deep story. My only major complaint is that this show needs to better explain the lore and world of The Witcher Universe. I can see how a non-book reader may become confused because there’s so much context in this first episode; it can can get pretty overwhelming at times. Better pacing and better explanation of the story is all that’s needed for this episode. Aside from that, this episode hits the ballpark for me.\n\nMusic was beautiful and emotional. They are especially grand during character introductions.\n\nI was impressed with everybody’s portrayal of the characters; it was absolutely fantastic to see. Every character has a complex set of ideals and this compels is to make an emotional attachment them.\n\nI had a few problems with the CGI being a little too unrealistic at moments. In particular, the beginning when Geralt walks through the illusory wall and also the Kikimora at the beginning; it looked really cheap in my opinion. \n\nVerdict: If you can disregard the moments of pacing issues and somewhat rushed moments in the stories, you will see that this story is full of complex characters with intriguing storylines that are unparalleled in television. I advise if you havn’t read the books and are confused(which I know can happen at times) give it some time and pace yourself.\n\nOut of 10 points, I give this episode a solid 8/10. \n\nThanks for reading and hope to see you what you guys think.",

        "title": "A serious attempt to share my thoughts/criticism on the Netflix series as a big witcher-games fan - I hope you read this Netflix!",
        "body": "Hi,\n\ni joined the witcher cult with its second itteration of the video games series, the witcher 2. Since then i consider myself a big fan of the games and the lore behind it, even though i never read the books (just not a big reader ..). So my thoughts are mainly based on the lore that gets carried through the game series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood:\n\n\\- **finally a tv series worth my netflix account**\n\n**- good cast overall, especially yesker and yarpen are just phenomenal**\n\n**- fan service to the gamers with little quotes here and there**\n\n\\- **first swordfight in blevic, great choreography and cinematography**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeutral:\n\n\\- **Henry cavills portraition of Geralt** isnt quite fitting. I think henry is a great actor and he is def. persuing the idea of his witcher. To me tho, he is just too bulky and bloated. The witcher in the games is just a very muscular, lean man, you can see what he is doing for his living, fighting big monsters and other evil creatures (humans \\^\\^), being in the woods for days and weeks, having to starve from time to time, poisening yourself constantly. His whole body just shows that that harsh life. Cavill in his current shape, just looks like your ordinary muscular big guy, that hits the gym 6 days a week and has a proper diet (meaning no shortage of food) all the time. So henry, if you read this, lose some pounds, get more shredded.\n\nAlso he is not quite there for me on a mental pov. Geralt isnt a man of many words, but when he speaks he is very precise, efficent and gets straight to the point. Keeping hes cool most of the times. In the series, he is way to \"hulky\" and aggressiv and therefore doesnt seem very intellegent (which he is). Again henry, tone it down a notch, and replace aggression with cunningness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBad:\n\n\\- **lacks depth and scale** (which is shame considering the base material is richer than GoT). If you wanna show a big clash of two armies, go all out and sho us two armies, not just 50 man on the screen in a panning shot. You ever walked through novigrad in the game? Dont give us the same equally looking houses and streets and citizens every time something plays in a city/village. There is no sense of authentisim (yet) if you combine the points above and the mediocre costumes of the ordinary crowd. Way too clean, way to freshly made looking, doesnt fit in the slavish culture where the books and the game is based of.\n\n\\- **Triss merigold** (just my opinion folks, put your forks back ..) absolutely not a fan of her casting\n\n\\- fights become unexciting and boring over the curse of the show (remember where you started in blevic ..). Everyone after the sloughter of blevic knows of the while wolf, knows what he is capable of, still they all going into fighting geralt like \"ah ill be fine\". You should feel the tension and the fear of someone has to face geralt and knows he is prob. about to die. Use your bullettime moments from the first time fighting rarely and intellegent, every fight after blevic is just a letdown. Show us how incridble fearsome and deadly Geralt is every time he has to fight. Normal soldiers would als consider to just flee after seeing some of the people just got slaughtered. This feeling, that Geralt of Rivia is someone you shouldnt mess around, is mostly missing in later episodes.\n\n\\- **time jumps** back and forth all over the place. We as gamers can handle it, but not your average guy, that just wants to know what this new witcher series is all about.\n\n\\- lack of explaination/introduction to the world of the witcher to the unaware viewer\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to fix the series and make it more appealing to a wider audience**\n\nSo we all get more content, since thats what we all can agree upon right?!\n\n\\- go big with your investments, you dont have to be scared of GoT, you have a way better basis here, you just need to present it in a more deserving way. This story deserves to get all the money, all the time and all the attention to detail you can get!\n\n\\- make timejumps more distinguishable by either adding a ordinary timestamp (lazy but easy) or, make it like the big boys, and just let the whole enviroment tell you \"Ok guys, this is that time, and this is that time\" by altering geralts appearance (mustache, hair, his ARMOR FFS!!!!, scars in the face) + sidecharacteres.\n\n\\- explain what a witcher is, in what world he is living it etc. Use short throwbacks, how geralt had to prevail himself in kaer morhan, how he learned his handsigns, how he lost some of his is childhood friends during the process of becoming a witcher\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If Netflix cant change the series for the better, it soon will be canceled. We, the fans of the games and the books, are just not enough to provide the neccessary demand on the show for Netflix to continue it. The show has to grow, mature and learn really fast from its first season in order to convince more average joes that this series is actually worth their time and money.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm looking forward to have a great discussion with you guys, im not gonna react to pure fanboys and haters of anything that comes close to their holy gral. Netflix needs our imput, so lets try to give them quality imput.",

One of my main fears of the show was that Henry was going to be leaps and bounds above all the other actors and actresses. Then Jaskier appears.\n\nJoey Batey clearly matched Henry in his love for the character. There on screen chemistry is the likes of Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson. Much like Henry, Joey clearly understood the sourse material and sought to incorporate it into every moment of every scene. His character I think had a much higher chance of being done wrong. Geralt is a man of few words, in all the sourse material. Dandelion/Jaskier is most certainly not a man of few words. He very easily could have come off as annoying instead of headstrong and confident, a lecher instead of a romantic. In fact it is the balancing act between these things that make the character and Batey nails it at every opportunity. In fact the limited on screen time the two of them have together is one of my biggest gripes with the series as a whole. That's mostly due to how amazing they are together.\n\nHats off to both men for bringing my most loved fantasy universe to live action in what I consider to be one of the best video game/book to show translations. \n\nToss a coin to your witcher.",

        "title": "Full Season 1 Fan reviews - post them here ! [TV and Book Spoilers]",
        "body": "Hey there,\n\nFirst things first, let me say thanks to all the great people participating around here and making this place lively. \n\nI've been reading for months and now felt like a proper time to participate a bit.\n\nNow that quite a few of us have watched the season, I tought It would be a good moment to share our respective opinions about the whole thing. \n\nCareful, there are many spoilers ahead which i've done my best to tag. \n\nI really think i need to lay things down to be able to better process it, so here are my humble thoughts about it:\n\n**The Pros :**\n\n\\- The main cast was really good, I trusted Henry to nail it and not only he did that but also exceeded my expectations, but so did Anya, Joey and even Freya\n\n\\- Some of the secondary cast was above expectations too : Stregobor, Renfri, Tissaia and even Borch were great, loved Yurga and Visenna too\n\n\\- The music was fantastic throughout and i think i would have liked it to be even more present. Gian, Sonia and the rest of musician/singers (Declan included) really did an outstanding job. I would have loved to hear it more often and probably slightly louder at times\n\n\\- The fighting scenes with Geralt went from awesome (Blaviken, The Banquet, Striga fight) to great but overall left a solid impression. Blaviken is the single best medieval type sword fight I can remember ever watching\n\n\\- A fair bit of funny moments. Some critics said it doesn’t fit the overall tone, but I disagree with that in most cases\n\n\\- Yennefer story arc was surprisingly well written and interesting while being original \n\n\\- The interactions between Geralt and Jaskier and Yennefer and Geralt worked great for the most part \n\n\\- Some of the costumes and sets were really nice (Cintrian Thrones Room, Aretuza, Tissaia and Yen wardrobes, Renfri’s outfit), the rest was from good to meh\n\n**The serious issues :**\n\n\\- The exaggerated number of mentions of Destiny. I felt that this pushed down my throat really hard. The fact that a number of characters with some sort of a magic connection, like Renfri, would mention it is fine, and does help give a sense of overarching plot. The number of occurrence is ridiculous though, sometimes out of place, and ended up being cringy. The task to connect everything was dauting I’m sure, but that was a miss\n\n\\- The complete Ciri’s arc, >!apart from scenes and Cintra and maybe with Yurga’s wife brought little to the show overall, and felt like precious time lost. Brokilon was the worst of it (Also why did they make Dara drink the waters, he is a male?) and the first meeting with Geralt was desperately missing to create a more emotional final reunion. Freya saved it a bit with her performance, and I understand Lauren idea to show Ciri ahead of the meeting, but frankly more was told about her character in the Brokilon chapter from the book than in her entire arc this season, stealing some much needed time from Geralt and the short stories!<\n\n\\- Some key elements of short stories were entirely lost, most importantly: \n\no The lesser evil: >!the whole ultimatum thing was unclear, and it was not understandable that Renfri planned to make a massacre if Stregobor didn’t come out. Which resulted in Geralt looking like the bad guy. It could have took less than a minute of dialogue to fix this!<\n\no Bounds of reason: >!Borch was nicely casted, loved his voice. But so many great exchanges between him and Geralt were lost.. I get that they couldn’t show the dragons for too long, so I’m ok with the action part being different that the book, but dialogues could have used some love. All the lines of Jaskier trying to bang the Zerrikanians were lame, might as well get rid of those.!<\n\no The whole Dol Blathanna part, while having some super funny scenes and dialogues lost some much of its essence on the way. The place never felt like a valley of plenty on the screen anyways. I think i would have rather they kept it for later. A bigger elven role would make sense in season 2 >!(To make the link with shaerrawedd and the Scoia'tael) Here it contributed little to the main arc and didn’t do justice to the short story!<\n\n\\- Too little time for dialogues: it is directly linked with the previous point. This show was really missing some more lengthy exchange between characters for the sake of a lot of unnecessary action (looking at you Ciri). >!The final battle dragged on with little at stake for the audience (2 main characters not involved) and a clear lack of budget to make the battle really epic.!<\n\n\\- Some characters were shadows of their book counterparts : \n\no Cahir : >!it started good in episode one : the hunt for Ciri in Cintra, his scared face when Ciri opened the ground with her power. And then he looked more and more like an actual badass Nilgardian General rather than the young officer doubting the morality of his task that he is supposed to be. There is a real chance to get this fixed, so let’s hope Lauren and writers can, because Eamon, while not being like what most people would probably expect Cahir to look like, is a damn great actor no doubt!<\n\no VilgeFortz : >!at this point, he is not yet recognized as super powerful, but he should be already very strong, and have his recognizable proudness and strength of character. He was laughed at by the council of mages and there was no focus on his reaction. And then he just got ass kicked by Cahir (and please don’t tell me he was pretending, people don’t willingly pass out..). This was a terrible introduction of an amazing character than the show has a chance to flesh out. His entry seems completely failed. How will he become a respected powerhouse inside of the Brotherhood (Mage council) if he is not the Hero of Sodden Hill ? I have no idea how this can be fixed, but let’s hope.. While I understand the necessity to show Yen as really powerful and give her an ultimate shine moment, there was room for both no doubt. There we have Yen looking overpowered and Vilg looking underpowered!<\n\no Triss, between the bland acting, average lines and >!absolutely unepic attempt at gate defense (she blocked 5 guys tops with a couple roots, WHOAA), the whole character was rather lame!<\n\no Eyck of Denesle : >!from badass and pompous knight to unfunny moron serving for a fart joke. And he ended up dead in a bush showing his bare ass. Overplayed moronic characters are annoying, and just don’t bring anything valuable to the show!<\n\no Yarpen Zigrin : >!did he really need to be so pointlessly noisy and aggressive ? That felt excessive and out of place. A great cast served with terrible directions!<\n\n\\- Nilfgaard >!being mostly depicted as some evil fanatic empire: it really lacked some nuance, there is a mention somewhere that they are not so bad but the impression left by the rest is different!<\n\n\\- Sodden and the use of magic. Frankly this is what ruined the final for me. There was no clear or somewhat clear notion of the power scale between mages, >!apart from Yen being super powerful. For a while I thought Coral would remain the most badass after her massive neck breaking moment. I understand that breaking necks with telekinesis is less costly to represent than fireballs, but it basically makes any confrontation between a normal human and a mage a no match. Which could be fine really, if Cahir vs Vilg hadn’t happened. Any comprehension you could have of power scale was lost there, while it really is needed to an extent at least. The whole “sacrificing magic” from Nilfgaard felt uncessary and out of place, and solidified the “evil empire of doom” impression. Who would waste the life of a precious mage for just one spell ? Either make the spell a lot more powerful, either have them send several before dying. No general in his right mind would do that.!<\n\n\\- The quality of directing and cinematography was very uneven. The management of light for example differed too much from one episode to an another, going from grim to color saturated. >!Oh and those halogen lights in Brokilon, that was weird. The episodes shot by Alex Garcia Lopez outshined the rest by far when it comes to directing!<\n\n\\- CGI : from great to lame depending on episodes and shots. >!How could Aretuza, Cintra and most spells and signs look so good while the dragons were under average at best ? That snow effect from episode 3 was lame too, why include it if it’s ugly? !<\n\n**Minor grips :** \n\n\\- Excessive nudity for ladies. Why have 7 naked girls at Stregobor’s house instead of 1? Poor anya suffered way too much from this with more than 2 minutes of visible breast while Henry did not even show any bare ass, which a lot of ladies watching would have surely enjoyed, even a glimpse (Quote: my wife). It feels unfair, especially coming from a team with so many women in charge !!! \n\n\\- >!The use of Dimeritium against Tissaia : why not, but what it is and its effect is never explained leaving viewers confused!<\n\n\\- Medieval warfare : \n\no What exactly was Nilfgaard trying to achieve by >!shooting arrows at the door of the Keep of Cintra ? (with lazer sounds and effects btw..)\n\no >!The door of the Sodden Keep looked like swords could have got through it because it was so weak, and nobody even tried to barricade the damn thing !<\n\n\\- >!That kiss during the fight in front of the Dragon Cavern in ep.6 belongs in another show (Xena?). Please, we deserve better than this nonsense. It’s unbelievable that this would happen in the same world of ep.1.!< \n\n\\- >!Sorceresses were taught to capture thunder but never used it once in Battle, while it is one of the very few spells that Sapkowski actually talks about in the books!<\n\n**Things that remain to be seen in the future but I’m really feeling shared about :**\n\n\\- Fringilla : might as well have a made an original character out her, which would have avoided controversy over the casting too. They have a given her a much bigger role, which is fine I guess, but I fail to see how >!she will ever become the Fringilla of books when the show reaches Toussaint.!< Let’s see\n\n\\- Yennefer : this season she was great, but her presence in the book goes progressively down as time passes. Where will she fit in the show then? I feel like the writers will have to write her many more original scenes because of the place she was given at the start. This will differ greatly from the book, which is always a risky ground\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nOverall, it’s a 7,5/10 for me, and that’s mostly thanks to the cast and the music. Still very much looking forward to season 2, and hoping it will be packed with improvements. \n\nI’ve never in my entire life felt so shared about a TV Show, i usually rather like them or really dislike them, but this one is such max bag of great, not so great and almost terrible at times.\n\nThe quality of edition, special effects and just about everything was so uneven that I wondered if I was still watching the same show. I felt like the production had to rush in quite a few moments. \n\nAs much as i think that the production can progress on editing, shooting, sets and special effects, I’m a bit more worried about the writing. Season 2 and its single timeline should be easier, but there is a LOT to improve.\n\nFingers crossed, i want to believe they can and will do better :D \n\nRating per episode:\n\no The end's beginning : 8/10 some really important bits of the lesser evil went missing, the rest was top notch\n\no Four Marks : 7/10 It was great episode that lacked 10-15 more minutes to tell the short story properly, while the bits included were good. It was saved by the Yennefer arc and fun lines\n\no Betrayer Moon : 8,5/10 the best on many accounts, because the short story had sufficient time to develop and the cinematography was top notch\n\no  Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials  : 8/10 solid, >! but the whole flying Pavetta thing lasted way too long and was weird and the CGI didn’t help… Brokilon didn’t work at all : nothing was clear or felt like there some proper stakes!<\n\no  Bottled Appetites : 7/10 the introduction of the episode was off :  >!a Djin to fix sleep problems really ? and the lines of Jaskier were not funny either. The start of the story in the books was vastly superior. The bath lacked a more sexually ambitious Geralt and sexual tension!<\n\no  Rare Species  : 7/10 (oo much good dialogues cut out, it lost a lot of its essence and both Eyck and Yarpen I wanted to slap\n\no  Before a Fall  : 6,5/10 >!the whole Geralt in Cintra thing felt pointless in my humble opinion!<\n\no  Much More  : 5/10 >!Sodden was a complete mess and the whole thing lacked some emotional weight/tension. It should have been more condensed and more focus on the actual use of a magic. It entirely lacked the gory / horrifying descriptions of dismembered bodies from the book. Magic was suppose to be shown with all the horror it can create.  The Vilgefortz vs Cahir sequence is an unforgivable slap in the face of the books and logic around the use of magic. Had Cahir not been the general, it could have been a great idea to show Vilg decimate the general and his guards and the panic that would follow as a turning point of the Battle. The parts with Geralt or Ciri were from good to OK. The whole fever sequence and Visenna was spot on though!<",

        "body": "(SHOW SPOILERS BELOW)\n\nI feel like we were given fairly little info on what seems to be the main conflict of the show. There's clearly a huge war underway in this world, with the kingdom of Nilfgaard having gone beserk with religious zealotry and attempting to conquer the rest of the continent. We don't really know what the White Flame is or what its extremist followers want, but we get a few hints of their grievances and goals:\n\n1. They want to possess Princess Cirilla because she has some unknown great magical value.\n2. They believe the leaders of other kingdoms and the brotherhood of sorcerers are corrupt.\n3. They do not believe any types of magic should be restricted or considered \"dark\" (such as necromancy, fire magic, etc.).\n4. They believe they are \"saving\" the continent through their campaign of war.\n5. IIRC, they have been collecting (and basically enslaving?) mages as they find them.\n6. They seem to purposefully extinguish all civilian life even after a kingdom's army has been defeated and all defenses breached (if what they did to Cintra is what they do to all places they conquer).\n\nSo...what are they actually doing here? What are they trying to \"save\" (as they state they believe they are) if they're massacring everyone and leaving no people to even rule or convert? From their perspective, what does the continent/world need saving from? Does it connect to the whole \"women of Lilit\" thing introduced in the first episode? Because that seemed to end up not having anything to do with anything when it was wrapped up so early (with Renfri apparently being the last threat of those eclipse babies and then being killed). But Ciri is also a princess with apparently dark & mysterious capabilities so is she tied to it as well even though she wasn't born with the rest of that batch?\n\n**Btw, please keep this discussion to the show.** I haven't read the books and am trying to piece together what the full season so far is laying down.",

        "body": "  \n\nI wasn’t expecting more from Netflix in the first place and with the quality of the books and the games combined, they was a big challenge here. And before people jump on me with the usual “it’s an adaptation not a copy-past of the book” I will criticize it as an adaptation. Notice that the games (especially the third one are also an adaptations of the books and they did the “adaptation” part right compare to the Netflix series).\n\nA thing they did as a start in this series is to rely heavily on the fam of the Witcher which resulted in rushed scene and unexplained lore. Way too often I was under the impression that the series was getting into something for a split of second while telling me “Look, you recognize this from the books! No need for explanation, let’s move on!” or the way the series pushes Geralt’s fam using Jaskier song and other people reaction like “Look it’s the Witcher! You know him from the famous games and famous books!” I didn’t feel like the series was actually introducing characters and concept before adding the fam. As for the rest, I didn’t recognize the atmosphere of the Witcher but it felt more like your generic fantasy show with dialogs that were often clichés or over the top.\n\nIn my opinion, the casting and the writing of the characters are awful. I was hoping that they would at least make Geralt’s personality a bit similar to the personality he has in the books but they decided to go with the cool dark guy that travels on the roads instead of showing a man who struggles both with monsters and with the dishonesty of people he helps.\n\nWhile it was a good idea to show how Yennefer become the powerful witch that she is, it felt once again rushed and when we finally get to see the present Yennefer, she doesn’t seem to be Yennefer at all. She’s more like your generic bitchy witch that seems to be lost in many scenes, whiny, lacking maturity and charisma. As for Triss, I couldn’t make the difference between her personality and Yenn’s. Cheap contact lenses for Yenn and cheap hair, I know beauty is different for everyone but I cringed a bit at the scene when Yenn appear in front of everyone without her deformity like “Look how beautiful I am now!” I was like “Not really but ok…” For Triss they should have cast a younger actress or at least do something with her hair.\n\nJaskier is unbearable, cliché comic relief without the nobility and education that he has in the books that explain why he has such a big mouth. And they could have at least made some effort to make him look like a bard and not some random peasant with a lute.\n\nBut the worst of the worst is Ciri. She’s a total Mary-Sue with no personality, deus ex machina super power to get her out of difficult situations, can walk into Brokilon without any problem, everyone except the bad guys help her even if they don’t know her and the cherry on the top “You are super special” line by almost everyone…  And the weird scene in the last episode of the season when she meets Geralt and they both jump into each other arms despite the fact that they never met each other before in the series.\n\nOther details such as the situation of the elves are not explained, the Dryades are a joke. I don’t know why they went for the cliché of the nice women tribe of savages instead of showing dangerous non-human creatures who have their own problems with the conflicts of the current time in this universe. Oh and the big scene with all the corpses near the forest and five minutes later Moussack arrives like “Don’t shoot please” and they are like “Ok”. This is ridiculous.\n\nPolitics and why conflict happened are not explained, why the Nilfgaardian want Ciri was turned into this “Because she’s very special with her super power” instead of a simple political reason. And I can’t believe they kept this awful armour design for the Nilfgaardians.",

Cheap contact lenses for Yenn and cheap hair, I know beauty is different for everyone but I cringed a bit at the scene when Yenn appear in front of everyone without her deformity like “Look how beautiful I am now!” I was like “Not really but ok…” For Triss they should have cast a younger actress or at least do something with her hair.\n\nJaskier is unbearable, cliché comic relief without the nobility and education that he has in the books that explain why he has such a big mouth. And they could have at least made some effort to make him look like a bard and not some random peasant with a lute.\n\nBut the worst of the worst is Ciri. She’s a total Mary-Sue with no personality, deus ex machina super power to get her out of difficult situations, can walk into Brokilon without any problem, everyone except the bad guys help her even if they don’t know her and the cherry on the top “You are super special” line by almost everyone…  And the weird scene in the last episode of the season when she meets Geralt and they both jump into each other arms despite the fact that they never met each other before in the series.\n\nOther details such as the situation of the elves are not explained, the Dryades are a joke. I don’t know why they went for the cliché of the nice women tribe of savages instead of showing dangerous non-human creatures who have their own problems with the conflicts of the current time in this universe. Oh and the big scene with all the corpses near the forest and five minutes later Moussack arrives like “Don’t shoot please” and they are like “Ok”. This is ridiculous.\n\nPolitics and why conflict happened are not explained, why the Nilfgaardian want Ciri was turned into this “Because she’s very special with her super power” instead of a simple political reason. And I can’t believe they kept this awful armour design for the Nilfgaardians.",

She had immense power that she struggled to control, whereas the three that didn't make the cut just didn't have the chops at all. It could have been explained a little more clearly, but I can buy it.\n\nWhat I don't get is why the three apprentice mages who are permanently turned into eels to power the magic fortress, which is an objectively horrible fate, don't struggle at all as they're essentially executed by Tissaia. There's no indication that any of them felt any sort of self-sacrificial loyalty for the Brotherhood, and even if they were lured there under false pretences, you'd figure the remaining two would start panicking after the first one got morphed.\n\nUnless I hear a better answer, I'm going to pretend that Tissaia told them a story about needing to pass some kind of test, and that story was a lie to prevent them from panicking.",

As a witcher I thought natural to support them. I rmemeber a dwarven blacksmith saying how the North rejected his kind and gave him a hard time. \n\nHaving watched the show and played thronebreaker it seems I was wrong, nilfgaard  take lands that are not there own leaving robbing, killing villagers in there wake. They used slave labour and force mages into confinment. I spent 400 hours in the witcher 3 and it shocks me that I missed all this lol. \n\nWas I wrong to support nilfgaard? Or is the Northern realms just a lesser evil? ;) perhaps its not so simple due to differences in timeline between the show and witcher 3. anyway if anything it gives me a reason to play the witcher 3 again!!

        "body": "I totally enjoyed the series and I'm looking forward to the next season. Cavill's portrayal of Geralt was phenomenal, as were most of the cast (ie. Calanthe, Jaskier/Dandelion, and more). However, I do have one caveat, and that was Yennefer's arc including the introduction of the mages. I felt that it was, probably, the weakest plot point in the season and one that wasn't fully developed.\n\nI know that S1 used non-linear storytelling to give a bit of background regarding the characters and the Witcher universe, but the mage arc, as a whole, felt more confusing that it had to be.\n\nYennefer is a hunchback. She's training to be a mage but keeps failing her lessons. All too suddenly, she became Tissaia's favorite. Obviously, this was given more nuance in the novels, but it was lacking in the show.\n\nThe same goes for all the politics involving the mages/Brotherhood. The political ramifications of having mages at courts, as well as the bickering between factions, wasn't fully realized until the end. ie. What was Yenn's planned posting at Nilfgaard supposed to accomplish? All we knew was that it was a \"backwater\" during the time when she was training, but it wasn't fully emphasized what role she would've played (and how things could've changed) if she was there as a \"steady hand.\"\n\nHaving read some of the novels and having played the games, I already knew what the story was. But, my wife (who's done neither), had a hard time following some of these plot points that I had to explain how things developed. I'm guessing there are some casual viewers who also ended up scratching their heads at some during the season.",

Sure there are lines of dialogue or characters appearing that indicate the period we are watching but with so many weird character names, confusing events and lookalike casting, its difficult to follow to say the least.\n\nThere was no clear indication whats now and whats then and the time jumps inherently bring disconnect with the characters.\n\nOverall i grew to like Henry Cavill as the Witcher, Jennifer is also great, the overal physical production level side of things is really high and the show presents a rich and enveloping world the viewer can enjoy.\n\nThe CGI on the other hand leave smt to be desired. In a post-GOT world, showing Dragons that look like they were made back in the Xena:Warrior Princess times doesnt cut it anymore, or morphing effects plucked str8 out of a \"Sliders\" .\n\nThat being said, the show has potential, but i feel  certain structure choices will alienate general audiences and keep this firmly lodged within the hardcore fanbase. In other words, i think it mustve been a bit more accessible and careful on how to present this new world to non-lore-familiar audiences.",

With that in mind, compared to Game of Thrones, The Witcher isn't holding up very well for me. I think it's getting a pass because of The Witcher brand. If this was a show with a different name, I'm not sure it'd be reviewed so kindly.\n\nFor a Netflix flagship series, everything looks a bit cheap. The sets *look* like sets. Nowhere looks lived in. It's hard to immerse yourself in the world when everywhere looks like a studio.\n\nThe story is confusing. I'm having trouble following what's going on. After three episodes, I was hoping it'd become clearer but I'm still left with a lot of questions.\n\nThe one positive is that Cavill is a great Geralt. I know nothing of the books/games but I feel like Cavill has brought Geralt to life enough that I'm happy to follow him.\n\nI will continue to watch all eight episodes in the hopes that everything becomes clear.",

With that, I can imagine how good Thanedd could be :)\n\nThanks for reading, it was just an appreciation post. I would be pleased to know what you think about this topic!",

        "body": "My biggest fear of season one was how they handle Yennefer, as she doesn't have the most share of the short stories, especially after learning that the show is basically split it into thirds, making the show one third of each family member, which is really awesome.\n\nAnd it turned out really great, I love it and I want it to keep it this way and focus on those three family members, but in the upcoming seasons there is even less material to adapt for Yennefer's story, her share of the overall plot is much smaller than by Geralt and Ciri. They also already handled her backstory, which we only learn about much much later in the novels.\n\nIn the novels it was like Geralt 40%, Ciri 40%, Yennefer 10% and 10% about the rest. If they want to show them evenly and I really hope they do all three justice, they either have to cut down Geralt's/Ciri's part or increase Yennefer's one.\n\nThere were also some events in season 1, which makes me doubt that certain things will actually happen in the show:\n\n1. In the show Yennefer never wanted to go back to Aretuza and she really doesn't like how the school (or precisely Tissaia) treats the pupils, why would she ever send Ciri to Aretuza then? I don't think she will in the show, at least not voluntary. \n\n2. Istredd has already refused her charm in the show and let her go (or he just went away, anyway), therefore Shard of Ice can't happening as it was in the books anymore. In the book he was still crazy about her to the point of dying for her, considering that Istredd in the show already rejected her, this is almost impossible to happen now.\n\n3. Yennefer gets turned into a statue later in the novels and is not around for quite a while, they can't do that in the show, not having Yennefer for a whole season or even more. For me personally Anya was one of the best parts of the whole show, even the best cast after all, it would be inexplicable to leave her out for a season or more.\n\n4. Geralt and Yennefer meet for the last time in Time of Contempt at the Thanedd Banquet, the next time will be in the last novel Lady of the Lake. Let's just assume that's 3 seasons, they can't possibly not show them together for 3 seasons after **that** introduction in season 1. Geralt already told her in ep6 that this isn't the wish, but it is real what they are feeling, which is such a small comment, but because it comes from Geralt it's huuuge. It took an eternity for him to admit his love for her and now he did it in a small comment already in the show. The show also underlines it, Borch: \"You're in love with her.\"\nThey also established them as such a power couple, it would be shame to not see them together for several seasons.\n\n5. Her expedition to Skellige was to find Ciri, however most of that adventure was for Yennefer to accept her cruel past and go on. We've already seen this. \n\n6. The Lodge of Sorceresses isn't doing *that* much in the books to be fair, most of the time they are just scheming plans and that's it. You can show that once or twice, but not for several seasons.\n\n\n\nPersonally I'd love to see Yennefer at Kaer Morhen and teach Ciri magic there, but I doubt they will do it in favor of Triss, but that would make them look as a whole family for once already and not only at the very end of the overall story.\n\n\nThere is also the possibility to add Yennefer to the hanza, which would create whole new interactions with the various characters and it would be an easy way to include her more into the overall story than just wasting time as a statue.\n\n\nSo what do you think will happen? Do you think they will team her up with Geralt and look for Ciri together, which I'd love to see, or give her more of her own and if so, what exactly?",

I see no reason why that shouldn't be the same case with the show. If your favorite thing about a character is their hair or skin color and not how they are written/played then you don't really love the character. \n\nTo quote a wise movie character, **\"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.\"**\n\nEDIT 2: To the folks saying \"it matters for Triss\" because some video game depicted her with *neon red hair* but hair color is not Jaskier's defining trait, why do you think Jaskier is named for a Buttercup/Dandelion *if not* his blonde hair? He is literally *named* for this trait. But nobody cares because it actually [insert shocked Pikachu face] doesn't matter.",

While I was always aware of the games, I never really had the chance to play them and vicariously experienced them by watching let's plays on Youtube. Though now thanks to the show I've purchased the Witcher 3 and I enjoy it quite a lot. I've also recently purchased the books as well. I particularly enjoy Nilfgaard in the books which looks like an actual menacing Empire especially with Emperor Emyhr voiced by Charles Dance.\n\nWhy is Nilfgaard starting off as a Kingdom in the show? How did they suddenly become an Empire? In the games they're portrayed as something akin to the Roman Empire which had its own Senate. Emhyr's father was a previous Imperial dynasty right? Don't the Nilfgaardians worship the sun or something? Why do they refer to their religion as the Cleansing White Flame? Also why do the Nilfgaardians have such terrible armor in the show when in the games, they are equipped with top of the line plate armor and weaponry? Why do the Nilfgaardians simply kill everyone and take no prisoners? In the games they have their own client kings and use intrigue and  negotiation like the actual Roman Empire did, to play off the other Northern Kingdoms against each other. While I liked the show, the way they portrayed Nilfgaard seemed quite off to me.",

        "title": "The Witcher: Clues and connecting themes. An analysis of 102 Four Marks",
        "body": "Spoilers for the first and second episode, light spoilers for the first season.\n\nFor many viewers it has proven to be difficult to follow the timelines in the show. The question has come up whether the show is too confusing or not. Others have criticized the narrative, which has been split into three character arcs, taking the focus away from the short stories. I want to identify the clues and themes and how they connect the storylines/timelines, hoping to provide some new grounds for deeper discussion with this ~~little~~ analysis. Welcome to part two!\n\n[Link to part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/eflu96/spoiler_the_witcher_clues_and_connecting_themes/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n**Timestamps**: Netflix shows the remaining time if you pause, so I'll keep that format, marked with the abbreviation \"re\" for \"remaining\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 102 FOUR MARKS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Clues\n\n&#x200B;\n\n38:30 re: \"They're elf ears. I killed them all. Doing my part to avenge human lives lost in **Filavandrel**'s uprising. \\[...\\] The elves call him \"king\". Last year, he tried to **claim Cintran land**\" (Adon Ozol to Ciri)\n\n18:07 re: \"Then go **somewhere else**. Rebuild. Get strong again. Show the humans that you are more than what they fear you to be\"  (Geralt to **Filavandrel**)\n\n17:24 re: \"Let us **take back** what's ours. Starting now\" (Toruviel to Filavandrel)\n\nThis is a very subtle hint that Geralt's storyline is in the past in relation to Ciri's storyline, because Filavandrel seems to have taken Geralt's advice to a certain point, but fell back to violent ways, probably due to elves like Toruviel influencing him on that matter. This also connects the arcs by having Geralt's advice snowball into Filavandrel's uprising and the situation in Cintra. But more on that later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n19:09 re: \"My **elders** worked with humans and got robbed of all they had. And when they fought back, they were slaughtered. '**The Great Cleansing**', humans call it. \\[...\\] They'll make slaves of us. Pariahs of **half-blood** children\" (Filavandrel to Geralt)\n\n12:30 re: \"My **father**... My real father... He was **half-elf**. Do you remember the **Great Cleansing**? \\[...\\] That's how my father died\" (Yennefer to Istredd)\n\nWhile Yennefer refers to her father, Filavandrel refers to his elders. His wording makes it clear that The Great Cleansing was long ago for him, while it happened in Yennefer's recent memory, who is still very young, which means that Yennefer's story takes place before Geralt's at this point. But to recognize this, one must know that elves have longer lifes than humans, which has not been established yet in the show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Connecting themes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis episode juggles all three storylines and devotes most of its time to the introduction of Yennefer, while Geralt and Ciri take a backseat. But how does it connect those storylines? The answer is, by a whole lot of themes, I was suprised at how much I found. So let's go through them one by one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The elves: chaos and identity**\n\nOnce again, the clues and the themes are connected. Elves play a role in all three storylines, most prominently in Geralt's short story arc, where he \"meets\" the elven king Filavandrel at the edge of the world. Istredd tells a distraught Yennefer about the elves who built Aretuza and taught the humans how to turn **chaos** into magic, \"and then... the humans **slaughtered** them\" (14:23 re). Filavandrel mentions this, too, referring to the **Great Cleansing**. This racial conflict is also portrayed in Ciri's storyline, with Adon Ozol telling her about the elves he killed and the mistreated dwarf Abbott taking merciless and brutal revenge on Adon's mother, Lilja Ozol. \"You're an elf\" (05:04 re), Ciri deduces at the end of the episode, in the moment Dara drops his guard, or in this case, his hat, having disappeared earlier when Ciri entered the refugee camp. Ciri continues with a simple \"thank you\" and they both introduce themselves properly to each other by name. She seems to recognize that they are not so different.\n\nIt is in this episode that we hear Elder Speech, the language of the elves, for the first time. Yennefer's elven heritage is a possible explanation for her powers, since she reveals the truth about her half-elven father right after summoning a portal, much to Istredd's astonishment. According to her, it's also the reason for her disfigurement and why she's only worth four marks, or how her charming stepfather Fletcher puts it, \"no daughter of mine\" (55:55 re). The fact that her father is half-elf has formed her **identity** to this point, and it's going to have unforseen consequences. This question of identity is also briefly discussed in Geralt's storyline. First he corrects Toruviel who calls him and Jaskier \"humans\" -- \"**one** human\" (20:27 re), he tells her, \"and you can let him go\". Geralt subtly identifies with the elves, which contributes to Filavandrel letting them both go. Torque, the Sylvan who Geralt spared earlier, defends him against Filavandrel, arguing that \"he's different. Like **us**\" (17:04 re). The other connection to Yennefer's storyline is his brief discussion of **chaos** with Filavandrel, who says that \"even chaos is polluted\" (19:32 re).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Survival and control**\n\nAll three main characters find themselves in life-threatening situations. This may not seem like an unique situation to someone like Geralt, but he finds himself in a position where he lost **control**. He cannot defend himself with a sword or magic like in the first episode, having to rely on his persuasive wits instead to **survive**.\n\nYennefer on the other hand attempts suicide by cutting herself. She claims that at least she had **control** over her **death**, but Tissaia disagrees, saying that \"you weren't taking **control**, you were losing it\" (44:53 re). During the first lesson in the greenhouse, Tissaia tells Anica that she should \"listen closely\" because her \"**survival** depends on it\" (43:18 re), seemingly referring to the dangers of **chaos**. Yet all the grave accidents that occur during the lessons do not prove to be deadly to anyone. The true meaning of survival in Aretuza is only revealed when Yennefer witnesses the very opposite to ascension. Tissaia turns her friend Anica and two other girls into eels, to serve as conduits to Aretuza, a fate that is potentially even worse than death. What do eels do, anyway?\n\nCiri's first encounter with **survival** tactics are the poison berries Dara shows her not to eat. Later she finds herself in an extremely dangerous situation when the Nilfgaardian soldiers attack. While Cahir, who appears briefly, does not mean to kill her, it is not hard to see that any bloodthirsty soldier or a stray arrow could have been her end. She owes her survival to her newfound friend, Dara.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Allies, mentors and mother figures**\n\nDara proves to be a key to Ciri's survival, sharing non-poisonous food with her and saving her from the Nilfgaardian attack, proving himself to be a real **ally**. The Ozol family is also very welcoming to Ciri, quickly taking her in. Lilja Ozol presents a possible **mother figure**, but her abuse of the dwarf Abbott proves to be her undoing. As the story goes on, Ciri becomes more withdrawn from other people as the season goes on, rejecting (potential) mother figures like Eithne and Zola (Yurga's wife in the final episode), since she is looking for something... more.\n\nYennefer is struggling with her family's rejection, but she soon finds a rough and authoritarian **mentor** in Tissia de Vries. Istredd also presents himself as an ally and a **romantic interest** with whom she can share her deeper feelings. He helps her overcome her insecurities. but this comes at the price of a mutual **betrayal**. After they have a particularly emotional scene where she reveals the truth about her parentage to him, it is later revealed that Yen controlled her emotions to manipulate Istredd into giving her the Feainnewedd flower, proving herself to Tissaia. Istredd on the other hand gives her secret away to Stregobor. Yennefer also has a brief **friendship** with Anica. They tell each other that \"you can do it\" (32:42 re, 24:58 re), but in the end, only one of them can, while the other one pushes her friend into the pool - another **betrayal**, albeit one out of obedience, with the prospect of ascension.\n\nJaskier is an **ally** who Geralt didn't ask for, rewarding his new companion with a gut punch for an unknowingly insensitive comment (The Butcher of Blaviken -- too soon, man, too soon). \"I'd say you have a bit of an image problem\" (36:09 re ) is Jaskier's response to that, who refuses to leave Geralt's side, hoping to get good material for his next ballad. Of course Geralt isn't too eager about that and they part ways at the end of the episode. The connecting theme here is that all three main characters seem to find friends and allies without actually asking for them, they just seem to fly at them. But the relationships prove to be **complicated**, some even ending in betrayal or death, while others are rather one-sided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Innocence and naiveté**\n\n\"Sometimes a **flower** is just a flower... And the best thing it can do for us is to die\" (40:49 re, similarly 06:33 re)\n\nTissaia de Vries tells Yennefer this, at first to explain the balance of chaos, but later to justify the sacrifice of the girls who were only worthy to exist as conduits for Aretuza. The very first shot of Yennefer is her holding a **daisy flower**, offering to give it back to the peasant girl with a smile, and the last shot of the episode is her sharing a less innocuous smile with Tissaia. Yennefer manipulating Istredd into giving her the **Feainnewedd** marks the loss of her **innocence**, even though the emotions they share still seem to be genuine. Later she pushes her eel-turned friend obediently into the pool, which marks another **loss of innocence**. Yennefer turned from a **naive girl** into a somewhat **manipulative sorceress** who slowly defeats her insecurities, but that comes at a price, as later episodes will reveal. All these character changes are influenced by Tissaia.\n\nCiri experiences the horrors of war up close, having a woman stabbed to death before her eyes and discovering a murdered Adon. She also learns that many Cintrans despise Calanthe (\"That wretched bitch and her wretched family\", 37:33 re). She starts the episode with putting mud in her hair to be less noticeable and picks up other survival skills with the help of Dara. By the end of the episode, she has not only seen a lot, but also starts to lose the **naivité** that came with her sheltered upbringing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Home and family**\n\n\"Do you know anyone that would choose to leave their **home**?\" (20:44 re, Filavandrel to Jaskier)\n\nThe loss of home is a theme from episode one that continues in this episode, binding the different storylines together. First we have the elves of Dol Blathanna who were forced out of their home. Even Cintra was \"the elves' land first\" (37:24 re), as Zeke Ozol points out. The Cintrean refugees had to flee from their home due to the Nilfgaardian invasion, something they share with Ciri. Yennefer is taken away from her home and sold for four marks to Tissaia, who later tells a homesick Anica that \"this is your home\" (43:20 re). Yennefer wants to go back at first, but her protests are fruitless. And the only home Geralt seems to know is the road. Almost all of the characters are forced to lead a nomadic life, and the students of Aretuza are not all there by choice. Additionally, by this episode it's clear that both Ciri and Yennefer have lost their **families** and are looking for a new one. Ciri bonds over her loss with Lilja Ozol in a touching scene, but the reality of war forces her to continue her search for a family elsewhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Destiny and the Nilfgaardian connection**\n\n\"I'm looking for Geralt of Rivia\"\n\n\"He's a knight?\"\n\n\"I don't know\" (28:29 re, Ciri and Lilja Ozol)\n\nThe last words of Calanthe are the only guide left for Ciri, and she doesn't even know who Geralt of Rivia is, nor does she know that he already changed her **destiny**. He does this unknowingly by advising Filavandrel to find a new home and rebuild. Years later, Filavandrel's uprising in Cintra is the result of that, and according to Adon, \"**Nilfgaard** only got past Cintran borders because of Elven spies\" (37:26 re). By saving his own life, Geralt has set a series of events in motion that push Ciri on a path towards him. It seems that destiny is indeed inescapable.\n\n[Link to part three](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/ehmxlc/the_witcher_clues_and_connecting_themes_an/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[Link to part four](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/ek5hs5/the_witcher_clues_and_connecting_themes_an/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[Link to part five](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/f0kgol/the_witcher_the_themes_connecting_the_main/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",

This would allow the show to focus on Geralt and Yennefer plots which could be linear and have more space to breathe, especially their romance. \n\nHopefully this would also let them rellocate more resources for the occasionally awful CGI that makes the show laughable at points.

        "title": "A review of Season 1 of The Witcher by a long time sub",
        "body": "Overall, for all the fanfare, The Witcher has been a personal disappointment from the vast hype generated in the buildup to release. There was much to love in the show: the goofy humour (particularly between  Jaskier and Geralt), Cavill as Geralt, Chaotra as Yennefer, Queen Calanthe in “Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials\", the soundtrack and most of the action sequences and choreography.\n\nHowever, the show has many flaws the undermine the great moments and prevent the show from reaching the heights it could have reached.\n\nFirstly, *the narrative felt rushed*. I feel that Lauren S. Hissrich made a poor decision in the inclusion of  Ciri from the first episode. I understand that she wanted to make the women in Geralt's life have a greater role but the execution was so  poor. The narrative and timeline was near incomprehensible for my girlfriend who is new to The Witcher.\n\nI strongly believe that an anthology season from the perspective of Geralt would have worked that much better as key  stories such as The Lesser Evil, The Edge of the World and The Witcher could have done with more space to develop him as a character.\n\nSecondly, *the writing and creative choices are inconsistent in quality and often very poor.*\n\nAs a lover of the short stories, I thought certain changes detracted from the original works:\n\n* The Lesser Evil was used to set up the grand narrative rather than actually develop Renfri or Stregobor through flashbacks. I thought cutting the Tridam Ultimatum was a huge mistake.\n* The Witcher had all of the political intrigue between Velerad, Ostrit and Foltest erased while giving the king a far more detached, villainous aura. The inclusion of Triss was fine in theory but again executed poorly as it evolved into a mystery at the expense of political intrigue.\n* The Last Wish changed Geralt and Yennefer's first meeting for no reason whatsoever. The charm of Geralt bringing apple juice to a hungover Yennefer is replaced with a meaningless orgy. Also, having Yen not hear Geralt's last wish is so stupid as it reinforces her connection to him.\n* The Bounds of Reasons was a cheap, poor re-telling. It removed all of the best parts: Eyck's horseback duel, Yennefer turning carts of villagers into frogs with her feet (likely for lack of budget given how Villentretenmerth looked) and they made Yarpen act like a fisstech fiend for no reason.\n* Finally, the last great travesty was not including The Sword of Destiny with a younger Ciri. It utterly undermines Something More and makes Geralt and Ciri's first meeting ridiculous as they have never met. Then the stinger of cutting the Something More dialogue and replacing it with “Who's Yennefer?” We get it, Lauren…\n\nMuch of Yennefer's origin storyline was pretty dull and boring. The plot elements such as the eels and Yennefer defying the Brotherhood and ascending felt very questionable and very High School drama. The poor set design made Aretuza duller than it needed to be. Istredd is a saving  grace for many of these original parts of Yennefer's storyline and Royce Pierreson owns it.\n\nCiri's whole arc this season failed to develop her character any further than what was achieved in her introduction in the short stories. Dara and The Adonis had no impact on the story other than padding.\n\nIn conclusion, The Witcher is an enjoyable if flawed show that pays homage to the books but doesn't quite deliver the greatness anticipated from watching the trailers.\n\nI look forward to Season 2 with tempered expectations.\n\ntl;dr - 6/10, The Witcher is an enjoyable if flawed show that pays homage  to the books but doesn't quite deliver the greatness anticipated from  watching the trailers.",

        "body": " **Before you read!**\n\n**Spoilers for the whole show, as well as the first book.**\n\n**And sorry for the great wall of China sized post.**\n\n\\- I've played the 2nd and 3rd game of the witcher and I'm thinking about starting on the 1st one as soon as possible. Yes, I know that they're not adapting the games. I just finished the first book, \"The Last Wish\" so a lot of what's been adapted in this season is from this book, and I just got to say that I am quite disappointed in this show and neither my girlfriend nor I understand why people like it as much as they do.\n\n\\- I really don't want to dislike this show, the reason I picked up the books was because of its announcement. Sure I thought about picking them up just after finishing the 3rd game, but I kind of forgot to. But when the show was for real I got my shit together and picked up the first book which, as I mentioned, I just finished, I got the rest as a present and I am really looking forward to reading them. Please understand that I am not trying to say that the show that you all love is shit, or that you all have bad taste. I just want to share with you my problems with the show and I would appreciate it if you could tell me exactly why you like it so much.\n\n**Writing problems**\n\nMy biggest problem with the series so far is Jaskier/ Dandelion...\n\n\\- I 'm really, really, really sad to see what's become of him. At first, I didn't understand that it was Dandelion, I thought \"surely this annoying bard can't be him. I mean he is introduced in the same short story that Dandelion is, but man I'm sure this can't be the Dandelion from the books that very much resembles the one from the games...\". Oh... my god what have they done to you, my dear Dandelion? You're supposed to be a ladies man, you're supposed to come with dirty jokes, witty comments or do something stupid but hilarious while pissing Geralt off but making him laugh even though he is mad at you. You're not supposed to be this prepubescent man who claims he is wooing ladies while having nothing to show for it, nor are you supposed to come with just dumb comments or just fuck up Geralt's work and make him furious at you. Ohh my dear Dandelion, may you strive to be what you once was. I miss his pink/ purple tunic alongside his hat. Also, I feel like when Geralt insulted his singing it would've been more in character to just laugh it off and say something like \"I know you love my singing\".\n\n\\- In episode 5: the doppler claiming he knows everything about Mousesack, and then he can't answer Ciri's question. I quote from the episode \"Everything you've ever done, ever debated, ever dreamt is in our head now\". In episode 6: he then claims to know all of the winged soldier's tricks after transforming into him.\n\n\\- In episode 2: it was very odd when Yennefer decided to obey Tissaia after seeing her friend being turned into an eel. \"Come push your friend into the water\", \"No\", \"Yes\" \\*Pushes her friend into the water, and smiles\\* \\*Tissaia smiles back\\*.\n\n\\- In episode 4: Jaskier claims that he has made Geralt famous, but it really doesn't feel like it. Sure he has written a ballad, but it doesn't seem like anyone really knows him except for main figures, and that one crowd that sang the song. The line was just written in too early. It doesn't feel like the people of this world hate witchers as much as they are supposed to do. Yes, he got stoned in the first episode but that's only because he fricking slaughtered 6-7 people in the streets. The only place where he was not wanted was in the pub in episode 1.\n\n\\- Triss being criminally underused\n\n\\- In episode 5: changing it so that Geralt is fishing for the Djinn instead of actually fishing for fish and just finding the Djinn by coincidence. Why and how did he know that the Djinn was sealed away in the jar in this little pond? And why rewrite it so that Jaskier is just standing there annoying him instead of being a lad and helping him fish for fish? It would've made Jaskier a bit better character for me.\n\n\\- In episode 6: Ciri telling Dara to kill the Doppler, it didn't really feel like Ciri would suggest something like that.\n\n**Pacing** **issues**\n\n\\- Yennefer's character development went a little bit too fast from \"Just trying to find a place in this world\" to \"Mega-bitch\"\n\n\\- Episode 5 - 6: Geralt falling in love with Yennefer after having met her once in the show and then they're talking like they've met each other many times. But it is kind of hard to believe as the timeline and year is something being kept top-secret as it is government information.\n\n\\- In episode 4: I had to explain Pavetta's wedding to my girlfriend after the episode was done. Everything just happened too fast for her to understand the rules regarding the law of surprise. I'm sure I wouldn't've understood it myself if I hadn't read the story.\n\n\\- They should've slapped on a text that displayed year the first time they jumped in-between timelines.\n\n**Not enough info**\n\n\\- In episode 6 when Yennefer calls out to Geralt telling him to use Aard. What effect did the kiss have? As it stands it may have amplified the power of the sign, but heck if I know. To me, it just seemed like an odd cliché moment.\n\n\\- In episode 6: Villentretenmerth who can turn into a dragon/ human, why can he/ it do that?\n\n**Important things that were skipped**\n\n\\- In episode 5: info about the Djinn, I feel that if we got to know more about this monster it would've sparked more interest in the world's monsters. There is a lot more info about the Djinn and its counterparts in the book, which made me want to read the bestiary. And I am one who usually skips on reading everything of collectibles and lore in games. Also, it wrecked the whole town, not just the one house that they were in, it kind of underplays the Djinn's powers, which in turn makes Yennefer seem like less of a bigshot.\n\n\\- In episode 2: a lot more happened in the village when Geralt accepted to help the townspeople and their problem with the Sylvan. While Geralt and Jaskier were held captive by the elves it just didn't stick right with me why the elves should've trusted him and decided to release them. In the book, we learn that the elves are trying to adapt to the human's lifestyle by learning about agriculture and how to take care of farmland properly. The only reason why Geralt and Dandelion are spared is because of a goddess-like figure referred to as a prophetess appearing telling the elves to let them go. The prophetesses are some strange specter like creature from what I can tell that has exceptional judgment power who is said to always be right about whatever they decide upon, which is why the elves let them go. Another thing which is sad to see written out is when Geralt talks about his code. Which forbids him from killing intelligent creatures, this helps build up Geralt's character. It tells us that he doesn't always kill monsters just because they're monsters. In episode 2 he says he won't kill the Sylvan because he is intelligent, but doesn't explain why he can't/ won't kill intelligent creatures.\n\n\\- A story in the first book, Geralt meets a monster that can talk, he discovers that the monster doesn't really harm anyone and that he has fallen in love with a woman. Geralt leaves the monster be and is on his way. Really missed opportunity to humanize some of the monsters or those who've been cursed to become monsters. Showing us that it's not just black and white about monsters wanting to kill humans. (Crossing my fingers they maybe adapt this in another season).\n\n**Makes no sense** **(IMO)**\n\n\\- In episode 8: two mages give up their lives to create one measly fireball, Yennefer absorbs fire and unleashes it. Fringilla could've made a bonfire, absorbed it and put it in the trebuchet.\n\n\\- In episode 8: Geralt's fight with the ghouls, after putting the sword in the ground to kill a ghoul another one jumps him from the side. With his witcher senses, this shouldn't be possible as he would hear it coming from a long distance.\n\n\\- In episode 7: Vilgefortz who got shit on by Stregebor because he had learned how to use a sword, meanwhile Yennefer knows how to dual wield and Sabrina is a professional archer, hitting glass bottles mid-air. I wouldn't have thought that they would know how to use these weapons as it seemed as mages who use weapons get frowned upon.\n\n\\- In episode 5: Mousesack is being told to run, just to get gently pushed down by the doppler about 10 meters away from where he ran from. Why?\n\n\\- Episode 8: Ciri runs away from the house, let us say that she is running north into the forest. Geralt also enters the forest but in a bit more north-west direction, and for some reason Ciri decides to come back south, to meet up with Geralt purely by chance. And why does she know what Geralt looks like? She's never seen him before and Geralt's seen her face for like 1 second. Which then in turn kind of makes it weird that they suddenly hug each other.\n\n**Nitpicky things**\n\n\\- In episode 8: the ghoul CGI looks kind of bad\n\n\\- In episode 1: Renfri's adaptational attractiveness: in the book, she is described to be having a bad haircut, it is cut uneven. Her clothes are messy and it seemed like she was kind of a big woman (as tall as Geralt), not a supermodel.\n\n\\- I really dislike that they call him Jaskier instead of Dandelion.\n\n\\- Henry's acting kind of falls short sometimes, showing too much teeth sometimes while speaking, it looks kind of weird to me, and it's just so weird hearing Geralt swear that much. Also, never ever did he once say \"Damn you're ugly\" nor did he say \"Looks like rain\". That by far has to be his worst sin in life.\n\n\\- In episode 7: the part where Yennefer got three students high was kind of unnecessary and just felt like filler material.\n\n\\- In episode 3 27:50 - 28:04: this one doesn't affect the story in any way, but it's a matter of consistency: when Yennefer finds out she is not to be placed in Aedirn's court she speaks with Tissaia \\*dialogue\\*. Tissaia stands up **behind** her desk \\*more dialogue\\* Yennefer walks out. Tissaia? **In the middle of the room!**\n\n\\- Episode 4 - 23:30. The man who controls the creature looks like he is green-screened/ photoshopped into the shot.\n\n\\- In episode 6: when Yennefer walking up the mountain in her winter cloak, while Téa and Véa are wearing t-shirts.\n\n**Costumes**\n\n\\- Erect penis amour for the Nilfgaardian soldiers.\n\n\\- In episode 4: a bit disappointed by the Striga visually, arms looking a bit wonky when it jumps on Geralt the first time, and the eyes are a bit weird as well. It was a bit too \"muddy\" to really get a good look at it.\n\n**Things that I liked**\n\n\\- Other than what I mentioned above about Henry's acting I really like him as Geralt. He is almost spot on appearance-wise and how he behaves.\n\n\\- The fight scenes are very well choreographed, except for the ghoul fight. It was just kind of messy\n\n\\- The soundtrack is amazing, the only thing I miss is the combat music from the 3rd game. But I guess that CD project red probably has the rights to that music. Though \"The song of the white wolf\" and \"Toss a coin to your witcher\" makes up for it.\n\n\\- Yennefer's acting especially in the second episode where she looks in the mirror and thinks about the four marks she was sold for. Man, this scene really is twisting my heart. Just everything about her acting before her transformation is so damn good. Not saying that after the transformation it is bad, it's just that before the transformation my heart bleeds for her. After the transformation is the Yennefer I know and am not too fond of as it reminds me of someone in my real life. Though her acting is spot on here as well.\n\n\\- I hated Calanthe in the book, and well the actress does a damn good job at making me hate Calanthe (not the actor)\n\n\\- The CGI on the Hirikka in episode 6 was pretty good.\n\nYes, I am really digging deep here poking at every little detail, but that is only because I love this universe so much and I don't want it's potential to be wasted. I hope that this is only a rocky start for the series and that it will pick itself up as it goes on but for now my overall score for this show has to be 3.5/10.",

        "title": "What means Jaskier? - answer for queston you never asked.",
        "body": "Hi, guys! I've seen many post about \"Why **Jaskier** not **Dandelion** ?\" BUT YOU DON'T GET FEW THINGS!\n\nHis name is a polish word-game untranslatable into English.\n\nTrully I think that is just decision of whole Netflix's crew & screenwriters. Amazing performance of Jaskier from the show is another interpretation of that character from the book - he is not acctually a womanaizer. You know, not so \"dandy\" anymore in the Netflix version ;) **but cute AF!**\n\nEven Joey Batley himself said \"Stereotypical character womanaizer I think is a little played down\"\n\nSo maybe that was the secund reason why his name is stayed Jaskier? (The first one is OFC -  usually you don’t translate character names between languages. )\n\nWhole internet know that in polish the word \"jaskier\" means \"buttercup\".\n\nBut I have NO IDEA WHY POLISH FANBASE didn't translate to users of other languages the obvious associations that this specific word evokes in us (yeah, I'm polish too).\n\nOkay guys, so - according to dictionary **Jaskier** is translates as a name of the flower, the one called in english \"buttercup\", BUT for polish spreakers pronunciation of that word and first thought that came to your mind have association with such a word as **JASKRAWY**  \\[i ̯askr**a**vy\\]  which means (according to google translator) bright\\*, vivid, brilliant, garish, flashy, flaring, gaudy. :) And speaking of the color in the adjective: very intense, dazzling color.\n\nAnd because of word \"JASKRAWY\" - my dearest foreign fans :) - polish botanist created a name for the flower know to you as \"buttercup\" ( a small plant with bright yellow petals that flashes like a light bulb in the meadow) with using the most obvious word they had to describe that flower. :) So DIRECT translation to  english from polish will be something like \"the flashy one\" ;) no fluffy \"buttercup\" but very sharp musculine word with meaning \"**The flashy one**\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here comes Sapkowski - he named his character by playing with words and subconscious of the readers. So if you reading the book you get poetical nickname driven from flower\"Jaskier\". Firstly it shows how modest and humble our bard is (because, buttercup is still a tiny flower among a million other identical on the meadow - oh, modesty in Poland is a feature that is overly appreciated). But on the other hand also you already know that he is flashy, and bright, likes to play with words and metaphors, and he is simply born to be the STAR! :D\n\nWe can also use the expression \"jaskrawa osobowość / bright personality\" (it doesn't necesarilly mean to be cheerful person) - it means that someone is an individualist, likes to stand in the spotlight. He/She can also represent an extreme approach to life, be controversial. In other word - it's hard not to notice such a person. :D\n\nBTW- in polish **glaucoma**  \\[eye disease, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide after cataracts\\] is called **JASKRA**. ;) Do you feel now how strong connection this word evokes in polish-speakers? If something is \"jaskrawy\" it usually makes your eyes hurt, something that dazzles you.\n\nAnd one note for book readers: the same ethymology driven from common old polish word have another character from the book: Iskra, a member of The Rats  (tell me pease if \"Jaskier\" and \"iskra\" souds similar to you, becouse for me resemblance is SO obvious, bu it may be couse I'm polish tho). Word \"iskra\" means \"spark/glint\". Once, in XV in Poland word \"jaskra\" meant the same thing as \"iskra\" nowadays (I read it on the internet, I'm not a language specialist. If you have any additional information let me know!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo... you see, bards name is part of his PR :P\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCDPR use \"Dandilion\" trying to catch this ambiguity of \"Jaskier\" - and you have an association with a \"dandy\" and a \"flower\" from a meadow, but this is probably not what Andrzej Sapkowski meant. But it works for games! :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*But you see \"Jaskrawy\" can be translated as \"bright\", but in polish exist another word for just \"bright\" - \"jasny\". So \"jaskrawy\" is not even meaning for something very bright, but for something  overwhelmingly flashy that hurts your eyes np:  your neon-yellow spotrs shoes are \"jaskrawe buty\". :P Do you now get it?",

        "body": "So, while I actually thought that the show was pretty good, my main gripe with it was how Nilfgaard was represented and wanted to know your opinion. Let’s put the armor aside for a moment (I think we can all agree it’s awful) and focus on other things.\n\n1. Nilfgaard was some petty kingdom with an army composed of rabble before Emhyr took over and conquered Cintra.\nThis one doesn’t make any sense to me. Nilfgaard was already a huge empire before conquering Cintra and it’s hard to believe that it conquered all that land with a rabble that doesn’t use formations, shields, spears, cavalry or even ranged weapons (other than to break through magical barriers with flaming arrows). I guess they did it to make Emhyr’s role in the plot more important but it still bothers me a lot. Hilariously enough the Polish subtitles still refer to Nilfgaard as an empire, even when the actors clearly say “kingdom”.\n\n2. Nilfgaardians are religious fanatics and Emhyr is some God Emperor figure with the cult of the White Flame built around him. \nI guess we can’t say for certain if that’s the case, but it definitely looks that way. With all the “the White Flame burns inside you” crap and the soldier preaching gibberish to Geralt before dying, it looks like the series took the Eternal Fire religion and made it Nilfgaard’s state religion with Emhyr being worshipped as some divine figure at its centre. I really don’t like this approach and preferred the Roman-like interpretation of Nilfgaard, where it was a ruthless empire fuelled by expansion and slavery but also the force of progress with a sophisticated civilisation. It made things more grey and interesting, here Nilfgaard is just your typical cliche Evil Empire with religious fanaticism.\n\nDid you like the way Nilfgaard was represented in the series? Am I overreacting and the second season will prove me wrong? Let me know what you guys think.",

I've tried online Wiki's which have helped with most. But the main one I have is about Ciri and Geralt's relationship so please bear with me.\n\n\\*SPOILERS\\*\n\nSo throughout the story your are showed how Ciri is destined to meet/ know Garalt. But the part that confuses me the most is the concept of the Law of Surprise. After saving Ciri's father Duny, Geralt is offered the Law of Surprise not believing in it Geralt blatantly accepts but after doing so mentions Pavetta is unknowingly preggers with Ciri. My question is, did Geralt use his Law of Surprise to request to protect Ciri for the imminent attack. Or was there something different  in the fact that he sensed that Pavetta was pregnant giving him a unique title toward Ciri?, having consulted the Wiki's it has made is more confusing any help would be great.\n\nThanks in advance",

        "body": "At the start of Yen's arc she is taught to control her chaos. She is shown to disregard this at first and struggle in her development as a mage. Later on she accepts this advice and becomes a fully fledged sorceress. Then in her last scene, she is told to embrace her chaos instead in order to unleash a massive amount of power and basically win the battle. \n\nAlright, but then, how in the world can she unleash her chaos and at the same time control it in order not to burn Tissaia to a crisp? I thought the whole point of Tissaia laying wounded on the battle field and her telling Yennefer to unleash her chaos was to point out that despite what was shown to us, she still had a good intentions. Wasn't it extremely clear that she meant to sacrifice herself so that Yen could hurry up and sweep the enemy in 1 hit? \n\nHow can you unleash your chaos in the most grand way we have seen and maybe is possible, but at the same time still control it? The scale of that last move was huge. So far we have only seen magic in small and controlled ways, yet this spell, or whatever you call it, was immensely powerful. Shouldn't you completely lose control? Isn't that the whole idea behind ''Forget the bottle, let the chaos explode'', losing control and letting your emotions run wild to fuel it?\n\nI just thought that 1 small detail kind of contradicted everything that was thaught to us about the magic in this series and took away from the impact of that scene on Yennefer. Something that makes a story interesting isn't necessarily a massive battle, but rather the people we know who fight in them. If Yen had killed her old teacher, mentor and friend, that scene would have had a way bigger impact. Instead, Yen just kinda shouted, cried and won the battle. And it's a powerful moment, don't get me wrong, but what it missed was a bit of personal sacrifice/loss. Which is something that always spices up a scene. And Tissaia was perfectly placed to supply that. I just think that they either had to have Tissaia move from the battlefield or, better yet, let her die in Yen's fire to create a more impactful scene. What do you think?",

Stregobor was acting as if Geralt had done something wrong. Was it just that Geralt was seduced by Renfri or was there somthing else to it?\n\n2. the relationship between Yennefer and Tissaia, is it akin to master and slave (given that Tissaia bought her) or mentor and reluctant mentee?\n\n3. Where exactly was the place where Yenneger kept portalling to to spend time with Istredd?\n\n4. When Yenneger portalled the first time, Istredd seemed to be saying that someone can follow her through the portal and cause trouble. Was he referring to Tissaia? Why would Tissaia cause trouble?\n\n5. if I am understanding the timeline correctly, the events that we have seen take place to yennefer happen before the events that happen to Geralt which happen before the events that happen to Cirilla?\n\n6. Did Tissaia basically kill the 3 students who she turned into eels?\n\n7. do The Brotherhood of Sorcerer basically keep an eye on all the kingdoms and ensure they are all taken care of?\n\n8. Why does the fact that Yennefer have elvin blood mean that she has to go to Nilfgaard instead of Aedirn? I think they said it was because they couldn't risk someone with elvin blood being near Aedirn but didn't really understand the reason why?\n\n9. Do all the people who undergo the transformation to be beautiful have to give up their fertility or was yennefer special in that case?\n\n10. What exactly is that Law of Surprise and why was Queen Calanthe so opposed to it?\n\n11. What exactly causes Urcheon to suffer from a curse that transforms him into a hedgehog and when was this curse placed on him?\n\n12. How is a sorcerer different from an elf?\n\n13. Is Geralt supposed to be a good person? as in, is his killing of monsters driven more by a desire to protect the innocent or kill monters?\n\n14. why did Geralt come to the aid of Urcheon?\n\n15. Geralt or someone implied that Queen Calanthe knew that Urcheon would be showing up and she had planned to try and have Geralt kill him? Did I misunderstand that bit? How did she know?\n\nSorry for all the questions, the first 4 episodes just do a mass information overload.",

        "title": "The Witcher: Clues and connecting themes. An analysis of 103 \"Betrayer Moon\"",
        "body": "Spoilers for this episode and light spoilers for the first season.\n\nSince the launch of Season 1, it has become evident that a lot of people had problems with following the different timelines and the question has come up whether the show is too confusing or not. Others have criticized the narrative, which has been split into three character arcs, taking the focus away from the short stories. I want to identify the clues and themes and how they connect the storylines/timelines, hoping to provide some new grounds for deeper discussion with this analysis. Especially the themes are important to the overall narrative of the episode, since they connect the seemingly unrelated storylines on a deeper level. Welcome to part three!\n\n[Link to part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/eflu96/spoiler_the_witcher_clues_and_connecting_themes/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[Link to part two](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/eg4aep/the_witcher_clues_and_connecting_themes_an/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n**Timestamps**: Netflix shows the remaining time if you pause, so I'll keep that format, marked with the abbreviation \"re\" for \"remaining\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 103 BETRAYER MOON\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Clues\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarting with something simple, if you follow [this link to imgur](http://imgur.com/a/V3S5XjX), you'll see **Stregobor** from two different episodes: 101 \"The End's beginning\" and now this episode. He certainly looks  **younger** in 103, where he has brown and well groomed **hair**, whereas in 101 his hair is unkept, white and grey, a reflection of his **age**. This is a visual clue indicating that Yennefer's storyline takes place years before Geralt's.\n\nAnother obvious clue is the fact that **Foltest** appears in both storylines; Geralt meets him when he is already an **old king** while Tissaia briefly meets him as a **young prince** in Yennefer's storyline, as well as his sister Adda and his mother, Queen Sancia (\"Foltest, leave your sister be\", 27:46 re). There's also an **old painting** of him and Adda on the walls of the old castle (37:10 re), which is shown before that scene, [here's the comparison](http://imgur.com/a/Ri67j9U). The **name \"Foltest\"** is first mentioned by Tsoka who tells Lord Ostrit that \"Foltest commits treason\" (58:08 re), his name is then repeated a lot of times throughout the episode. This is a noticeable clue that many viewers should be able to catch. It also builds on the Stregobor-clue by specifying the time gap between the two timelines; it's clear that there are at least a **couple of decades** between the storylines of Yennefer and Geralt at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n59:44 re \"My son \\[...\\] told me in Nilfgaard the **king** **diddled whores** while his **subjects starved**. Then someone came. The Usurper. And he rallied **the people**. And they **took back** what was theirs!\" (Tsoka to the miners)\n\n55:14 re: \"After **Nilfgaard** **overthrew** their **king**, the **Brotherhood** couldn't risk it happening again, so they sent me here\" (Triss to Geralt)\n\n42:45 re: Artorius: \"How fares **Nilfgaard**?\"\n\nVanielle of Brugge: \"**King** Fergus is proving to be an effective and excitable young king\"\n\nStregobor: \"**Horny**, she means. Spending the kingdom's money on **women** as his **people starve** to death\"\n\nTissaia: \"Fringilla will be in **Nilfgaard** by week's end. She will bring sanity and bread to **the people**\"\n\nThese clues occur in a relatively short time span in the episode, first we have the \"almost-revolt\" by the miners, mentioning the King of Nilfgaard. Triss mentions him again, making it clear that he was overthrown. In the revolt and the meeting of sorcerers it's mentioned that the young king lets his **people** starve while entertaining himself with prostitutes. But in Yennefer's timeline he has clearly not been overthrown yet and he's referred to as being young. This clue is more ambiguous than the others, since the king is only referred to by name once, so the connection is not as clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n43:00 re: Tissaia: \"**King Dagorad** has banned mages from **Cintra** \\[...\\]\"\n\nStregobor:\"I've heard rumors he's taken ill. \\[...\\] \\[P\\]erhaps his **heiress** will be more pliable. **Princess**...\"\n\nTissaia: \"**Calanthe**? Good luck\"\n\nThere's much talk of kings in this episode, yet the connection here is about a princess who will have become queen by the time we first see her: Calanthe. This clue subtly differentiates all three timelines, building on the clues of 101 \"The End's Beginning\" and being the first time Calanthe is mentioned in Yennefer's timeline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Connecting themes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis episode focuses on Geralt's and Yennefer's storylines, while Ciri briefly appears in one scene at the end. As with the first two episodes, there are multiple themes that bind the storylines together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rebirth**\n\n01:06:51 re: \"It comes on a full moon… \\[...\\] When a wolf crosses a maiden's grave. A **pregnant girl** who died before her time. That **babe**... starts growing right in her **belly**. When it's big enough... that babe rips out. Only it ain't a babe no more\" (Mikal to Tsoka and Remus)\n\nThe opening lines of the episode set up the central theme of birth, a theme that connects the characters of Yennefer and the Striga-princess. One is the woman who sacrifices her chance to ever have a child, the other is the child eating its own dead mother: \"She grew inside Adda, feeding on her **petrified womb**. \\[...\\] An overgrown **abortion**\" (46:01 re, Geralt to Captain Segelin). Both transform from a **misshapen** „first draft of nature“ to what they are meant to be –- a powerful **sorceress** and a royal **princess**. Both are seen as abominations, Yennefer because of her elven blood and her hunchback appearance and the Striga because of the curse. The episode highlights this parallel in the Geralt v Striga fight sequence, by intercutting the fight with Yennefer‘s painful transformation. The sequence evolves into a scream-fest that would make any slasher-flick jealous, but the most symbolic part comes after the fight is done, when Yennefer and the unnamed young princess lie on the ground in a fetus position, cloaked in blood and filth. [NSFW link for the shot comparison (11:20 re)](http://imgur.com/a/klPowrI).\n\nYennefer is **transformed** through a painful, **bloody** ritual accompanied by Giltine‘s **chanting** in the elder language. The Striga is **made** through a curse, a ritual that Lord Ostrit describes in detail to Geralt: \"And then I recited some silly **chant**. And then I bathed in the **lamb's blood** until sunrise\" (22:21re) -- another bloody ritual where chanting is involved. The cost to make the Striga was the **mother‘s death**, and the cost for Yennefer‘s transformation is the **death of her womb**, as Giltine tells Yennefer: \"There is a cost to all creation. A **sacrifice** that is always made. To be **reborn**... you will **bear no more**\" (20:52 re), and sure enough, he proceeds to literally cut her uterus out. The themes of birth, the womb, sacrifice and dark ritual bind these two critical moments in both stories together, forever changing the lives of these two women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The price of power and the price of love**\n\n24:04 re: \"For all it brightens, **love** casts **long shadows**. I envy you, to live and to never have to fall in love\" (Foltest to Geralt)\n\nGeralt‘s storyline begins in a brothel, where he reminisces about Renfri while talking to the prostitute Danica, who asks about the scar on his thigh, a courtesy from the late princess. He seems to yearn for that short **moment of love** in the woods with her, but judging from his behaviour towards Danica, he is unable to have this connection with a stranger again. Later, when he meets Foltest for the last time on the bridge, he gives him Renfri‘s **brooch**, a gift for the young princess, and a constant reminder of love and pain for him. \"This isn't my first time trying to **save a princess** who others see as a monster\" (24:27 re), he tells Foltest, acknowledging that he himself never saw her as a **monster**. At the end of the episode, that brooch is returned to him by Triss, making it clear that it is now a part of him. Talking about his life of monsters and money, he tells Triss that \"it‘s all it needs to be\" (05:38 re). It seems that Renfri has left him scarred in more than one sense, making him fall back in his old life. And yet, he still gets involved, to save a princess; risking his life in the process. A monster but no money -- only a second chance to get right what he once failed at.\n\nFoltest has also paid a hefty price for the forbidden love with his sister, and he made **others pay**, too. The miner Tsoka lost his son Mikal to the Striga. Almost starting a revolt, the miners complain that there were \"years of attacks by this creature, and the king does nothing“ (1:00:04 re). Foltest of course doesn‘t want his daughter to be killed, accepting the deaths of his subjects. It is also the only reason he accepts Geralt‘s help, asking him with hesitation: \"Will my... will my **daughter**... be normal?\" (25:45 re). His own **mother** condemned the incestual relationship, seperating the siblings. Another consequence of this forbidden love, unbeknownst to the king, is the **betrayal** of Lord Ostrit, who made the curse and is therefore the one who's truly responsible: Triss realizes that \"countless are dead because of your **jealousy**\" (33:06 re). Of course, Lord Ostrit did it out of love for Adda, saying that Foltest \"didn't **love** her! I did\" (33:14 re).\n\nYennefer's price for her transformation is one that she will only truly understand in hindsight. \"I want to be **powerful**\" (28:53 re), she tells Istredd, to which he replies: \"Seen and **adored** with everyone watching\", referring to the sex scene that starts Yennefer‘s storyline in this episode, ending with applause: He knows that above all, she wants to be loved and admired. Their love breaks apart in this moment, undone by betrayal. \"It is what I‘m **owed**“, she says, making it clear that power is her way to get the love she deserves and that she will stop at nothing to get there. Tissaia already recognized this in 102 „Four Marks“: \"Your worst **fear** makes such sense. Even if you were a **beauty**, still, no one would love you“ (31:33 re). In the end, Yennefer‘s yearning for power and love is the very thing that forbids her the **unconditional love of her own child**. But the moment she realizes this, it‘s already too late. The transformation and initiation grant Yennefer power and beauty, but love and the yearning for love cast long shadows indeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Betrayal**\n\n32:31 re: \"Foltest will watch as Temeria turns against him\" (32:31 re, Lord Ostrit to Geralt and Triss)\n\nThe treason of Lord Ostrit is the most obvious betrayal that ties into the episode‘s title, \"Betrayer Moon\". Ever the hypocrite, Ostrit is the first one to talk of betrayal, telling the miners that \"you have my word that our king will not hear of this **treason**\" (58:10 re). \"Foltest commits treason\" (58:08 re), Tsoka replies, having talked about Nilfgaard‘s **uprising** before. There‘s much talk of **kings** in this episode, but also of **overthrowing** them, which makes the theme of betrayal and uprising tie into the clues. Foltest betrays his own subjects, while he himself was betrayed by Ostrit.\n\nIstredd‘s manipulation from last episode does not remain without consequences, robbing Yennefer of the chance to go to Aedirn instead of Nilfgaard, where the king rather \"fondle\\[s\\] his sorceress than listen to her\" (39:52 re), threatening the manifestation of her wish to be truly powerful. Istredd tries to justify himself: \"It was a test. It was, uh, an idiotic **manipulation**. Forgive me. \\[...\\] I had no way of knowing how the information would be used“. He also points out that \"we're pretending your precious rectoress never ordered you to **spy** on me\" (31:25 re), reminding Yennefer that there was manipulation on both sides, but only one ended up having consequences. His excuses can‘t save their relationship, which is now ended by naiveté and manipulation. As love casts long shadows, so does betrayal.\n\nCiri only appears in the last minutes of this episode which serve to tease her arrival in Brokilon forest. This scene seems like a betrayal since Ciri leaves a wounded Dara behind, seemingly ignoring his cries, but she‘s in a trance, not noticing anything around her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disregarding authority**\n\n27:14 re: Yennefer: \"You claim to be quite the artist. Prove it\"\n\nGiltine: \"The Chapter would have my head\"\n\nYennefer: \"Do they already have your cock?\"\n\nTrying to undo the damage caused by Istredd‘s betrayal, Yennefer has to go against the rules and the authority of the Brotherhood, as well as her mentor Tissaia. To save the princess and unearth the truth, Geralt decides to go against the king himself, taking quite a risk, first by forcing a private audience with Foltest, and then sneaking into the castle. Geralt is \"so quick to violence“ (26:23 re), ready to fight his way into the castle, as Foltest angrily remarks. Both Geralt and Yennefer succeed by finding their **own path** in this episode, disregarding authority figures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Destiny and something more**\n\n05:28 re: \"You say this is all life is to you, but there is a vortex of fate around all of us, Geralt, growing with each and everyone of our **choices**... drawing our **destinies** in closer. I feel something out there waits for you. **Something more**\" (Triss to Geralt)\n\nIn the last scene of Geralt‘s storyline, Triss discusses destiny with him. He‘s still recovering from the physical and emotional scars of the fight with the Striga (and with Renfri). He made the **choice** to save a princess, to get it right this time around. Triss recognizes this and doesn‘t believe his claim that monsters and money is all he needs. Geralt spent the episode haunted by the memory of Renfri, and now at the end, he is reminded that he has a **greater purpose** to fulfill -- and the episode cuts to Ciri, heading into the forest. \"The girl in the woods will be with you always, she is your destiny\" was the last line of episode 1, uttered by Renfri. The ending of this episode mirrors the ending of episode 1 in a way, subtly reminding the viewer of Geralt's and Ciri's connection. And soon we will find out about what caused this connection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading! I‘d love to read what you think about this. If you enjoyed this, I‘d also like to ask you to share these essays whenever you think it's appropriate and helpful.\n\n[Link to part four](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/ek5hs5/the_witcher_clues_and_connecting_themes_an/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[Link to part five](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/f0kgol/the_witcher_the_themes_connecting_the_main/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",

        "title": "The Witcher: Clues and connecting themes. An analysis of 103 \"Betrayer Moon\"",
        "body": "Spoilers for this episode and light spoilers for the first season.\n\nSince the launch of Season 1, it has become evident that a lot of people had problems with following the different timelines and the question has come up whether the show is too confusing or not. Others have criticized the narrative, which has been split into three character arcs, taking the focus away from the short stories. I want to identify the clues and themes and how they connect the storylines/timelines, hoping to provide some new grounds for deeper discussion with this analysis. Especially the themes are important to the overall narrative of the episode, since they connect the seemingly unrelated storylines on a deeper level. Welcome to part three!\n\n[Link to part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/eflu96/spoiler_the_witcher_clues_and_connecting_themes/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[Link to part two](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflixwitcher/comments/eg4aep/the_witcher_clues_and_connecting_themes_an/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n**Timestamps**: Netflix shows the remaining time if you pause, so I'll keep that format, marked with the abbreviation \"re\" for \"remaining\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 103 BETRAYER MOON\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Clues\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarting with something simple, if you follow [this link to imgur](http://imgur.com/a/V3S5XjX), you'll see **Stregobor** from two different episodes: 101 \"The End's beginning\" and now this episode. He certainly looks  **younger** in 103, where he has brown and well groomed **hair**, whereas in 101 his hair is unkept, white and grey, a reflection of his **age**. This is a visual clue indicating that Yennefer's storyline takes place years before Geralt's.\n\nAnother obvious clue is the fact that **Foltest** appears in both storylines; Geralt meets him when he is already an **old king** while Tissaia briefly meets him as a **young prince** in Yennefer's storyline, as well as his sister Adda and his mother, Queen Sancia (\"Foltest, leave your sister be\", 27:46 re). There's also an **old painting** of him and Adda on the walls of the old castle (37:10 re), which is shown before that scene, [here's the comparison](http://imgur.com/a/Ri67j9U). The **name \"Foltest\"** is first mentioned by Tsoka who tells Lord Ostrit that \"Foltest commits treason\" (58:08 re), his name is then repeated a lot of times throughout the episode. This is a noticeable clue that many viewers should be able to catch. It also builds on the Stregobor-clue by specifying the time gap between the two timelines; it's clear that there are at least a **couple of decades** between the storylines of Yennefer and Geralt at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n59:44 re \"My son \\[...\\] told me in Nilfgaard the **king** **diddled whores** while his **subjects starved**. Then someone came. The Usurper. And he rallied **the people**. And they **took back** what was theirs!\" (Tsoka to the miners)\n\n55:14 re: \"After **Nilfgaard** **overthrew** their **king**, the **Brotherhood** couldn't risk it happening again, so they sent me here\" (Triss to Geralt)\n\n42:45 re: Artorius: \"How fares **Nilfgaard**?\"\n\nVanielle of Brugge: \"**King** Fergus is proving to be an effective and excitable young king\"\n\nStregobor: \"**Horny**, she means. Spending the kingdom's money on **women** as his **people starve** to death\"\n\nTissaia: \"Fringilla will be in **Nilfgaard** by week's end. She will bring sanity and bread to **the people**\"\n\nThese clues occur in a relatively short time span in the episode, first we have the \"almost-revolt\" by the miners, mentioning the King of Nilfgaard. Triss mentions him again, making it clear that he was overthrown. In the revolt and the meeting of sorcerers it's mentioned that the young king lets his **people** starve while entertaining himself with prostitutes. But in Yennefer's timeline he has clearly not been overthrown yet and he's referred to as being young. This clue is more ambiguous than the others, since the king is only referred to by name once, so the connection is not as clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n43:00 re: Tissaia: \"**King Dagorad** has banned mages from **Cintra** \\[...\\]\"\n\nStregobor:\"I've heard rumors he's taken ill. \\[...\\] \\[P\\]erhaps his **heiress** will be more pliable. **Princess**...\"\n\nTissaia: \"**Calanthe**? Good luck\"\n\nThere's much talk of kings in this episode, yet the connection here is about a princess who will have become queen by the time we first see her: Calanthe. This clue subtly differentiates all three timelines, building on the clues of 101 \"The End's Beginning\" and being the first time Calanthe is mentioned in Yennefer's timeline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Connecting themes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis episode focuses on Geralt's and Yennefer's storylines, while Ciri briefly appears in one scene at the end. As with the first two episodes, there are multiple themes that bind the storylines together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rebirth**\n\n01:06:51 re: \"It comes on a full moon… \\[...\\] When a wolf crosses a maiden's grave. A **pregnant girl** who died before her time. That **babe**... starts growing right in her **belly**. When it's big enough... that babe rips out. Only it ain't a babe no more\" (Mikal to Tsoka and Remus)\n\nThe opening lines of the episode set up the central theme of birth, a theme that connects the characters of Yennefer and the Striga-princess. One is the woman who sacrifices her chance to ever have a child, the other is the child eating its own dead mother: \"She grew inside Adda, feeding on her **petrified womb**. \\[...\\] An overgrown **abortion**\" (46:01 re, Geralt to Captain Segelin). Both transform from a **misshapen** „first draft of nature“ to what they are meant to be –- a powerful **sorceress** and a royal **princess**. Both are seen as abominations, Yennefer because of her elven blood and her hunchback appearance and the Striga because of the curse. The episode highlights this parallel in the Geralt v Striga fight sequence, by intercutting the fight with Yennefer‘s painful transformation. The sequence evolves into a scream-fest that would make any slasher-flick jealous, but the most symbolic part comes after the fight is done, when Yennefer and the unnamed young princess lie on the ground in a fetus position, cloaked in blood and filth. [NSFW link for the shot comparison (11:20 re)](http://imgur.com/a/klPowrI).\n\nYennefer is **transformed** through a painful, **bloody** ritual accompanied by Giltine‘s **chanting** in the elder language. The Striga is **made** through a curse, a ritual that Lord Ostrit describes in detail to Geralt: \"And then I recited some silly **chant**. And then I bathed in the **lamb's blood** until sunrise\" (22:21re) -- another bloody ritual where chanting is involved. The cost to make the Striga was the **mother‘s death**, and the cost for Yennefer‘s transformation is the **death of her womb**, as Giltine tells Yennefer: \"There is a cost to all creation. A **sacrifice** that is always made. To be **reborn**... you will **bear no more**\" (20:52 re), and sure enough, he proceeds to literally cut her uterus out. The themes of birth, the womb, sacrifice and dark ritual bind these two critical moments in both stories together, forever changing the lives of these two women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The price of power and the price of love**\n\n24:04 re: \"For all it brightens, **love** casts **long shadows**. I envy you, to live and to never have to fall in love\" (Foltest to Geralt)\n\nGeralt‘s storyline begins in a brothel, where he reminisces about Renfri while talking to the prostitute Danica, who asks about the scar on his thigh, a courtesy from the late princess. He seems to yearn for that short **moment of love** in the woods with her, but judging from his behaviour towards Danica, he is unable to have this connection with a stranger again. Later, when he meets Foltest for the last time on the bridge, he gives him Renfri‘s **brooch**, a gift for the young princess, and a constant reminder of love and pain for him. \"This isn't my first time trying to **save a princess** who others see as a monster\" (24:27 re), he tells Foltest, acknowledging that he himself never saw her as a **monster**. At the end of the episode, that brooch is returned to him by Triss, making it clear that it is now a part of him. Talking about his life of monsters and money, he tells Triss that \"it‘s all it needs to be\" (05:38 re). It seems that Renfri has left him scarred in more than one sense, making him fall back in his old life. And yet, he still gets involved, to save a princess; risking his life in the process. A monster but no money -- only a second chance to get right what he once failed at.\n\nFoltest has also paid a hefty price for the forbidden love with his sister, and he made **others pay**, too. The miner Tsoka lost his son Mikal to the Striga. Almost starting a revolt, the miners complain that there were \"years of attacks by this creature, and the king does nothing“ (1:00:04 re). Foltest of course doesn‘t want his daughter to be killed, accepting the deaths of his subjects. It is also the only reason he accepts Geralt‘s help, asking him with hesitation: \"Will my... will my **daughter**... be normal?\" (25:45 re). His own **mother** condemned the incestual relationship, seperating the siblings. Another consequence of this forbidden love, unbeknownst to the king, is the **betrayal** of Lord Ostrit, who made the curse and is therefore the one who's truly responsible: Triss realizes that \"countless are dead because of your **jealousy**\" (33:06 re). Of course, Lord Ostrit did it out of love for Adda, saying that Foltest \"didn't **love** her! I did\" (33:14 re).\n\nYennefer's price for her transformation is one that she will only truly understand in hindsight. \"I want to be **powerful**\" (28:53 re), she tells Istredd, to which he replies: \"Seen and **adored** with everyone watching\", referring to the sex scene that starts Yennefer‘s storyline in this episode, ending with applause: He knows that above all, she wants to be loved and admired. Their love breaks apart in this moment, undone by betrayal. \"It is what I‘m **owed**“, she says, making it clear that power is her way to get the love she deserves and that she will stop at nothing to get there. Tissaia already recognized this in 102 „Four Marks“: \"Your worst **fear** makes such sense. Even if you were a **beauty**, still, no one would love you“ (31:33 re). In the end, Yennefer‘s yearning for power and love is the very thing that forbids her the **unconditional love of her own child**. But the moment she realizes this, it‘s already too late. The transformation and initiation grant Yennefer power and beauty, but love and the yearning for love cast long shadows indeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Betrayal**\n\n32:31 re: \"Foltest will watch as Temeria turns against him\" (32:31 re, Lord Ostrit to Geralt and Triss)\n\nThe treason of Lord Ostrit is the most obvious betrayal that ties into the episode‘s title, \"Betrayer Moon\". Ever the hypocrite, Ostrit is the first one to talk of betrayal, telling the miners that \"you have my word that our king will not hear of this **treason**\" (58:10 re). \"Foltest commits treason\" (58:08 re), Tsoka replies, having talked about Nilfgaard‘s **uprising** before. There‘s much talk of **kings** in this episode, but also of **overthrowing** them, which makes the theme of betrayal and uprising tie into the clues. Foltest betrays his own subjects, while he himself was betrayed by Ostrit.\n\nIstredd‘s manipulation from last episode does not remain without consequences, robbing Yennefer of the chance to go to Aedirn instead of Nilfgaard, where the king rather \"fondle\\[s\\] his sorceress than listen to her\" (39:52 re), threatening the manifestation of her wish to be truly powerful. Istredd tries to justify himself: \"It was a test. It was, uh, an idiotic **manipulation**. Forgive me. \\[...\\] I had no way of knowing how the information would be used“. He also points out that \"we're pretending your precious rectoress never ordered you to **spy** on me\" (31:25 re), reminding Yennefer that there was manipulation on both sides, but only one ended up having consequences. His excuses can‘t save their relationship, which is now ended by naiveté and manipulation. As love casts long shadows, so does betrayal.\n\nCiri only appears in the last minutes of this episode which serve to tease her arrival in Brokilon forest. This scene seems like a betrayal since Ciri leaves a wounded Dara behind, seemingly ignoring his cries, but she‘s in a trance, not noticing anything around her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disregarding authority**\n\n27:14 re: Yennefer: \"You claim to be quite the artist. Prove it\"\n\nGiltine: \"The Chapter would have my head\"\n\nYennefer: \"Do they already have your cock?\"\n\nTrying to undo the damage caused by Istredd‘s betrayal, Yennefer has to go against the rules and the authority of the Brotherhood, as well as her mentor Tissaia. To save the princess and unearth the truth, Geralt decides to go against the king himself, taking quite a risk, first by forcing a private audience with Foltest, and then sneaking into the castle. Geralt is \"so quick to violence“ (26:23 re), ready to fight his way into the castle, as Foltest angrily remarks. Both Geralt and Yennefer succeed by finding their **own path** in this episode, disregarding authority figures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Destiny and something more**\n\n05:28 re: \"You say this is all life is to you, but there is a vortex of fate around all of us, Geralt, growing with each and everyone of our **choices**... drawing our **destinies** in closer. I feel something out there waits for you. **Something more**\" (Triss to Geralt)\n\nIn the last scene of Geralt‘s storyline, Triss discusses destiny with him. He‘s still recovering from the physical and emotional scars of the fight with the Striga (and with Renfri). He made the **choice** to save a princess, to get it right this time around. Triss recognizes this and doesn‘t believe his claim that monsters and money is all he needs.

At the end of the episode, that brooch is returned to him by Triss, making it clear that it is now a part of him. Talking about his life of monsters and money, he tells Triss that \"it‘s all it needs to be\" (05:38 re). It seems that Renfri has left him scarred in more than one sense, making him fall back in his old life. And yet, he still gets involved, to save a princess; risking his life in the process. A monster but no money -- only a second chance to get right what he once failed at.\n\nFoltest has also paid a hefty price for the forbidden love with his sister, and he made **others pay**, too. The miner Tsoka lost his son Mikal to the Striga. Almost starting a revolt, the miners complain that there were \"years of attacks by this creature, and the king does nothing“ (1:00:04 re). Foltest of course doesn‘t want his daughter to be killed, accepting the deaths of his subjects. It is also the only reason he accepts Geralt‘s help, asking him with hesitation: \"Will my... will my **daughter**... be normal?\" (25:45 re). His own **mother** condemned the incestual relationship, seperating the siblings. Another consequence of this forbidden love, unbeknownst to the king, is the **betrayal** of Lord Ostrit, who made the curse and is therefore the one who's truly responsible: Triss realizes that \"countless are dead because of your **jealousy**\" (33:06 re). Of course, Lord Ostrit did it out of love for Adda, saying that Foltest \"didn't **love** her! I did\" (33:14 re).\n\nYennefer's price for her transformation is one that she will only truly understand in hindsight. \"I want to be **powerful**\" (28:53 re), she tells Istredd, to which he replies: \"Seen and **adored** with everyone watching\", referring to the sex scene that starts Yennefer‘s storyline in this episode, ending with applause: He knows that above all, she wants to be loved and admired. Their love breaks apart in this moment, undone by betrayal. \"It is what I‘m **owed**“, she says, making it clear that power is her way to get the love she deserves and that she will stop at nothing to get there. Tissaia already recognized this in 102 „Four Marks“: \"Your worst **fear** makes such sense. Even if you were a **beauty**, still, no one would love you“ (31:33 re). In the end, Yennefer‘s yearning for power and love is the very thing that forbids her the **unconditional love of her own child**. But the moment she realizes this, it‘s already too late. The transformation and initiation grant Yennefer power and beauty, but love and the yearning for love cast long shadows indeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Betrayal**\n\n32:31 re: \"Foltest will watch as Temeria turns against him\" (32:31 re, Lord Ostrit to Geralt and Triss)\n\nThe treason of Lord Ostrit is the most obvious betrayal that ties into the episode‘s title, \"Betrayer Moon\". Ever the hypocrite, Ostrit is the first one to talk of betrayal, telling the miners that \"you have my word that our king will not hear of this **treason**\" (58:10 re). \"Foltest commits treason\" (58:08 re), Tsoka replies, having talked about Nilfgaard‘s **uprising** before. There‘s much talk of **kings** in this episode, but also of **overthrowing** them, which makes the theme of betrayal and uprising tie into the clues. Foltest betrays his own subjects, while he himself was betrayed by Ostrit.\n\nIstredd‘s manipulation from last episode does not remain without consequences, robbing Yennefer of the chance to go to Aedirn instead of Nilfgaard, where the king rather \"fondle\\[s\\] his sorceress than listen to her\" (39:52 re), threatening the manifestation of her wish to be truly powerful. Istredd tries to justify himself: \"It was a test. It was, uh, an idiotic **manipulation**. Forgive me. \\[...\\] I had no way of knowing how the information would be used“. He also points out that \"we're pretending your precious rectoress never ordered you to **spy** on me\" (31:25 re), reminding Yennefer that there was manipulation on both sides, but only one ended up having consequences. His excuses can‘t save their relationship, which is now ended by naiveté and manipulation. As love casts long shadows, so does betrayal.\n\nCiri only appears in the last minutes of this episode which serve to tease her arrival in Brokilon forest. This scene seems like a betrayal since Ciri leaves a wounded Dara behind, seemingly ignoring his cries, but she‘s in a trance, not noticing anything around her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disregarding authority**\n\n27:14 re: Yennefer: \"You claim to be quite the artist. Prove it\"\n\nGiltine: \"The Chapter would have my head\"\n\nYennefer: \"Do they already have your cock?\"\n\nTrying to undo the damage caused by Istredd‘s betrayal, Yennefer has to go against the rules and the authority of the Brotherhood, as well as her mentor Tissaia. To save the princess and unearth the truth, Geralt decides to go against the king himself, taking quite a risk, first by forcing a private audience with Foltest, and then sneaking into the castle. Geralt is \"so quick to violence“ (26:23 re), ready to fight his way into the castle, as Foltest angrily remarks. Both Geralt and Yennefer succeed by finding their **own path** in this episode, disregarding authority figures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Destiny and something more**\n\n05:28 re: \"You say this is all life is to you, but there is a vortex of fate around all of us, Geralt, growing with each and everyone of our **choices**... drawing our **destinies** in closer. I feel something out there waits for you. **Something more**\" (Triss to Geralt)\n\nIn the last scene of Geralt‘s storyline, Triss discusses destiny with him. He‘s still recovering from the physical and emotional scars of the fight with the Striga (and with Renfri). He made the **choice** to save a princess, to get it right this time around. Triss recognizes this and doesn‘t believe his claim that monsters and money is all he needs. Geralt spent the episode haunted by the memory of Renfri, and now at the end, he is reminded that he has a **greater purpose** to fulfill -- and the episode cuts to Ciri, heading into the forest. \"The girl in the woods will be with you always, she is your destiny\" was the last line of episode 1, uttered by Renfri. The ending of this episode mirrors the ending of episode 1 in a way, subtly reminding the viewer of Geralt's and Ciri's connection. And soon we will find out about what caused this connection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading! I‘d love to read what you think about this.

Rankings within tier, particularly lower down within a tier, are rather tenuous.\n\nNot Cronge/Baste Tier (characters who the show should have used more):\n\n1. Jaskier: Starts off as terrible but quickly becomes baste\n\n1. Geralt: Baste and crimson-elixered. needed more of him though.\n\n1. Cahir: Very cool dude. every moment he was on screen was a delight. particularly the part where he was on screen twice at once.\n\n1. Ciri: Somehow well done. probably because she just has to act scared and run the whole seaon. still i actually cared about her so that's something. kinda cronge how she did the whole 'scream to solve your problems' thing.\n\n1. Zola/goldencheeks: did nothing wrong and was nice to ciri so that's cool.\n\n1. foltest: a tragic character, redeemed at the end. just a star-crossed lover, but had all the intangibles to belong in baste tier.\n\n1. yurga: brave but stupid\n\n1. eist: the definition of baste. loses points for marrying calanthe.\n\n1. Vilgefortz: Cool but stupid. did very little for how much he showed up. only in this tier instead of 'not a character tier' because he's hot.\n\n1. tea/vea. not much to say here. fearless and cool. this is how you do warrior women, not like calanthe or the dryads.\n\n1. boholt: badass but stupid.\n\n1. queen kalis: showed that you should never give up. an excellent example that you can make no mistake but still die. the part where she talked about feeling objectified was cronge though.\n\n1. lazlo: selfless, baste, and one-dimensional\n\n1. duny: kinda cronge how he came for pavetta when he started being into her before she was born. still baste for fighting into the courtroom though.\n\n1. doppler: very hot in his original form. loses points for letting himself get captured by cahir instead of going after ciri. that was just stupid.\n\n1. chireadan: pretty cool. bit of a naicegai though.\n\n1. yarpen zigrin: almost cronge tier because it still kind of annoys me that media still portray dwarves with some antizemitic attributes. putting that aside, though, he was ok.\n\n1. borch: kind of degrading to refer to tea/vea as his weapons but otherwise he's pretty cool.\n\nNot a Character Tier (These are characters with such a small role they had no opportunity to do anything wrong. The show could have used them more as long as it wasn't at the expense of time with the good characters. rankings in this tier are quite tenuous.):\n\n1. triss. should have showed up more. barely did anything. even the one episode she was a major part of wasn't that memorable.\n\n1. dara: barely had a purpose beyond deus ex machina for ciri.\n\n1. princess adda: gives us a cool fight scene. obviously not a character though.\n\n1. danek: i liked him. filler character though.\n\n1. Istredd: only in this tier instead of cronge tier because his conversations with yennefer showed that she is by far crongier than him.\n\n1. mousesack: just wastes time and doesn't even contribute to character development like istredd does (though he does so poorly)\n\n1. Stregobor: Is on screen a lot but doesn't really do much...\n\n1. hooded mage at battle of sodden hill: more of an obstacle than a character. i think he's in another episode too but i can't remember.\n\n1. nohorn.\n\n1. marilka. more of a plot device than a character.\n\n1. ma/visenna: just more deus ex machina\n\n1. eithne: didn't really do anything. anything she said that was supposed to be important for ciri just fell flat.\n\n1. dryad general: would be in cronge tier if she hadn't almost done something by butting heads with eithne.\n\n1. artorius: yet another wasted mage.\n\n1. vanielle: who?\n\n1. king virfuril: not a bad thing to be in this tier, not every character can be major. don't think he shouldve been on screen more though.\n\nCronge Tier, with the worst first (These are the characters the show really ruined/should have used far less. Characters listed at the top of this tier were significantly worse than characters further down):\n\n1. Yennefer. gold standard of a ruined character. perverse sekz stuff going on with her, and gave psychedelics to little girls too. her screen time and triss's should have been flipped. the first time she did the 'scream to solve your problems thing' was super cronge. the second wasn't, but she was already ruined. also does more objectively terrible stuff.\n\n1. calanthe. very cronge character.\n\n1. toruviel: whiny\n\n1. ostrit: inn-sell\n\n1. filavandrel: coward\n\n1. eyck: tried to change the world for kingdom and glory. was killed for it like jfk. unfortunately he was so over the top, unrealistic parody (the word escapes me) that the character is ruined.\n\n1. pavetta: quite cronge. all she did was the 'scream to solve your problems' thing.\n\n1. fringilla: it personally offends me that they would make this character blakk when she's a villain. i would prefer it if that only happened for the 'good guys'. regardless, she's a brainlitt.\n\n1. renfri: slightly less cronge than yennefer. still pretty cronge how she acted like such a massive victim (which she admittedly was) despite clearly being a terrible person\n\n1. crach an craite: like eyck but not as bad\n\n1. tissaia: don't know why, but she's just kinda cronge.\n\n1. sabrina: looks goofy and was kinda boring.\n\n1. torque: looks goofy",

        "body": "If I were the creators of The Witcher I'd be extremely upset right now. Both Darren Franich and Kristen Baldwin currently have a rotten review with a rating of F, citing the same article, which they co-wrote, on Rotten Tomatoes right now. The critics score is sitting at 59%. So not only was it an incredibly unprofessional review, it's having a doubly weighted impact.\n\nThey're also both considered Top Critics on the site, by the way.\n\nRotten Tomatoes is, like it or not, pretty influential in movie and TV pop culture today. It's completely absurd that an article like that would be counted once let alone twice, and be considered a product of \"top critics.\" I'm sure that little green splat is having a negative effect on the viewership of the show, as silly as that may be.\n\nEdit: For all the people who continue to post things like \"who cares?\" or \"maybe the show sucks!\" or \"what does one review matter?\" You're missing the point. Do me a favor and watch this, it'll explain better than I can https://youtu.be/p4MeaGBGz7I",

It is one of the biggest music festivals in Poland. For example, in 2020 there will be: Twenty One Pilots, Asap Rocky, Taylor Swift.\n\nRight now ALMOST **55,000** PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED!!! I know we can at least double that number ;)\n\nImagine thousands of people singing together leading by Joey! I know it is possible, because in 2019 there was panel with cast from Stranger Things as a promotion of a third season! (link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bQT4cGyjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90bQT4cGyjg)). So Netflix has connections there \\^\\^.\n\nThe organizer of the event was so surprised with that amount of interested people, that he really wrote to Opener organizers ;)\n\nPlease mama Lauren, uncle Tomek, daddy Henry, beloved Joey or whoever from the cast (haven't admitted it yet!) reads our reddit page. Share that information to Netflix and the PR team!\n\nEveryone JOIN and invite *your witchers* (friends!):  [https://www.facebook.com/events/2269095180054441/](https://www.facebook.com/events/2269095180054441/)Netflix!

        "body": "Honestly, I cannot see a single redeeming quality in her and it kinda leaves me in a ...confused state while watching the show.  \n  \nThe idea of her tragic backstory for gaining sympathy was solid for me - an \"ugly\" unloved nobody who is being traded for less than cattle getting a chance to become powerful and finally turning her life around. I also see great potential in this \"magician plastic surgery\" causing future conflict as you feel like anything you get is just because of artificial beauty and that nothing is real anymore. All snippets for an intriguing character - however, it just doesn't work for me.  \n  \nIn essence, she behaves like an edgy emo teenager who knows everything best. She made a conscious decision to trade her fertility for beauty. Plastic magician even asked twice if she is sure about this. Now she suddenly sees it as the biggest loss in her life that was \"forced on her\", and CONSTANTLY blames the world for taking the most important thing to her. Are you kidding me? On top of it, all we see is ugly sides of her. She manipulates rulers with her beauty; she is feared by others in every environment we see her; she constantly just \"wants everything\" with no regard to anything or anyone, even if it's some ridiculous childish myth she's chasing; she criticizes everything and everyone even with little to no knowledge about their circumstances; looks down on strategies of experienced leaders while having zero knowledge in this regard; and in general is just gloomy and negative.  \nHonestly, when Istredd rejected her it was kind of a golden moment for me in this series. Given that he was the only person who liked her for the \"real her\", I felt like this romance was a great opportunity for Yennefer's central conflict as well. But with such an unlikable character, I didn't really care and was just glad she didn't get what she wants with him honestly.  \n  \nFollowing that, I also found the romance with Geralt a bit off. He just liked her because she is beautiful like all the other girls, we don't really see much of what makes her special all of a sudden. The whole \"you're so important to me\" part came out of nowhere, there was no meaningful bonding going beyond other monster of the week encounters.  \n  \nI'd be curious if she was similar in the books or if she was more likeable. Or is it just me who doesn't like her? I haven't read a single book and only have vague memories of the games, but I don't really remember disliking her as much as I do in this series.  \n  \nSo yeah, is this just me? What's your opinion of her? I only found a lot of hate about Triss in this series, so I assume this might be an unpopular opinion :D.",

He had left the village and she could have gone on her killing spree without Geralt knowing. Why go back to him?\n\n2) When Yennifer first portals to Aretuza, the dude tells her that \"she\" would be looking for her. \"She\" was Tessaia, who seemed alright, why did he tell Yennifer to run?\n\n3) What was up with the people watching Yen and the dude having sex and clapping?\n\n4) Why wasnt Yen pushed into the pool? She performed very poorly in rock lifting, thunder catching (where the thunder went inside her? What happened there?) and mind other shit so why did Tessaia not mark her out as useless?",

        "body": "There is a reason why most successful Fantasy/Sci Fi epics from LOTR to the MCU start small and end big. They have to build up characters we care about, get to know them, and do a lot world building so we understand what the stakes are and why we should care about them. For whatever reason the show runners in The Witcher do quite literally the exact opposite & in doing so fumble the story badly. Right away they start big with these massive esoteric political machinations that it took other franchises years & multiple films to build up to, and here they just throw it all at you with no real care. Even the latter episodes where it begins to retrace it steps to attempt to explain it all isn't enough to make up for its jumbled and convoluted story line. Were they trying to be so different & unique that they thought that by telling the story out of order it would something really cool and avant garde? \n\nCiri, the child princess on the run, has no character development. I think the show wants us to think that because we get a brief glimpse of her playing with street children shes kind of street smart? Then it shows her as being cold and alone trying to survive by herself but does she ever grow as a person? I can't tell based on the information the show gives us if we're supposed to think she was a spoiled brat who always got her way & now has to deal with the real world or was she always a tom boyish self sufficient person? I feel like I was getting mixed messages there. Who in the world were the people in the forest that took her in, what's their role in all this & why do they matter? None of this is explored or explained in any meaningful way. I never felt Siri was humanized once the entire time, she just matters because of her birthright & that was it. \n\nYennefer's story arc came across like a chintzy Hallmark/SyFy made for TV movie. In the span of two episodes she goes from being a hunchback farm hand to an influential sorceress. Aretuza is no Hogwarts let just say that right now, and I know its not supposed to be, but they really just rushed her through there so we can finally see her as a beautiful and powerful witch DECADES later?! Her time in Aretuza should've been an entire season's worth of storytelling but they rushed it so she could have her romance with Geralt. In the final episodes Yennefer goes back as an alumni to her academy and there's this incredibly cheesy wizards council meeting where they throw around all this political and geographical jargon & we have no idea what any of it means. There is almost no attempt at any meaningful world building here so that in the final battle I have no idea of anyone's motivations or drives or what their cause for fighting for is. I want to care but it doesn't give me a reason to. \n\nI think in the end this first season is only salvageable because of how Cavil looks as Geralt. He has some neat sword fights but that doesn't make up for the fact that he is put in a world that never bothers explaining itself or him for that matter. The entire season I was waiting for that moment where we can understand his vulnerabilities and his self perspective in the greater world. We barely get glimpse of that in a minor flashback in the very end but it wasn't enough. As a major fantasy geek I really wanted to to like this show so I hope in the next season they fire script writer and hire better people. This obviously has the potential to be something better but they started off poorly. \n\n(I want to acknowledge this is its own unique IP & that though on based books and beloved games, is a TV show unto itself. I didn't judge it because of any preconceived notions that I had about the games or books)\n\nEDIT: Now that I think about it the only other show I can recall recently that did this out of order storytelling was HBO's Westworld. In the first season it was a neat parallel timeline that paid off in the finale. However when it did it it still felt restrained and fluid that we really didn't always know if it was indeed a parallel timeline until the very end. They tried to ramp it up even more in S2 by messing with the timeline and I think it really didn't work the 2nd time around.",

Even the latter episodes where it begins to retrace it steps to attempt to explain it all isn't enough to make up for its jumbled and convoluted story line. Were they trying to be so different & unique that they thought that by telling the story out of order it would something really cool and avant garde? \n\nCiri, the child princess on the run, has no character development. I think the show wants us to think that because we get a brief glimpse of her playing with street children shes kind of street smart? Then it shows her as being cold and alone trying to survive by herself but does she ever grow as a person? I can't tell based on the information the show gives us if we're supposed to think she was a spoiled brat who always got her way & now has to deal with the real world or was she always a tom boyish self sufficient person? I feel like I was getting mixed messages there. Who in the world were the people in the forest that took her in, what's their role in all this & why do they matter? None of this is explored or explained in any meaningful way. I never felt Siri was humanized once the entire time, she just matters because of her birthright & that was it. \n\nYennefer's story arc came across like a chintzy Hallmark/SyFy made for TV movie. In the span of two episodes she goes from being a hunchback farm hand to an influential sorceress. Aretuza is no Hogwarts let just say that right now, and I know its not supposed to be, but they really just rushed her through there so we can finally see her as a beautiful and powerful witch DECADES later?! Her time in Aretuza should've been an entire season's worth of storytelling but they rushed it so she could have her romance with Geralt. In the final episodes Yennefer goes back as an alumni to her academy and there's this incredibly cheesy wizards council meeting where they throw around all this political and geographical jargon & we have no idea what any of it means. There is almost no attempt at any meaningful world building here so that in the final battle I have no idea of anyone's motivations or drives or what their cause for fighting for is. I want to care but it doesn't give me a reason to. \n\nI think in the end this first season is only salvageable because of how Cavil looks as Geralt. He has some neat sword fights but that doesn't make up for the fact that he is put in a world that never bothers explaining itself or him for that matter. The entire season I was waiting for that moment where we can understand his vulnerabilities and his self perspective in the greater world. We barely get glimpse of that in a minor flashback in the very end but it wasn't enough. As a major fantasy geek I really wanted to to like this show so I hope in the next season they fire script writer and hire better people. This obviously has the potential to be something better but they started off poorly. \n\n(I want to acknowledge this is its own unique IP & that though on based books and beloved games, is a TV show unto itself. I didn't judge it because of any preconceived notions that I had about the games or books)\n\nEDIT: Now that I think about it the only other show I can recall recently that did this out of order storytelling was HBO's Westworld. In the first season it was a neat parallel timeline that paid off in the finale. However when it did it it still felt restrained and fluid that we really didn't always know if it was indeed a parallel timeline until the very end. They tried to ramp it up even more in S2 by messing with the timeline and I think it really didn't work the 2nd time around.",

So there were a couple things I was confused about and I’m not sure if it’s because I’m stupid and missed stuff or if it’s because i don’t know the video games/books. Anyway here are my questions \n\n1. What is the time span between yen being taken and yen transforming? \n\n2. What was the wish that geralt made that stopped the genie thing from killing yen? How did it bind them and why did it make yen so pissed when the golden dragon guy mentioned it \n\n3. What was special about renfri? I know that the older mage was for some reason positive that all of these girls born on a certain night were like the devil, but why was renfri so important to him? Was she just the last one left? \n\n4. Are jaskier and geralt meeting up different times throughout years or are all of their scenes together taking place in the same few weeks? \n\n5. What is the time span between cintra burning and ciri finding geralt? I thought that when she was at the refugee camp one of the people said it had been a year? \n\n6. Can someone explain the nilfgaard escalation to me? Is the nilfgaardian who was at Pavetta’s marriage dinner the same nilgaardian who yen was supposed to advise? I’m confused on that timeline in general. I know that yen was supposed to advise someone from there, at some point there was an uprising then the rightful heir took back control (I think), and  nilfgaard burned cintra. But I’m not sure what order that happened in",

Geralt’s relationship with Triss in the show is limited to lifting the Striga curse and nothing more, so I don’t see how asking her for help would make any sense in the show.\n\nAlthough I would’ve preferred the show to stay closer to the books overall, I see this as a good change given how much has already been changed as is.\n\n\nGiven the rumours of \"A grain of truth\" being included in the show I imagine this might take place before Geralt and Ciri make it to Kaer Morhen. I think something will abduct Ciri and Geralt will track it to the mansion where he finds Nivellen and Ciri, they establish that Nivellen means no harm and wasn’t the one who abducted Ciri (it was Vereena) the rest plays out more or less the same way as the books. \n\nThis gives Ciri some much needed insight into what it means to be a witcher, since in the show she doesn’t seem to know much/anything about witchers or at least about Geralt, as opposed to the books where she grew up with stories about Geralt and knowing about how she was promised to him through the law of surprise.\n\nWhat changes are you expecting or hoping will/will not happen?",

So my question is: how would Yennefer know when 20 minutes have passed?

Or will the main part of the battle be in season 2 when the armies actually arrived or what???? \n\nThere were supposed to be 100 thousand! soldiers fighting in this battle of which more than 30thousand died, the battle was huge and brutal. Most of the main northern realms participated in the battle (Temeria, Redania, Aedirn, Kaedwen) , even some reinforcements from Skellige took part in the battle too to stop the mighty Nilfgaard Empire. \n\nAnd what we have got in the series? A lame brawl between 22 mages and some peasants on one side and a few hundrets ugly looking Nilfgaardians on the other, and Foltest arriving with his army after everyone is dead lol. He must got there and be like: \"Shit guys, looks like we´re late, but that was fuckin easy\" Like really the mighty Nilfgaard empire, the empire which would defeat and conquer all North is defeated by 20 mages and bunch of peasants? :DDD Go to hell with such nonsense.\n\nThat was really a huge dissapoinment in otherwise good show. And I thought Battle of Winterfell was bad.  \n\nI know everything couldm´t be exactly as in the books and I tolerated all the differences and alterations made in the show, but this was just waaay to much. They took one of the most important battles in Witcher universe a turned it into what??? What was that? That wasnt´t even a battle. There was just one (and small) army. Damn that was really bad. Srsly for the first seven episodes I would give the show rating of like 80-85%, really good. But the last one is a big fat 0 that was absolutelly shit.",

        "body": "If there was one character I was disappointed we never got to meet in the first season, it's Nenneke. Now, I can sort of rationalize how we never saw her making sense with the show's ever shifting timeline. But while the Temple of Melitele was mentioned this season, Nenneke was not. And she is the archpriestess.\n\nI'd like it if we could get actually get Lady Nenneke next season. She has a wonderful relationship with Geralt. This season really nailed Geralt and Jaskier, IMO. I think Geralt and Nenneke is also good because it shows that Geralt has a woman not unlike a mother to him, who is basically like his surrogate mother.\n\nNenneke is also a strong female character who isn't like a \"badass.\" What I mean is, she has strength of integrity, attitude, and personality and does all that without fighting. But she has this real amazing relationship with Geralt.\n\nAlso, I think Nenneke could serve as a great foil for Tissaia. Not exactly like an archenemy or rival for Tissaia, but to show the dichotomy of those two characters. Tissaia is rather cunning, manipulative and ruthless. Nenneke is a more encouraging, supportive and nurturing presence, especially for Geralt. \n\nIt doesn't have to happen this way, but at some point, Geralt should be severely injured and taken to the temple to heal where we see Nenneke. They can already have a longstanding established relationship.\n\nI feel if Lauren Hissrich and the production play their cards right with Nenneke she could be a showstealer and another strong female presence for the show. I think she's one of the best characters Sapkowski created.",

If they don't have what it takes, they are dealt with so they don't have a bunch of half cocked spellcasters running around. In this case, turning them into eels. That part was pretty straightforward.\n\nHere are the parts I can't seem to figure out.\n\nFor one, what do those girls think is happening when Tissaia is turning them into eels? Because if they know they are about to spend the rest of there lives as eels, I don't understand why they would be so chill about it. \n\nSecondly, what does it mean that they are a conduit for Aretuza? Is it making that location more magical for some benefit I didn't catch, or does it have something to do with that \"synthetic chaos\" comment Filavandrel made? If the latter, does that mean humans can only cast spells if that pool is full of magic eels?",

        "title": "Ciri's Journey- Geography oversight that's bothering me now...",
        "body": "So I was just looking at a map of the Northern Kingdoms after watching the show through a second watch and I realized that they made a pretty ridiculous oversight in the geography that makes a lot of Ciri's plotline not make any sense. Allow me to walk through Ciri's journey throughout season 1, and then I'll link to the map which will hopefully show how this really doesn't make a lot of sense. Needless to say, this will have small spoilers for Ciri's story throughout the season.\n\n1. **Episode 1:** Ciri is in Cintra during the siege and sacking of Cintra. \n2. **Episode 2:** Ciri wanders through the woods for three days, meets Dara, then finds a Cintran refugee camp in the woods. The camp is sacked and Ciri is forced to flee with Dara.\n3. **Episode 3:** In a trance, Ciri ends up walking into Brokilon Forest.\n4. **Episode 4:** Ciri is still in Brokilon. Cahir learns through Nilfgaardian magics that Ciri is in Brokilon Forest.\n5. **Episode 5:** Cahir sends the doppler to Brokilon to bring Ciri back to him.\n6. **Episode 6:** Ciri leaves Brokilon, discovers that Mousesack is a doppler and runs away. The doppler disguised as Ciri gets caught in the nearby woods by Cahir and then tries to kill him.\n7. **Episode 7:** Ciri comes to a random unnamed village. When asked where she's going she says Skellige, and asks how long of a journey it is to the coast. She's about a week away by horse. She sees a play on the street mocking the sacking of Cintra. She steals Clip (or Clop) and rides off only to be ambushed by her former \"friends\" from Cintra. All of this implies that she's still not too far away from Cintra\n8. **Episode 8:** The battle of Sodden happens under the justification that there are scout reports that Ciri may have already crossed the Yaruga into the northern kingdoms, leading Cahir to decide to stage an early attack before waiting for backup to stay on her tail.  Ciri and Geralt meet up at Yurga's house.  We know from the books that Yurga lived just across the Yaruga river on the Cintran side, and in the show, Yurga's wife explains to Ciri that the Nilfgaardians are going the other way and they have no reason to come this way so they're safe. Geralt runs across the wreckage of the Cintran refugee camp that Ciri was in Episode 2.\n\nThis plot all sounds okay until you look at the [map of the Northern Kingdoms (link)](https://imgur.com/EE99vlz). As you can see, Brokilon forest is north of the Yaruga, bordering Verden, Brugge, and Temeria. So this basically means that Ciri had to cross the Yaruga into Brokilon, then cross it back into Cintra, and then get close to Sodden on the Cintran side, which is in the opposite direction of the coast where she had wanted to get a boat to Skellige. Meanwhile Cahir would have KNOWN that Ciri was already North of the Yaruga because he knew she was in Brokilon, so the scout report that she may have already crossed the Yaruga makes no sense and the motivation for the Battle of Sodden becomes more questionable. Not only that, but Cahir and the doppler must have already crossed the Yaruga to get to Brokilon when Cahir captures fake Ciri in episode 6. Not only that, but this scouting report turns out to be false because Ciri had somehow not yet crossed the Yaruga. So Cahir knew that she had crossed the Yaruga into Brokilon, but the impetus behind his attack on Sodden Hill was a rumour that she MAY have crossed the Yaruga, when it turns out, she somehow hadn't crossed the Yaruga after all.\n\nThe only way that this can make any geographic sense is if they moved Brokilon Forest to be somewhere south of the Yaruga, in Cintra. But this also has its own share of issues in the established (TV show) lore. Queen Calanthe is depicted as extremely xenophobic of the non-human races, mages, etc. If Brokilon was in Cintra, then why does she allow it to persist when she famously routed the elves from her land with an outright genocide, blames the once-cursed Duny for Pavetta's death, and will not allow the Brotherhood of Sorcerers to hold any sway over her kingdom?\n\nThen there's the silliness of her claiming to want to go to Skellige but somehow getting further and further away from the coast, because Cintra is a coastal city.\n\nOn another note, the show has Geralt arriving from the opposite direction as the books as he was already in Cintra when the sack happened, compared to the books where he was trying to get to Cintra from Temeria and was too late.\n\nI still really liked the show and am hyped for season 2, but this one detail is bothering me quite a lot because it makes no sense. Ciri's journey was already the most heavily padded to stall for time for the timelines to converge, but for some reason this detail really bugs me, and I just wanted to share it to see if anyone else noticed it.\n\nThoughts?\n\nTL;DR- Ciri's entire journey makes no sense when you consider the actual geography of the Northern Kingdoms and the placement of Brokilon Forest.",

        "body": "Just finished reading Time of Contempt and Boy was that a wild ride. Such a great book. I am phone so I won't write much, but there are some things I can't get out of my head right now.\n\nFirst of all how old was Shani at that time? The way she was described sounded like really young. \n\nThe whole chapter with lawyers was good but that chapter really changed my mind about the whole Clanthe's Character. That whole section was really really well written. And gave another dimension to Clanthe. \n\nThe coup part was really really good. It was done really well. And on a side note. It could be The witcher (TV shows') red wedding moment. That chapter and next chapter can make really really great episodes if done right. And I would hope they do them justice.\n\nNow my favorite chapter. Where Ciri was stranded on the Desert. The whole her need for survival. Her licking the stones and blade for some moisture or her even thinking that she should drink her own blood for survival was so so great. I was really blown away by that whole sequence minus the Unicorn. I really didn't like the Unicorn part. I don't know why. But it really didn't make it for me. But it's still my favorite chapter with the coup chapter. \n\nNow I can't really remember anything from the last chapter except the fucking Ciri and Mistle's really really weird relationship. Man that was fucked up. She was raped by someone who saved her from getting raped. And I have a feeling that I am not going to like this stockholm syndrome relationship. This really upset me to a point of actually leaving the books. It fucked up. And I know fucked up things happen in the universe. But I am not saying that rape weirded me out but Ciri kissing Mistle's after waking up in the morning upset me. I am feeling like this relationship is going in the direction that I don't really feel it should. Unless I am misreading something. \n\n\nWell I am going to continue reading. I really love these books. They are really really good. Time for Baptism of fire.",

        "title": "The Critics of the Show are Correct",
        "body": "Preface: I've read all the Witcher books, and played The Witcher 2, and The Witcher 3. I'm a huge fan of the series, and was pumped for the Netflix release. This show has received a moderate to low score from critics, and people are railing on them for that reason. While some critics made egregious decisions like skipping episodes, or skimming through them, I do believe that the Rotten Tomatoes scoring(56%) is more or less appropriate.\n\nThis show is not without merit, like its sound design, and Henry Cavil's portrayal of Geralt, but I'm going to focus on the points the lowered the viewing experience for me:\n\n***Some lines, and actions by the characters make no sense in context.***\n\nIn the first episode Geralt asserts that trying to kill Stregobor makes Renfri a monster. This is the complete opposite of what that scene is intended to depict. In the books Geralt refused both Stregobor, and Renfri's offers to kill the other, and only intervened when Renfri threatened to kill the people at the market. While that does happen to an extent in the show, it doesn't absolve that scene.\n\nLater in the same episode when Ciri is escaping Cintra, she all of a sudden asks about why she has been protected all her life. The gut reaction should be: \"Because she's a princess, duh!\". That line doesn't even belong to that scene. It's one of chaos and panic, and she should be in shock of her grandmother's impending death, and afraid of the invasion.\n\nIn Ep2, Geralt asks Filavandrel to go somewhere else, and rebuild. which is in direct contradiction to the fact that elves are dying out, and have no land of theirs to go to, which is the reason they hide, and steal grain.\n\nThere is this woman in Ep8 who just wants to help Ciri no matter what. She even trudges out into the wilderness, to find Ciri sitting at a blast impact site, surrounded by mangled bodies, and she responds by saying that it'll all be okay, and that it's alright that they're dead since they came for her. This is an audience serving scene. The woman doesn't know what Ciri means by \"they came for me\". Maybe she's a vampire in disguise. Maybe she's a rogue mage, etc. The audience knows the truth, but the woman does not, and her reaction is stupid.\n\nPavetta seems awfully happy to be married to Duny, by her mother. The same mother who tried to kill him moments ago.\n\nYennefer says she would vote to burn it all down when talking about Aretuza in Ep7. She says she doesn't care. When Tissaia begs her to come along, she scorns the appeal by questioning whether Tissaia has ever used the word \"please\" before. Yet, in Ep8, she's on her way to Sodden with the other mages, for no apparent reason. She acts like the most zealous, and willful of the lot, encouraging others to not give up. Did the writers forget Yennefer's character?\n\nThe most out of place reaction seemed to be when Tissaia and Yennefer were smiling at each other while Yennefer shoveled her eel-transformed classmates into the pool. I would expect shock, or horror, or fear, maybe even anger. I wouldn't expect her to feel proud of not being turned into an eel.\n\n***Magic sucks***\n\nTissaia apparently said that Yennefer was her best student, while we see Yennefer fail over, and over, and never grow from it, or succeed. In Ep4, Yennefer struggles to keep a portal up, while defending against the assassin mage. Yennefer never seems to have any original insight into magic, as we see her follow Tissaia's lead, and apes whatever she says. When Tissaia tells her to reserve chaos, she does. When she tells her to unleash, she does. Yennefer is supposed to be the best, and an independent sorceress, and all she does is follow orders.\n\nTissaia herself gets pitiful treatment at the last episode battle at Sodden. She just gets incapacitated with dimeritium, when it appeared that she was going to jump into the fray, and show us what the rectoress of Aretuza is capable of.\n\nAll of this ties into my point about magic in the series as a whole. Maybe they didn't have a big enough budget, but magic in the witcher is supposed to be a spectacle, not the pitiful \"force\" as they mostly depicted it. For some reason they made fire magic a \"forbidden magic\", and gave Triss plant raising abilities. But then Yennefer is able to conjure fire, without ever learning how to. Sabrina is downright bizarrely treated, once shown as an extremely talented mage in Aretuza, then relegated to shooting a bow and arrow in Sodden. The two witcher signs, quen, and aard that are used in the show both look the same generic blue. The Brokilon sap doesn't work on Ciri, and no one cares why, etc, etc.\n\nThe doppler says that he now knows every thought, and action Mousesack took, yet fails to answer correctly to Ciri's questions regarding Mousesack's past, and gets caught. The acting in general in that episode was really iffy, with it being quite obvious that it was not Mousesack.\n\nThe dragon effects are horrible, and Villentretenmerth looks goofy. In that same episode Geralt and Yennefer take the time to kiss in the middle of the fight, while Geralt is casting aard.\n\nThe made the mages one-trick ponies. Looks like the witcher took inspiration from anime, and every mage has to have only one thing they can do. Yennefer has mind-control/telepathy (good), Triss controls small plants (yeesh), Vilgefortz can summon a sword (yeesh), Sabrina shoots a bow and arrow (mega yeesh), one mage has jedi force powers (good), Tissaia has nothing (giga yeesh), and that's about it. They seem to have some abilities in common, like making portals probably, and capturing lightning, but those are highly esoteric, and most mages in the show just focus on one stupid gimmick, and they don't even do it well. Mages in witcher are terrifyingly powerful, and need to be taken by surprise to take down. Not even a witcher can hope to take a mage one-on-one. But what we get is Triss flailing to create some vines to block a door, and Vilgefortz getting out of mana after summoning a sword three times.\n\nThe Nilfgaardian mages are cartoonish. Their magic seems to absolutely require the sacrifice of a mage for each spell cast. One has to wonder why mages would even bother to undergo intense training for years to die for one spell which is not even that impressive. Like seriously, the guy running in the woods with smoke to \"flush out\" the mages at Sodden. What was the plan? I honestly don't know. They almost got away with it too, since no mage at Sodden thought to keep a night watch, and only Yennefer waking up in time (and not being groggy) saved them. Mages don't lend well to being suicide bombers. They are far too useful for that. You could have a mage make suicide bombers instead.\n\n***Lack of impact, and memorability***\n\nThe monster fights do not have any tension to them. The striga fight is especially guilty of this. The striga continuously ragdolls Geralt, apparently from midnight till dawn, instead of simply gutting him like it did to others. On top of that, Geralt seems unfazed by being ragdolled, and sustains no damage.\n\nThe first battle with the kikimora gets excused since it is less of a fight, and more of an intro. The other noteworthy fight with a \"monster\" in it is the dragon mountain fight, where Villentretenmerth just sits about while Geralt and Yennefer fight (a sorceress fighting with swords, for some reason). The one time he does something is when one of the reavers suffers from being able to see only what the camera shows the audience, and misses the huge golden dragon guarding the egg.\n\nThe Cintran king dies in the first episode, and I don't even care, despite Calanthe howling, because his character was not established.\n\nThere are probably many more cases, but I've already written a short novel. I've written them in the form of nitpicks, but they understate the bigger issues. Writing in the series is bad. Very bad, in fact. The effects are very bad. This show does not stand on it's own two legs. It simply panders to people who've read the books, or played the games, and banks on their nostalgia to make it a success.",

        "body": "This will probably be an unpopular opinion but it's something that pops to mind everytime something like this happens.\n\nFirst of all, let's be careful not to accuse everyone who disagreed with her casting as being racist. There are past examples of fan backlash to white actors being miscast i.e. Mark Wahlberg not looking anything like Nathan Drake, Tom Cruise being too short for Jack Reacher, Daniel Craig playing a blonde James Bond, etc.\n\nSometimes it works out ( Daniel Craig ) sometimes the backlash is so intense that the director straight up walks away ( Mark Wahlberg ).\n\nFor certain characters, I feel like they should just try to find actors that match the look as much as possible... not just for the fan's benefit but also the actor's. When you cast an actor that doesn't look like the character, you are inviting the fan backlash to come crashing down on that actor. I mean, did they think that it wouldn't happen after such a long history of other fan backlash? \n\nYes, I know that casting decisions shouldn't necessarily be swayed by potential backlash. However, you can still take steps to stay somewhat true to the source material that so many fans are obsessed with. They could have kept the same actress and at least made her hair red so she at least resembled the character.\n\nIt's been a while since I played the Witcher but I remember both Triss and Yen would visually stand out from other characters. Yen had these dark striking features and purple eyes and Triss had that fiery red hair and captivating eyes. \n\nI like Yen in the show, she definitely stands out but Triss sort of fades into the background. It's not about her being attractive or not but having a style and look the distinguishes her. She seems to just blend in. When they were on the boat, I immediately noticed Yen but it took a few moments to realize that Triss was sitting next to her.\n\nThis is a show where your key characters have certain very striking features that set them apart visually from the extras and she just doesn't have that really. I honestly think just giving her red hair would have helped in her reception. But that's just my opinion. I think the actress is great otherwise.",

        "body": "DISCLAIMER: This is my first Reddit post, ever, so I apologise in advance for any errors in formatting which I will no doubt have to amend in a later edit. I blame the pesky vagaries of a Western education that was much more focused on proper punctuation than on the arcane workings of internet boards. Also, it is worth mentioning I am not a native speaker, so grammar nazis beware.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would not, of usual, have made a post. In fact, as stated above, I quite litterally never have before. On any other day upon finishing that chapter of **Children of Blood and Bone** circa page 200 I would have simply -internally or externally- shaken my head in silent disapproval and carried on with my day (which turned out to mean, Reddit notwithstanding, buying **Nevernight** and **Grey Sister**, to replace CBB as tonight's entertainment). However, I had an argument -a friendly one, with taunts and jests, not the Thanksgiving throw-plates-at-your-sister-in-law type- with a friend of mine pre-Christmas, and between the bilge he talked and the fact that I do not have that many friends who read fantasy, I decided to turn to the internet. The internet, of course, always makes sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Children of Blood and Bone** is, in a word, not good. This post is not meant as a review of the book, so I shan't get into it much more than that, especially since I have been able to find on this august board a couple of reviews that capture my thoughts about it rather neatly -one of which is even up for one of those fancy Stabbies people seem to be so excited about. Others, of course, disagree with my opinion of the book, and in fact rather like it, which is naturally perfectly fine - as long as we're understood that when I rise to power, those sorts of people will be the first to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not surprising to find a bad book, the abound. They are, like Thanos, inevitable. It is somewhat more surprising to find a bad book that has received multiple awards and the amount of acclaim **CBB** has. One raises an eyebrow, and wonders how much something like the fantasy-Nigeria part of the premise might have spurred the excitement of the more woke-oriented members of the readership, but that is not what this post is about either. Rather, and I promise I am coming to the point now, it is about a sentence, a defence of bad writing I often find when I browse the internet in search of opinions on books I have usually already read, a defence I found today on the topic of this selfsame book, and that my friend uttered the other day with the you're-taking-this-too-seriously tone my friends sometimes get when I ramble about narrative consistency or the demographics of Harry Potter:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n« It's fantasy! »\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs inoffensive as this particular disposition of words may be, I find it stomach-churning. Although I admire and envy the brevity of it, its meaning borders on the offensive. It means something like:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n« It doesn't matter. Why are you making such a big deal out of this? »\n\n&#x200B;\n\n« This is only a second rate genre, what were you expecting? »\n\n&#x200B;\n\n« Who cares about that, it's just fantasy. »\n\n&#x200B;\n\n« You can't apply the same standards you do for *real* books - for literature. »\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd there is my Hodgmanian crux, the proverbial root of the matter. It seems to me that fans and detractors of fantasy alike too often employ standards inferior to those they otherwise would when it comes to the genre. Of the detractors, this is to be expected ; of the fans, it is altogether more perplexing. It is, in fact, entirely paradoxical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPresumably, people who spend time reading fantasy novels, and potentially talking about them with their friends or on the internet actually like the stuff. I will go so far as to say they quite enjoy those books and hold them in some level of high regard reminiscent of how Wallace looks at cheese. A subset of the fantasy readership is content with subpar writing. They might welcome good prose and careful structure, but do not consider them a necessity. Events need not make sense, character development may be sloppy, and logic is a high minded luxury. Often there is an appeal to escapism. Made up worlds need not abide by the stringent laws of sense and reason. To demand style and wordcraft out of books about wizards and dragons is pretentious and a corruption of what should be an easy read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe attentive reader will have guessed that I -rather emphatically- disagree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlashback to the discussion with my friend on the topic of **The Witcher** series of books. While he was arguing that the novels started off well but became odd and disjointed later on, I posited that there were significant weaknesses all the way back to **Blood of Elves**. One of my main gripes (this is a complaint I have about multiple series) was that the entirety of Ciri's training and study of the witchering arts happens during her stay at Kaer Morhen. By the end of something like six months, and at the ripe old age of fourteen, Ciri is so formidable a fencer that there is only a character in the entire series that gives her any trouble. To my scepticism about the verisimilitude my friend replied, you will have guessed it,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n« It's fantasy! »\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI care about verisimilitude. I realise many people are of the opinion that bending certain scientific and logical norms as the premise of fantasy opens the door to all sorts of shortcuts, but I belong to the School of Logical Within the Bounds of the Premise. I am hardly a maverick, many other people subscribe to this philosophy, but I shall restate its central tenets nonetheless:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* *The premise behind the series is the sole permitted breach of the laws of physics, human nature, and reason.*\n* *Within those bounds, all must follow the customary logic of things.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I hear people dismiss what I consider plot holes with a special dispensation they reserve for fantasy, it does not strike me so much as a difference in philosophy than as a lower standard to which they hold the genre. There is a reasonable exception to be made of literature meant for children when it comes to themes they are not old enough to deal with, or **Harry Potter** would have had to be substantially saucier. Any other time however, when I hear that « it doesn't matter » if the children are acting on the level of rationality of adults, or « why do you care » if power levels are entirely inconsistent, what I hear is « the genre we both enjoy is not worth the effort required to construct a story seriously and with care ». I resent that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also resent the notion that, for some reason, style does not matter. I will be the first to admit I love **Mistborn** and **The Stormlight Archive**, even though, by his own admission, Sanderson is by no means a master stylist - and I hear there are complaints about his dialogue. But while there are some fantastic books out there written in plain, unremarkable prose, I in no way see that as a reason not to want the best possible English out of any book I read, whatever the genre may be. There is some gorgeous prose out there that proves that, not only is it entirely feasible to write fantasy well, the genre can be an opportunity for downright groundbreaking stuff. I couldn't name two non-epistolary series written in the second person to save my life. **The Broken Earth** does not only that, but also delivers in sheer quality. Not everyone can be Jemisin, but they could try (Adonalsium knows it couldn't hurt Adeyemi).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not begrudge people who look for something different in fantasy than me. If they are happy reading something that would make me roll my eyes or look up the author's contact info so I could shout at them about their split infinitives or their violent overuse of mentions of the tugging of braids, so be it. It is only when I hear remarks about what fantasy « should » be that my hackles rise. A personal preference has nothing to do with the character of the genre as a whole, and to reduce it to whatever one's cup of tea might be is an uncalled for reduction that can only be harmful. It invites unhelpful kerfuffles about conflicting predilections and limits, for all involved, the scope of what fantasy *could* be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n« It's fantasy! » is such a reduction. It limits the possibilities of fantasy by waving away standards. It is a surrender that all but ensures we won't see great books in the future because expectations can only be shattered if they're there to begin with. It discourages those who would do better and threatens to destroy the very idea of quality, for when standards slacken or disappear we are left with no reference point to judge a book. To paraphrase ol' spiky hair, if all books are good, none of them are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suppose I should come to a conclusion at some point. What started as a post has become a protracted rant (I think the polite vernacular these days is \"essay\") and one would hope there might be a point to it all. I will therefore wrap this up with a plea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not dismiss the very thing you like by countenancing anything less than you are entitled to expect from literature. It is fantasy, but before it was fantasy it was a book, and books are meant to be good.",

        "body": "This is not a show that holds hands, and I’ve realized a lot of people not previously familiar with the books or the games are struggling to connect all the dots. Let me be your humble guide.\n\n**What the hell is a witcher?**\n\nThe world of *The Witcher* is the result of an event that took place a thousand years ago called the Conjunction of the Spheres, which deposited a bunch of different species from other dimensions into that world, including humans. Before, it was just the elves and the dwarves, who have now been pushed to the margins of their own world by the resourceful, faster-breeding human race.\n\nIn order to survive in this new and really fucked up world full of monsters from several dozen other places, the humans figured out how to use certain herbs to mutate children into, for lack of a better word, super-soldiers: witchers. The process, known as the trial of the grasses, kills 70% of the children and leaves the remainder sterile. Geralt received such a heavy dose that it turned his hair white. As you can imagine, handing over a child to the witchers, often due to poverty (this is not a society with orphanages) or as payment for a service a witcher has done a village, is deemed a fairly horrible thing to have to do, and the big-picture necessity of it doesn't help much with community relations.\n\nThe survivors develop superhuman vision (the yellow eyes) and reflexes, and a limited ability to do magic, super basic stuff like a force push, a momentary shield, a fire burst, or befuddling the mind of a target - not remotely on the same scale as sorcerers. Above all, witchers develop the ability to survive the ingestion of certain powerful potions that temporarily assist in the hunting and killing of monsters (for example, one potion used when hunting vampires turns the witcher’s blood into a toxin that will harm the vampire if the witcher is bitten).\n\nThe children are trained by senior witchers: Geralt is part of the School of the Wolf, for example, based out of the far northern fortress of Kaer Morhen. Then they're sent out into the world to wander the land as professional monster exterminators. They’re very long-lived, but the dangerous nature of their careers means they rarely die in bed.\n\nWitchering is ultimately a trade like any other (they’re not heroes - they demand payment), but it's one that sets them apart. They're needed, but also feared and hated. In part it's because their trade forces them to travel in an era of xenophobia, in part their fucked up appearance, and finally because monster problems usually develop due to some sort of moral rot within the community that no one wants to admit to - murdered lovers returning as wraiths, that sort of thing. In some cases, witchers have done their part to contribute to the problem by breaking bad, once very memorably en masse - the School of the Cat began hiring out as assassins and was ultimately destroyed.\n\nAs human society evolves out of the dark ages, witchers are also becoming less common: monsters are rarer than they used to be, and growing populations make “brute force” options like sending a couple hundred soldiers to do the job of slaying a monster more feasible - if usually far more messy, like resolving a hostage crisis with a cruise missile. As witchers become less necessary, they also become more hated.\n\n**What’s all this political stuff?**\n\nEdit: here's a map: [https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map\\_of\\_the\\_witcher\\_world/](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map_of_the_witcher_world/)\n\nThe Witcher is set in a vague analogue to eastern Europe in the middle ages. The “northern kingdoms” are a bunch of squabbling, backwards, superstitious fiefdoms and petty warlords. To their south lies the Empire of Nilfgaard, which is (ironically) a model of technological and social progress by that world's standards, except for their unfortunate desire to forcibly absorb all the northern kingdoms, which they’ve been accomplishing piecemeal for decades.\n\nIn the north, an Illuminati-style Brotherhood of Sorcerers influences everything by providing advisers to all of the rulers. In Nilfgaard, sorcerers are treated as tools and kept on a short leash by the state. In the north, elves and dwarves are hated, feared, and marginalized, very analogous to Jews or Native Americans. In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens. In the north, if you have a monster problem you hire a witcher. In Nilfgaard, you call in the national guard. You get the idea. It’s like Napoleonic France coexisting just next door to twelve flavours of Transylvania. There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way.\n\n**Great, fine. What’s the chronological plot?**\n\nThe story begins with Yennefer, a hunchbacked peasant girl with a gift for magic sold to the northern academy of wizardry, which trains her to become an advisor to kings. The use of magic turns her beautiful and extremely long-lived, but sterile - a tradeoff she happily accepts at the time, but eventually comes to resent. As a result of internal politics, Yen is ultimately sent to advise the northern kingdom of Aedirn, and a sorceress with much less backbone (Fringilla) is sent to Nilfgaard, which over the years becomes a key factor in cementing the subordinate status of wizarding types in the southern empire. Yen spends decades as the power behind the throne in Aedirn, but when the Aedirnian king assassinates his wife and nearly turns Yen into collateral damage in the process, she loses her taste for the game of thrones and decides to live life for herself.\n\nMeanwhile (give or take) Geralt, a witcher of the School of the Wolf, rolls into some town in the north named Blaviken to solve whatever local monster problems it’s got. Turns out there are no actual monsters that need defeating. There is, however, a princess named Renfri who was literally born under a bad sign. It’s unclear whether it caused her to become evil or whether everyone treating her as evil caused her to become cruel, but by the time she hits adulthood she’s vicious, vengeful, leading a band of cutthroats and hunting/being hunted by a sorcerer. Geralt is forced to kill her and her gang to prevent further carnage, but not before she prophecies that “the girl in the woods would be with him always” (being born under that sign had *some* magical effect). The resulting bloodbath, the need for which is poorly understood by the locals, earns him the moniker “the Butcher of Blaviken”, which the gruff but ultimately kindhearted Geralt hates.\n\nAt the same time, somewhere in the northern kingdom of Cintra, a teenaged Queen Calanthe has just won her first battle. It’s the start of an Elizabethan reign.\n\nGeralt carries on his life as an itinerant exterminator, stopping along the way to rid the northern kingdom of Temeria from a cursed monster caused by royal incest between King Foltest and his sister, and eventually connects with Jaskier, a travelling bard. They take a shine to each other and begin travelling together. In addition to their friendship, there’s a practical aspect to their partnership: Geralt provides an endless source of material for Jaskier’s songs, and Jaskier acts as a one-man PR department for Geralt, giving him the moniker “the White Wolf” to compete with “the Butcher of Blaviken” and generally making it easier for Geralt to find work, demand higher rates and get paid without incident.\n\nMeanwhile in Cintra, Queen Calanthe has grown from teenage military prodigy into dominant warrior queen. After her first husband Roegner died in a plague and despite having feelings for Eist, a prince of Skellige (an island chain of Celtic/Norse reavers off the coast), she remains unmarried so that she can remain squarely in charge.\n\nGeralt and Jaskier attend a feast to determine a husband for Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta. It comes out that Duny, a knight cursed to look like a hedgehog, had once saved Roegner’s life and invoked the Law of Surprise as a reward (to give Duny that which Roegner had but did not know). Since Calanthe was pregnant, the reward was Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta, and now Duny is at the wedding feast to claim Pavetta’s hand in marriage. After several attempted stabbings, Pavetta happily accepts, and Calanthe also decides to marry Eist. Duny (no longer a hedgehog) tries to reward Geralt, who invokes the Law of Surprise himself, and surprise…Pavetta’s already pregnant with Ciri, giving Geralt a claim to the child to raise as his own. This is a political disaster and nobody is less pleased than Geralt, who tries to solve the problem by laying no claim to the child and immediately leaving Cintra. Calanthe attempts to make doubly sure of the issue by sending men to kill him, but they fail.\n\nDespite his attempt to nip the problem in the bud, Geralt remains troubled. He doesn’t want to admit it, but the Law of Surprise has some magic to it, and by leaving Ciri in someone else’s hands he’s fighting against the current of fate. He does the healthy thing and attempts to resolve his unease by fishing a djinni in a bottle out of a lake to wish for a good night’s sleep. Shenanigans ensue, and Geralt and Jaskier travel to the nearest town to seek assistance saving Jaskier’s life. This is where they first meet Yen, who runs the place and is evidently happier ruling in hell than serving in heaven, so to speak. Yen tries to take advantage of the situation by capturing the djinn to become all-powerful, but the djinn nearly kills her. Geralt saves Yen by using his last wish to ask for their fates to be bound together (and since the djinn can't hurt its master, saving Yen's life).\n\nIt’s such a powerful wish that it’s not clear whether the djinn was in fact capable of granting it, but if it did, it explains why over the ensuing years, Geralt and Yen keep running into each other, which next occurs on a dragon hunt that Yen is undertaking in an attempt to regain her lost fertility. During that hunt, Yen needles Geralt about his hypocrisy for lecturing her about accepting what can’t be changed while all this time neglecting the child that fate had bestowed on him. It’s the last straw, and Geralt nuts up and returns to Cintra to check in on Ciri and ensure her well-being.\n\nIn the intervening years, Ciri’s parents (Duny and Pavetta) have died in a shipwreck and Calanthe and Eist are raising Ciri, who is now heir to the Cintran throne. Geralt gets an extremely frosty reception. Rumours of war with Nilfgaard (now ruled by an exceptionally capable, ambitious emperor) are circulating in Cintra, but they don’t make sense to Calanthe, who doesn’t think taking Cintra is a wise decision for Nilfgaard from a strategic perspective (Nilfgaard's apparently irrational desire to conquer Cintra is a plot point that won’t pay off until Season 2). Geralt offers to take Ciri away for a time to protect her from the prospect of impending war, but Calanthe rejects the idea, and Geralt is tossed in prison when he refuses to disown Ciri.\n\nAt this juncture, Nilfgaard launches a snap invasion, shocking Calanthe, successfully defeating the Cintran army, killing Eist, and sacking Cintra. Calanthe urges Ciri to seek out Geralt’s protection, and then commits suicide to avoid the indignity of capture. This is the point in the story when the chronology starts to unite and events begin to move quickly.\n\nCiri escapes the capital with Nilfgaardian hunters hot on her heels, first taking refuge with the dryads in the forest of Brokilon before eventually trying to make her way to her step-grandfather Eist’s family in Skellige. Along the way, a farmer’s wife takes her home to keep her safe, and tries to convince her to stay.\n\nAs the Nilfgaardian army marches north from Cintra toward the rest of the northern kingdoms, Yen and the other wizard Illuminati move to intercept them at Sodden Hill, a defensible chokepoint about a day away from the farmstead where Ciri is staying.\n\nGeralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.\n\nCiri has a vision of Geralt at Sodden Hill calling out Yen's name, and leaves the farm, cutting through the woods toward Sodden Hill to do as Calanthe urged and connect with Geralt.\n\nWhen Geralt reaches the farm, he realizes that by a cosmic stroke of fate, the wife of the farmer who saved him had found Ciri, who unknown to the farmer’s wife had left just before Geralt's arrival. Geralt recognizes the circumstance from the prophecy made to him by the dying Renfri decades earlier, and hares it into the woods to find the daughter destiny always meant for him to have. They finally meet, and Ciri asks him who the woman is that Geralt was calling out for in her vision (Yennefer), setting up the two of them to travel to the Sodden Hill battlefield in Season 2 to look for Yen, and possibly solve the mystery of why Nilfgaard was so hellbent on conquering Cintra.",

To their south lies the Empire of Nilfgaard, which is (ironically) a model of technological and social progress by that world's standards, except for their unfortunate desire to forcibly absorb all the northern kingdoms, which they’ve been accomplishing piecemeal for decades.\n\nIn the north, an Illuminati-style Brotherhood of Sorcerers influences everything by providing advisers to all of the rulers. In Nilfgaard, sorcerers are treated as tools and kept on a short leash by the state. In the north, elves and dwarves are hated, feared, and marginalized, very analogous to Jews or Native Americans. In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens. In the north, if you have a monster problem you hire a witcher. In Nilfgaard, you call in the national guard. You get the idea. It’s like Napoleonic France coexisting just next door to twelve flavours of Transylvania. There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way.\n\n**Great, fine. What’s the chronological plot?**\n\nThe story begins with Yennefer, a hunchbacked peasant girl with a gift for magic sold to the northern academy of wizardry, which trains her to become an advisor to kings. The use of magic turns her beautiful and extremely long-lived, but sterile - a tradeoff she happily accepts at the time, but eventually comes to resent. As a result of internal politics, Yen is ultimately sent to advise the northern kingdom of Aedirn, and a sorceress with much less backbone (Fringilla) is sent to Nilfgaard, which over the years becomes a key factor in cementing the subordinate status of wizarding types in the southern empire. Yen spends decades as the power behind the throne in Aedirn, but when the Aedirnian king assassinates his wife and nearly turns Yen into collateral damage in the process, she loses her taste for the game of thrones and decides to live life for herself.\n\nMeanwhile (give or take) Geralt, a witcher of the School of the Wolf, rolls into some town in the north named Blaviken to solve whatever local monster problems it’s got. Turns out there are no actual monsters that need defeating. There is, however, a princess named Renfri who was literally born under a bad sign. It’s unclear whether it caused her to become evil or whether everyone treating her as evil caused her to become cruel, but by the time she hits adulthood she’s vicious, vengeful, leading a band of cutthroats and hunting/being hunted by a sorcerer. Geralt is forced to kill her and her gang to prevent further carnage, but not before she prophecies that “the girl in the woods would be with him always” (being born under that sign had *some* magical effect). The resulting bloodbath, the need for which is poorly understood by the locals, earns him the moniker “the Butcher of Blaviken”, which the gruff but ultimately kindhearted Geralt hates.\n\nAt the same time, somewhere in the northern kingdom of Cintra, a teenaged Queen Calanthe has just won her first battle. It’s the start of an Elizabethan reign.\n\nGeralt carries on his life as an itinerant exterminator, stopping along the way to rid the northern kingdom of Temeria from a cursed monster caused by royal incest between King Foltest and his sister, and eventually connects with Jaskier, a travelling bard. They take a shine to each other and begin travelling together. In addition to their friendship, there’s a practical aspect to their partnership: Geralt provides an endless source of material for Jaskier’s songs, and Jaskier acts as a one-man PR department for Geralt, giving him the moniker “the White Wolf” to compete with “the Butcher of Blaviken” and generally making it easier for Geralt to find work, demand higher rates and get paid without incident.\n\nMeanwhile in Cintra, Queen Calanthe has grown from teenage military prodigy into dominant warrior queen. After her first husband Roegner died in a plague and despite having feelings for Eist, a prince of Skellige (an island chain of Celtic/Norse reavers off the coast), she remains unmarried so that she can remain squarely in charge.\n\nGeralt and Jaskier attend a feast to determine a husband for Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta. It comes out that Duny, a knight cursed to look like a hedgehog, had once saved Roegner’s life and invoked the Law of Surprise as a reward (to give Duny that which Roegner had but did not know). Since Calanthe was pregnant, the reward was Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta, and now Duny is at the wedding feast to claim Pavetta’s hand in marriage. After several attempted stabbings, Pavetta happily accepts, and Calanthe also decides to marry Eist. Duny (no longer a hedgehog) tries to reward Geralt, who invokes the Law of Surprise himself, and surprise…Pavetta’s already pregnant with Ciri, giving Geralt a claim to the child to raise as his own. This is a political disaster and nobody is less pleased than Geralt, who tries to solve the problem by laying no claim to the child and immediately leaving Cintra. Calanthe attempts to make doubly sure of the issue by sending men to kill him, but they fail.\n\nDespite his attempt to nip the problem in the bud, Geralt remains troubled. He doesn’t want to admit it, but the Law of Surprise has some magic to it, and by leaving Ciri in someone else’s hands he’s fighting against the current of fate. He does the healthy thing and attempts to resolve his unease by fishing a djinni in a bottle out of a lake to wish for a good night’s sleep. Shenanigans ensue, and Geralt and Jaskier travel to the nearest town to seek assistance saving Jaskier’s life. This is where they first meet Yen, who runs the place and is evidently happier ruling in hell than serving in heaven, so to speak. Yen tries to take advantage of the situation by capturing the djinn to become all-powerful, but the djinn nearly kills her. Geralt saves Yen by using his last wish to ask for their fates to be bound together (and since the djinn can't hurt its master, saving Yen's life).\n\nIt’s such a powerful wish that it’s not clear whether the djinn was in fact capable of granting it, but if it did, it explains why over the ensuing years, Geralt and Yen keep running into each other, which next occurs on a dragon hunt that Yen is undertaking in an attempt to regain her lost fertility. During that hunt, Yen needles Geralt about his hypocrisy for lecturing her about accepting what can’t be changed while all this time neglecting the child that fate had bestowed on him. It’s the last straw, and Geralt nuts up and returns to Cintra to check in on Ciri and ensure her well-being.\n\nIn the intervening years, Ciri’s parents (Duny and Pavetta) have died in a shipwreck and Calanthe and Eist are raising Ciri, who is now heir to the Cintran throne. Geralt gets an extremely frosty reception. Rumours of war with Nilfgaard (now ruled by an exceptionally capable, ambitious emperor) are circulating in Cintra, but they don’t make sense to Calanthe, who doesn’t think taking Cintra is a wise decision for Nilfgaard from a strategic perspective (Nilfgaard's apparently irrational desire to conquer Cintra is a plot point that won’t pay off until Season 2). Geralt offers to take Ciri away for a time to protect her from the prospect of impending war, but Calanthe rejects the idea, and Geralt is tossed in prison when he refuses to disown Ciri.\n\nAt this juncture, Nilfgaard launches a snap invasion, shocking Calanthe, successfully defeating the Cintran army, killing Eist, and sacking Cintra. Calanthe urges Ciri to seek out Geralt’s protection, and then commits suicide to avoid the indignity of capture. This is the point in the story when the chronology starts to unite and events begin to move quickly.\n\nCiri escapes the capital with Nilfgaardian hunters hot on her heels, first taking refuge with the dryads in the forest of Brokilon before eventually trying to make her way to her step-grandfather Eist’s family in Skellige. Along the way, a farmer’s wife takes her home to keep her safe, and tries to convince her to stay.\n\nAs the Nilfgaardian army marches north from Cintra toward the rest of the northern kingdoms, Yen and the other wizard Illuminati move to intercept them at Sodden Hill, a defensible chokepoint about a day away from the farmstead where Ciri is staying.\n\nGeralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.\n\nCiri has a vision of Geralt at Sodden Hill calling out Yen's name, and leaves the farm, cutting through the woods toward Sodden Hill to do as Calanthe urged and connect with Geralt.\n\nWhen Geralt reaches the farm, he realizes that by a cosmic stroke of fate, the wife of the farmer who saved him had found Ciri, who unknown to the farmer’s wife had left just before Geralt's arrival. Geralt recognizes the circumstance from the prophecy made to him by the dying Renfri decades earlier, and hares it into the woods to find the daughter destiny always meant for him to have. They finally meet, and Ciri asks him who the woman is that Geralt was calling out for in her vision (Yennefer), setting up the two of them to travel to the Sodden Hill battlefield in Season 2 to look for Yen, and possibly solve the mystery of why Nilfgaard was so hellbent on conquering Cintra.",

Before, it was just the elves and the dwarves, who have now been pushed to the margins of their own world by the resourceful, faster-breeding human race.\n\nIn order to survive in this new and really fucked up world full of monsters from several dozen other places, the humans figured out how to use certain herbs to mutate children into, for lack of a better word, super-soldiers: witchers.

As you can imagine, handing over a child to the witchers, often due to poverty (this is not a society with orphanages) or as payment for a service a witcher has done a village, is deemed a fairly horrible thing to have to do, and the big-picture necessity of it doesn't help much with community relations.\n\nThe survivors develop superhuman vision (the yellow eyes) and reflexes, and a limited ability to do magic, super basic stuff like a force push, a momentary shield, a fire burst, or befuddling the mind of a target - not remotely on the same scale as sorcerers.

In some cases, witchers have done their part to contribute to the problem by breaking bad, once very memorably en masse - the School of the Cat began hiring out as assassins and was ultimately destroyed.\n\nAs human society evolves out of the dark ages, witchers are also becoming less common: monsters are rarer than they used to be, and growing populations make “brute force” options like sending a couple hundred soldiers to do the job of slaying a monster more feasible - if usually far more messy, like resolving a hostage crisis with a cruise missile.

Geralt is forced to kill her and her gang to prevent further carnage, but not before she prophecies that “the girl in the woods would be with him always” (being born under that sign had *some* magical effect). The resulting bloodbath, the need for which is poorly understood by the locals, earns him the moniker “the Butcher of Blaviken”, which the gruff but ultimately kindhearted Geralt hates.\n\nAt the same time, somewhere in the northern kingdom of Cintra, a teenaged Queen Calanthe has just won her first battle. It’s the start of an Elizabethan reign.\n\nGeralt carries on his life as an itinerant exterminator, stopping along the way to rid the northern kingdom of Temeria from a cursed monster caused by royal incest between King Foltest and his sister, and eventually connects with Jaskier, a travelling bard. They take a shine to each other and begin travelling together. In addition to their friendship, there’s a practical aspect to their partnership: Geralt provides an endless source of material for Jaskier’s songs, and Jaskier acts as a one-man PR department for Geralt, giving him the moniker “the White Wolf” to compete with “the Butcher of Blaviken” and generally making it easier for Geralt to find work, demand higher rates and get paid without incident.\n\nMeanwhile in Cintra, Queen Calanthe has grown from teenage military prodigy into dominant warrior queen. After her first husband Roegner died in a plague and despite having feelings for Eist, a prince of Skellige (an island chain of Celtic/Norse reavers off the coast), she remains unmarried so that she can remain squarely in charge.\n\nGeralt and Jaskier attend a feast to determine a husband for Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta. It comes out that Duny, a knight cursed to look like a hedgehog, had once saved Roegner’s life and invoked the Law of Surprise as a reward (to give Duny that which Roegner had but did not know). Since Calanthe was pregnant, the reward was Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta, and now Duny is at the wedding feast to claim Pavetta’s hand in marriage. After several attempted stabbings, Pavetta happily accepts, and Calanthe also decides to marry Eist. Duny (no longer a hedgehog) tries to reward Geralt, who invokes the Law of Surprise himself, and surprise…Pavetta’s already pregnant with Ciri, giving Geralt a claim to the child to raise as his own. This is a political disaster and nobody is less pleased than Geralt, who tries to solve the problem by laying no claim to the child and immediately leaving Cintra. Calanthe attempts to make doubly sure of the issue by sending men to kill him, but they fail.\n\nDespite his attempt to nip the problem in the bud, Geralt remains troubled. He doesn’t want to admit it, but the Law of Surprise has some magic to it, and by leaving Ciri in someone else’s hands he’s fighting against the current of fate. He does the healthy thing and attempts to resolve his unease by fishing a djinni in a bottle out of a lake to wish for a good night’s sleep. Shenanigans ensue, and Geralt and Jaskier travel to the nearest town to seek assistance saving Jaskier’s life. This is where they first meet Yen, who runs the place and is evidently happier ruling in hell than serving in heaven, so to speak. Yen tries to take advantage of the situation by capturing the djinn to become all-powerful, but the djinn nearly kills her. Geralt saves Yen by using his last wish to ask for their fates to be bound together (and since the djinn can't hurt its master, saving Yen's life).\n\nIt’s such a powerful wish that it’s not clear whether the djinn was in fact capable of granting it, but if it did, it explains why over the ensuing years, Geralt and Yen keep running into each other, which next occurs on a dragon hunt that Yen is undertaking in an attempt to regain her lost fertility. During that hunt, Yen needles Geralt about his hypocrisy for lecturing her about accepting what can’t be changed while all this time neglecting the child that fate had bestowed on him. It’s the last straw, and Geralt nuts up and returns to Cintra to check in on Ciri and ensure her well-being.\n\nIn the intervening years, Ciri’s parents (Duny and Pavetta) have died in a shipwreck and Calanthe and Eist are raising Ciri, who is now heir to the Cintran throne. Geralt gets an extremely frosty reception. Rumours of war with Nilfgaard (now ruled by an exceptionally capable, ambitious emperor) are circulating in Cintra, but they don’t make sense to Calanthe, who doesn’t think taking Cintra is a wise decision for Nilfgaard from a strategic perspective (Nilfgaard's apparently irrational desire to conquer Cintra is a plot point that won’t pay off until Season 2). Geralt offers to take Ciri away for a time to protect her from the prospect of impending war, but Calanthe rejects the idea, and Geralt is tossed in prison when he refuses to disown Ciri.\n\nAt this juncture, Nilfgaard launches a snap invasion, shocking Calanthe, successfully defeating the Cintran army, killing Eist, and sacking Cintra. Calanthe urges Ciri to seek out Geralt’s protection, and then commits suicide to avoid the indignity of capture. This is the point in the story when the chronology starts to unite and events begin to move quickly.\n\nCiri escapes the capital with Nilfgaardian hunters hot on her heels, first taking refuge with the dryads in the forest of Brokilon before eventually trying to make her way to her step-grandfather Eist’s family in Skellige. Along the way, a farmer’s wife takes her home to keep her safe, and tries to convince her to stay.\n\nAs the Nilfgaardian army marches north from Cintra toward the rest of the northern kingdoms, Yen and the other wizard Illuminati move to intercept them at Sodden Hill, a defensible chokepoint about a day away from the farmstead where Ciri is staying.\n\nGeralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.\n\nCiri has a vision of Geralt at Sodden Hill calling out Yen's name, and leaves the farm, cutting through the woods toward Sodden Hill to do as Calanthe urged and connect with Geralt.\n\nWhen Geralt reaches the farm, he realizes that by a cosmic stroke of fate, the wife of the farmer who saved him had found Ciri, who unknown to the farmer’s wife had left just before Geralt's arrival. Geralt recognizes the circumstance from the prophecy made to him by the dying Renfri decades earlier, and hares it into the woods to find the daughter destiny always meant for him to have. They finally meet, and Ciri asks him who the woman is that Geralt was calling out for in her vision (Yennefer), setting up the two of them to travel to the Sodden Hill battlefield in Season 2 to look for Yen, and possibly solve the mystery of why Nilfgaard was so hellbent on conquering Cintra.",

        "body": "This is not a show that holds hands, and I’ve realized a lot of people not previously familiar with the books or the games are struggling to connect all the dots. Let me be your humble guide.\n\n**What the hell is a witcher?**\n\nThe world of *The Witcher* is the result of an event that took place a thousand years ago called the Conjunction of the Spheres, which deposited a bunch of different species from other dimensions into that world, including humans. Before, it was just the elves and the dwarves, who have now been pushed to the margins of their own world by the resourceful, faster-breeding human race.\n\nIn order to survive in this new and really fucked up world full of monsters from several dozen other places, the humans figured out how to use certain herbs to mutate children into, for lack of a better word, super-soldiers: witchers. The process, known as the trial of the grasses, kills 70% of the children and leaves the remainder sterile. Geralt received such a heavy dose that it turned his hair white. As you can imagine, handing over a child to the witchers, often due to poverty (this is not a society with orphanages) or as payment for a service a witcher has done a village, is deemed a fairly horrible thing to have to do, and the big-picture necessity of it doesn't help much with community relations.\n\nThe survivors develop superhuman vision (the yellow eyes) and reflexes, and a limited ability to do magic, super basic stuff like a force push, a momentary shield, a fire burst, or befuddling the mind of a target - not remotely on the same scale as sorcerers. Above all, witchers develop the ability to survive the ingestion of certain powerful potions that temporarily assist in the hunting and killing of monsters (for example, one potion used when hunting vampires turns the witcher’s blood into a toxin that will harm the vampire if the witcher is bitten).\n\nThe children are trained by senior witchers: Geralt is part of the School of the Wolf, for example, based out of the far northern fortress of Kaer Morhen. Then they're sent out into the world to wander the land as professional monster exterminators. They’re very long-lived, but the dangerous nature of their careers means they rarely die in bed.\n\nWitchering is ultimately a trade like any other (they’re not heroes - they demand payment), but it's one that sets them apart. They're needed, but also feared and hated. In part it's because their trade forces them to travel in an era of xenophobia, in part their fucked up appearance, and finally because monster problems usually develop due to some sort of moral rot within the community that no one wants to admit to - murdered lovers returning as wraiths, that sort of thing. In some cases, witchers have done their part to contribute to the problem by breaking bad, once very memorably en masse - the School of the Cat began hiring out as assassins and was ultimately destroyed.\n\nAs human society evolves out of the dark ages, witchers are also becoming less common: monsters are rarer than they used to be, and growing populations make “brute force” options like sending a couple hundred soldiers to do the job of slaying a monster more feasible - if usually far more messy, like resolving a hostage crisis with a cruise missile. As witchers become less necessary, they also become more hated.\n\n**What’s all this political stuff?**\n\nEdit: here's a map: [https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map\\_of\\_the\\_witcher\\_world/](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map_of_the_witcher_world/)\n\nThe Witcher is set in a vague analogue to eastern Europe in the middle ages. The “northern kingdoms” are a bunch of squabbling, backwards, superstitious fiefdoms and petty warlords. To their south lies the Empire of Nilfgaard, which is (ironically) a model of technological and social progress by that world's standards, except for their unfortunate desire to forcibly absorb all the northern kingdoms, which they’ve been accomplishing piecemeal for decades.\n\nIn the north, an Illuminati-style Brotherhood of Sorcerers influences everything by providing advisers to all of the rulers. In Nilfgaard, sorcerers are treated as tools and kept on a short leash by the state. In the north, elves and dwarves are hated, feared, and marginalized, very analogous to Jews or Native Americans. In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens. In the north, if you have a monster problem you hire a witcher. In Nilfgaard, you call in the national guard. You get the idea. It’s like Napoleonic France coexisting just next door to twelve flavours of Transylvania. There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way.\n\n**Great, fine. What’s the chronological plot?**\n\nThe story begins with Yennefer, a hunchbacked peasant girl with a gift for magic sold to the northern academy of wizardry, which trains her to become an advisor to kings. The use of magic turns her beautiful and extremely long-lived, but sterile - a tradeoff she happily accepts at the time, but eventually comes to resent. As a result of internal politics, Yen is ultimately sent to advise the northern kingdom of Aedirn, and a sorceress with much less backbone (Fringilla) is sent to Nilfgaard, which over the years becomes a key factor in cementing the subordinate status of wizarding types in the southern empire. Yen spends decades as the power behind the throne in Aedirn, but when the Aedirnian king assassinates his wife and nearly turns Yen into collateral damage in the process, she loses her taste for the game of thrones and decides to live life for herself.\n\nMeanwhile (give or take) Geralt, a witcher of the School of the Wolf, rolls into some town in the north named Blaviken to solve whatever local monster problems it’s got. Turns out there are no actual monsters that need defeating. There is, however, a princess named Renfri who was literally born under a bad sign. It’s unclear whether it caused her to become evil or whether everyone treating her as evil caused her to become cruel, but by the time she hits adulthood she’s vicious, vengeful, leading a band of cutthroats and hunting/being hunted by a sorcerer.

He doesn’t want to admit it, but the Law of Surprise has some magic to it, and by leaving Ciri in someone else’s hands he’s fighting against the current of fate. He does the healthy thing and attempts to resolve his unease by fishing a djinni in a bottle out of a lake to wish for a good night’s sleep. Shenanigans ensue, and Geralt and Jaskier travel to the nearest town to seek assistance saving Jaskier’s life. This is where they first meet Yen, who runs the place and is evidently happier ruling in hell than serving in heaven, so to speak. Yen tries to take advantage of the situation by capturing the djinn to become all-powerful, but the djinn nearly kills her. Geralt saves Yen by using his last wish to ask for their fates to be bound together (and since the djinn can't hurt its master, saving Yen's life).\n\nIt’s such a powerful wish that it’s not clear whether the djinn was in fact capable of granting it, but if it did, it explains why over the ensuing years, Geralt and Yen keep running into each other, which next occurs on a dragon hunt that Yen is undertaking in an attempt to regain her lost fertility. During that hunt, Yen needles Geralt about his hypocrisy for lecturing her about accepting what can’t be changed while all this time neglecting the child that fate had bestowed on him. It’s the last straw, and Geralt nuts up and returns to Cintra to check in on Ciri and ensure her well-being.\n\nIn the intervening years, Ciri’s parents (Duny and Pavetta) have died in a shipwreck and Calanthe and Eist are raising Ciri, who is now heir to the Cintran throne. Geralt gets an extremely frosty reception. Rumours of war with Nilfgaard (now ruled by an exceptionally capable, ambitious emperor) are circulating in Cintra, but they don’t make sense to Calanthe, who doesn’t think taking Cintra is a wise decision for Nilfgaard from a strategic perspective (Nilfgaard's apparently irrational desire to conquer Cintra is a plot point that won’t pay off until Season 2). Geralt offers to take Ciri away for a time to protect her from the prospect of impending war, but Calanthe rejects the idea, and Geralt is tossed in prison when he refuses to disown Ciri.\n\nAt this juncture, Nilfgaard launches a snap invasion, shocking Calanthe, successfully defeating the Cintran army, killing Eist, and sacking Cintra. Calanthe urges Ciri to seek out Geralt’s protection, and then commits suicide to avoid the indignity of capture. This is the point in the story when the chronology starts to unite and events begin to move quickly.\n\nCiri escapes the capital with Nilfgaardian hunters hot on her heels, first taking refuge with the dryads in the forest of Brokilon before eventually trying to make her way to her step-grandfather Eist’s family in Skellige. Along the way, a farmer’s wife takes her home to keep her safe, and tries to convince her to stay.\n\nAs the Nilfgaardian army marches north from Cintra toward the rest of the northern kingdoms, Yen and the other wizard Illuminati move to intercept them at Sodden Hill, a defensible chokepoint about a day away from the farmstead where Ciri is staying.\n\nGeralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.\n\nCiri has a vision of Geralt at Sodden Hill calling out Yen's name, and leaves the farm, cutting through the woods toward Sodden Hill to do as Calanthe urged and connect with Geralt.\n\nWhen Geralt reaches the farm, he realizes that by a cosmic stroke of fate, the wife of the farmer who saved him had found Ciri, who unknown to the farmer’s wife had left just before Geralt's arrival. Geralt recognizes the circumstance from the prophecy made to him by the dying Renfri decades earlier, and hares it into the woods to find the daughter destiny always meant for him to have. They finally meet, and Ciri asks him who the woman is that Geralt was calling out for in her vision (Yennefer), setting up the two of them to travel to the Sodden Hill battlefield in Season 2 to look for Yen, and possibly solve the mystery of why Nilfgaard was so hellbent on conquering Cintra.",

        "body": "This is not a show that holds hands, and I’ve realized a lot of people not previously familiar with the books or the games are struggling to connect all the dots. Let me be your humble guide.\n\n**What the hell is a witcher?**\n\nThe world of *The Witcher* is the result of an event that took place a thousand years ago called the Conjunction of the Spheres, which deposited a bunch of different species from other dimensions into that world, including humans. Before, it was just the elves and the dwarves, who have now been pushed to the margins of their own world by the resourceful, faster-breeding human race.\n\nIn order to survive in this new and really fucked up world full of monsters from several dozen other places, the humans figured out how to use certain herbs to mutate children into, for lack of a better word, super-soldiers: witchers. The process, known as the trial of the grasses, kills 70% of the children and leaves the remainder sterile. Geralt received such a heavy dose that it turned his hair white. As you can imagine, handing over a child to the witchers, often due to poverty (this is not a society with orphanages) or as payment for a service a witcher has done a village, is deemed a fairly horrible thing to have to do, and the big-picture necessity of it doesn't help much with community relations.\n\nThe survivors develop superhuman vision (the yellow eyes) and reflexes, and a limited ability to do magic, super basic stuff like a force push, a momentary shield, a fire burst, or befuddling the mind of a target - not remotely on the same scale as sorcerers. Above all, witchers develop the ability to survive the ingestion of certain powerful potions that temporarily assist in the hunting and killing of monsters (for example, one potion used when hunting vampires turns the witcher’s blood into a toxin that will harm the vampire if the witcher is bitten).\n\nThe children are trained by senior witchers: Geralt is part of the School of the Wolf, for example, based out of the far northern fortress of Kaer Morhen. Then they're sent out into the world to wander the land as professional monster exterminators. They’re very long-lived, but the dangerous nature of their careers means they rarely die in bed.\n\nWitchering is ultimately a trade like any other (they’re not heroes - they demand payment), but it's one that sets them apart. They're needed, but also feared and hated. In part it's because their trade forces them to travel in an era of xenophobia, in part their fucked up appearance, and finally because monster problems usually develop due to some sort of moral rot within the community that no one wants to admit to - murdered lovers returning as wraiths, that sort of thing. In some cases, witchers have done their part to contribute to the problem by breaking bad, once very memorably en masse - the School of the Cat began hiring out as assassins and was ultimately destroyed.\n\nAs human society evolves out of the dark ages, witchers are also becoming less common: monsters are rarer than they used to be, and growing populations make “brute force” options like sending a couple hundred soldiers to do the job of slaying a monster more feasible - if usually far more messy, like resolving a hostage crisis with a cruise missile. As witchers become less necessary, they also become more hated.\n\n**What’s all this political stuff?**\n\nEdit: here's a map: [https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map\\_of\\_the\\_witcher\\_world/](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map_of_the_witcher_world/)\n\nThe Witcher is set in a vague analogue to eastern Europe in the middle ages. The “northern kingdoms” are a bunch of squabbling, backwards, superstitious fiefdoms and petty warlords. To their south lies the Empire of Nilfgaard, which is (ironically) a model of technological and social progress by that world's standards, except for their unfortunate desire to forcibly absorb all the northern kingdoms, which they’ve been accomplishing piecemeal for decades.\n\nIn the north, an Illuminati-style Brotherhood of Sorcerers influences everything by providing advisers to all of the rulers. In Nilfgaard, sorcerers are treated as tools and kept on a short leash by the state. In the north, elves and dwarves are hated, feared, and marginalized, very analogous to Jews or Native Americans. In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens. In the north, if you have a monster problem you hire a witcher. In Nilfgaard, you call in the national guard. You get the idea. It’s like Napoleonic France coexisting just next door to twelve flavours of Transylvania. There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way.\n\n**Great, fine. What’s the chronological plot?**\n\nThe story begins with Yennefer, a hunchbacked peasant girl with a gift for magic sold to the northern academy of wizardry, which trains her to become an advisor to kings. The use of magic turns her beautiful and extremely long-lived, but sterile - a tradeoff she happily accepts at the time, but eventually comes to resent. As a result of internal politics, Yen is ultimately sent to advise the northern kingdom of Aedirn, and a sorceress with much less backbone (Fringilla) is sent to Nilfgaard, which over the years becomes a key factor in cementing the subordinate status of wizarding types in the southern empire. Yen spends decades as the power behind the throne in Aedirn, but when the Aedirnian king assassinates his wife and nearly turns Yen into collateral damage in the process, she loses her taste for the game of thrones and decides to live life for herself.\n\nMeanwhile (give or take) Geralt, a witcher of the School of the Wolf, rolls into some town in the north named Blaviken to solve whatever local monster problems it’s got. Turns out there are no actual monsters that need defeating. There is, however, a princess named Renfri who was literally born under a bad sign. It’s unclear whether it caused her to become evil or whether everyone treating her as evil caused her to become cruel, but by the time she hits adulthood she’s vicious, vengeful, leading a band of cutthroats and hunting/being hunted by a sorcerer. Geralt is forced to kill her and her gang to prevent further carnage, but not before she prophecies that “the girl in the woods would be with him always” (being born under that sign had *some* magical effect). The resulting bloodbath, the need for which is poorly understood by the locals, earns him the moniker “the Butcher of Blaviken”, which the gruff but ultimately kindhearted Geralt hates.\n\nAt the same time, somewhere in the northern kingdom of Cintra, a teenaged Queen Calanthe has just won her first battle. It’s the start of an Elizabethan reign.\n\nGeralt carries on his life as an itinerant exterminator, stopping along the way to rid the northern kingdom of Temeria from a cursed monster caused by royal incest between King Foltest and his sister, and eventually connects with Jaskier, a travelling bard. They take a shine to each other and begin travelling together. In addition to their friendship, there’s a practical aspect to their partnership: Geralt provides an endless source of material for Jaskier’s songs, and Jaskier acts as a one-man PR department for Geralt, giving him the moniker “the White Wolf” to compete with “the Butcher of Blaviken” and generally making it easier for Geralt to find work, demand higher rates and get paid without incident.\n\nMeanwhile in Cintra, Queen Calanthe has grown from teenage military prodigy into dominant warrior queen. After her first husband Roegner died in a plague and despite having feelings for Eist, a prince of Skellige (an island chain of Celtic/Norse reavers off the coast), she remains unmarried so that she can remain squarely in charge.\n\nGeralt and Jaskier attend a feast to determine a husband for Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta. It comes out that Duny, a knight cursed to look like a hedgehog, had once saved Roegner’s life and invoked the Law of Surprise as a reward (to give Duny that which Roegner had but did not know). Since Calanthe was pregnant, the reward was Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta, and now Duny is at the wedding feast to claim Pavetta’s hand in marriage. After several attempted stabbings, Pavetta happily accepts, and Calanthe also decides to marry Eist. Duny (no longer a hedgehog) tries to reward Geralt, who invokes the Law of Surprise himself, and surprise…Pavetta’s already pregnant with Ciri, giving Geralt a claim to the child to raise as his own. This is a political disaster and nobody is less pleased than Geralt, who tries to solve the problem by laying no claim to the child and immediately leaving Cintra.

Along the way, a farmer’s wife takes her home to keep her safe, and tries to convince her to stay.\n\nAs the Nilfgaardian army marches north from Cintra toward the rest of the northern kingdoms, Yen and the other wizard Illuminati move to intercept them at Sodden Hill, a defensible chokepoint about a day away from the farmstead where Ciri is staying.\n\nGeralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.\n\nCiri has a vision of Geralt at Sodden Hill calling out Yen's name, and leaves the farm, cutting through the woods toward Sodden Hill to do as Calanthe urged and connect with Geralt.\n\nWhen Geralt reaches the farm, he realizes that by a cosmic stroke of fate, the wife of the farmer who saved him had found Ciri, who unknown to the farmer’s wife had left just before Geralt's arrival. Geralt recognizes the circumstance from the prophecy made to him by the dying Renfri decades earlier, and hares it into the woods to find the daughter destiny always meant for him to have. They finally meet, and Ciri asks him who the woman is that Geralt was calling out for in her vision (Yennefer), setting up the two of them to travel to the Sodden Hill battlefield in Season 2 to look for Yen, and possibly solve the mystery of why Nilfgaard was so hellbent on conquering Cintra.",

        "body": "First of all, I am a big fan of books and games, who read through all of the books 3 times and played all 3 main games. And that's why many things in the Netflix series...kind of feel offensive. And I am not talking about the overall quality of the show - it's...well, serviceable. I kind of enjoyed the series and I am glad that witcher became so mainstream. But... \n\nMagic in this show is concerning. In the books, mages are force to be reckoned with - a trained sorcerer can take on a small army and emerge victorious. But in the show mages suck. Summoning swords? Wines? Firing bow?! What?! \nSome may say \"But maybe they are not trained and that's why they can do nothing\", and to that I say \" Nope\". In the books, during the battle of Sodden Vilgefortz was already a renowned mage with years of training behind his back. He was POWERFUL - maybe even the most powerful mage in the world. And what do we see here? He summons a sword. Uses it poorly. Summons another one. Looses it. Summons one more. Looses it....aaaaaand he is out of mana. What? Why? Why didn't you use some real magic?! In the books, he easily defeats Geralt - the best swordsman of the realm. Twice. What do we see here? His ass is kicked by Kahir. Kahir! A character, that has never shown any special abilities. Why did you do this to Vilgefortz, Netflix?! :*(\n\nNext: suicide mages of Nilfgaard...oh my god is that stupid. You have shown previously, that mages can use life of other things to cast stuff when Tissaia used a flower for vingardium leviosa. Soooo...why can't you bring a herd of sheep as a source of energy? Why do you have one-use mages? To show that Nilfgaard is EVIIIILLLLL? OK, bring slaves instead of sheep: it's both logical and evil-looking. But do we really need this excessive evilness? Nilfgaard is not a Sith empire, after all. \n\nSo yeah... \nI hope that the reason for magic being...well, pathetic is just lack of money. And in season 2 we'll see a real Vilgefortz, a real Yennefer and some really cool magic. Cheers!",

        "title": "I think Jaskier was in love with Geralt in episode 6",
        "body": "To be clear, I'm not arguing that I think this is a good ship or valid interpretation. I literally think the show runners are deliberately writing Jaskier as bisexual and - at the very least in episode 6 - in love with Geralt (for poor Jaskier's sake, I hope its a passing infatuation).    \n\nWhy:  \n 1. The song in the closing credits of episode 6 lays it all out pretty clearly. I won't go through it stanza by stanza, but the song contains three characters - the narrator, the narrator's love, and a woman. The first stanza makes it sound like the narrator might be the one in love with the woman, but the second stanza differentiates a third separate character (\"...*Her current is pulling you closer*..\"). So 'his love' and the woman destroying everything are separate people. It's pretty obviously about the episode we just saw - mainly Yennefer and Geralt, but also about Jaskier accepting that Geralt doesn't return his feelings and wanting to stay with him anyway (\"*I'm weak my love and I am wanting; if this is the path I must trudge; I'll welcome my sentence; Give to you my penance; Garroter, jury and judge*\").       \n2. In the first episode Marilka points out that 'Geralt' sounds like 'garroter'. Episode 6 begins with Jaskier writing a love song for 'garroter', and then asking, '*Is the whole metaphor landing, or is it too cerebral?*'. This is a wink to the audience. Jaskier is always making meta jokes (eg. 'there I go again just delivering exposition'), so it is pretty inline with his character to make one here.   \n3. The rest is all circumstantial, but everything fits with the interpretation that Jaskier - at the very least in episode 6, has a big crush on Geralt.    \n\nI personally am a fan of the decision. In the book, Jaskier was a bit of a creep during the dragon hunt. This is a hugggge improvement, and I'm hoping that the success of the Witcher gives the showrunners the freedom to be more upfront about Jaskier's sexuality in the next season.",

She likes dry humor and Fantasy. \n\nThen I saw her watching a Let's Play of Witcher III on the TV. She told me she was surprised she doesn't get dizzy watching it. She then wanted to try it herself and looked up prices. \n\nTold her she doesn't need to buy it. I had it already. She got all excited and literally pushed me towards her laptop to install it. \n\nNow she has a Steam account and I share my library with her. I gave her my controller, so she can sit further away to avoid vertigo. She killed Geralt in the tutorial and runs against every wall, but she will figure it out. \n\nShe loves the landscape, Roach and the story. She is retired and in her early sixties, so she has got time to explore.\n\nI'm so thrilled over this! Gamer-Mama!\n\n\nEdit: Roach is on the roof.",

        "body": "Saw this and felt like it put a lot of the things i thought but was too lazy to write down myself very well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nby Phil James: \n\n\" After 18 of the longest months of anticipation, excitement and hype, I finally completed The Witcher, Netflix’s flagship fantasy series. An adaptation of the book series that sits alongside a very celebrated series of videogames. I consumed each in order of release although I heard about the games first.\n\nI’ll start with a non-spoiler overview of my thoughts and then go a bit deeper into each episode:\n\nOverall, for all the fanfare, The Witcher has been a disappointment. The writing staff have somewhat inexplicably modified many of the best moments in the short stories and added their own side stories that go nowhere.\n\nA shining light in this series has been the majority of the main cast with a special nod to Anya Chalotra’s Yennefer and honorable mentions to Henry Cavill, Joey Batey, Freya Allan, Royce Pierreson and Jodhi May.\n\nWith all that said, the show lies in the realm of mediocre to good. I was entertained by many of the moments in the show, but was far more entertained by their original depiction in the short stories.\n\n6/10\n\nBeware of spoilers beyond this point!\n\nThere was much to love in the show: the goofy humour (particularly between Jaskier and Geralt), Cavill as Geralt, Yennefer in general, Queen Calanthe in “Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials\", the soundtrack and most of the action sequences.\n\nHowever, the show has many flaws the undermine the great moments and prevent the show from reaching the heights it could have reached.\n\nFirstly, *the narrative felt rushed*. I feel that Lauren S. Hissrich made a poor decision in the inclusion of Ciri from the first episode. I understand that she wanted to make the women in Geralt's life have a greater role but the execution was so poor.\n\nI strongly feel that an anthology season would have worked that much better as key stories such as The Lesser Evil, The Edge of the World and The Witcher could have done with more space to develop Geralt.\n\nSecondly, *the writing and creative choices are, at times, very poor.*\n\nAs a lover of the short stories, I thought certain changes detracted from the original work:\n\n* The Lesser Evil was used to set up the grand narrative rather than actually develop Renfri or Stregobor through flashbacks. I thought cutting the Tridam Ultimatum was a huge mistake.\n* The Witcher had all of the political intrigue between Velerad, Ostrit and Foltest erased while giving the king a far more detached, villainous aura. The inclusion of Triss was fine in theory but executed poorly as it was a murder mystery at the expense of political intrigue.\n* The Last Wish changed Geralt and Yennefer's first meeting for no reason whatsoever. The charm of Geralt bringing apple juice to a hungover Yennefer is replaced with a meaningless orgy. Also, having Yen not hear Geralt's last wish is so stupid as it reinforces her connection to him.\n* The Bounds of Reasons was a cheap, poor re-telling. It removed all of the best parts: Eyck's horseback duel, Yennefer turning carts of villagers into frogs with her feet (likely for lack of budget given how Villentretenmerth looked) and they made Yarpen act like a fisstech fiend for no reason.\n* Finally, the last great travesty was not including The Sword of Destiny with a younger Ciri. It utterly undermines Something More and makes Geralt and Ciri's first meeting stupid as they have never met with the added salt in the wound of cutting the Something More dialogue and replacing it with “Who's Yennefer?” We get it, Lauren…\n\nMuch of Yennefer's origin storyline was pretty dull and boring. The plot elements such as the eels and Yennefer defying the Brotherhood and ascending felt very questionable and very High School drama. The poor set design made Aretuza duller than it needed to be. Istredd is a saving grace for many of these original parts.\n\nCiri's whole arc this season failed to develop her character any further than what was achieved in her introduction in the short stories. Dara and The Adonis had no impact on the story other than padding.\n\nAs a Witcher veteran, I understood the timeline but the execution will confuse newcomers. I had to explain a lot to my wife for her to keep pace in the first three episodes.\n\nIn conclusion, The Witcher is an enjoyable if flawed show that pays homage to the books but doesn't quite deliver the greatness anticipated from watching the trailers.\n\nI look forward to Season 2 with tempered expectations.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nagree with quite some here. \n\nadditonally id like to say that both the battle of Cintra and the battle of Sodden had no business being on-screen. They clearly didnt have the budget for these battles, they shouldve just not done them at all instead of doing em poorly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd ofc the Nilfgaard armor. Ive read what the artist thought about it, and Im sure shes a very talented person and whatnot, but this was a mistake, a big one. In one scene in Sodden a Nilfgaardian falls down dead and loses his helmet and you see his head-cloth up near, its pretty much standard ware from the discounter, very obviously sewn with a modern machine. come on. \n\nNilfgaard in general, theyre just one dimensional fanatic villains now (and as someone pointed out to me, the Nilfgaardian soldiers of all people are all white while backwater villages in the north have the ethnic diversity of modern big cities. lol)",

        "body": "I've read the series long time ago, and I had a question I couldn't find answer to ever since. Remembered I had it because the show is talked about so much: what are restraints of magic? \n\nYennifer turned has easily turned scores of people into frogs during the hunt for Golden Dragon, and yet Stegobor seemed to be all but powerless against a bunch of people and was hiding in the tower, and similarly mages didn't seem to be so capable in the last book when riots happened and Geralt had to protect Yennifer with the sword (sorry, I'm fuzzy on details of that one).\n\nSo I wonder, how much you can do magic in that world? Do you get tired? How far it can be cast? Books were never clear to me on those points and I got an impression that Sapkovski was just inconsistent",

How true to the story was the show ? I had always wanted to read them, not sure whether i will after seeing the show.",

        "body": "I was watching [this interview](https://youtu.be/A3FrLM1kI1g?t=272) with Joey Batey (who, for those who don't know, plays Jaskier). The interviewer said that Jaskier was a womanizer, and Joey corrected her, saying:\n\n\"It was something that I really wanted to make clear \\[on set\\], that although Jaskier does enjoy the finer things in life - fine wine, fine clothing, fine company - the stereotypical womanizer character I think is a little played down, and I think it's not particularly interesting to watch anymore.\n\nWe have interpreted it in a slightly \\[stronger, ^(I think)\\] way, it's not that he womanizes, he just falls in love with everyone. He has such a capacity for love, that he will be completely in love with whoever he's talking to, and then they will say, *oh I'm just gonna go and get myself a drink*, and he'll say, *go on, I love you, see you later!* And then he'll spot someone and be like, *I love them now as well*, and it's not that he's chasing, or womanizing, it's the fact that he genuinely just is like a puppy dog, sort of just completely obsessed with whoever is in front of him.\"\n\n\\[this is my own transcript, correct any word you think it's wrong. It should be fairly accurate.\\]\n\nI find these observations pretty interesting from a character-building point of view. And I agree, that's the impression I got from watching the show as well, though I also think he *needs* to feel loved and validated - so he doesn't just fall in love so easily because that's what he feels, but also because he tries to get the same from whoever he's loving.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Obviously I'm not expecting them to use CGI on Anya, Freya and Henry, but I do hope they will do something about the quality of the contacts they use for Henry (for health reasons as well!) and I'm hoping they will drop it when it comes to Freya.\n\nYes, Ciri has green eyes but the contacts on the show are barely green anyway, most of the times it just looks like a mix of green, gray and blue. I'd understand if they would make her eyes a really bright green like the games did and use contacts for that, but this is not the case. In some scenes she isn't even wearing any contacts at all and it just makes everything look way better, even her acting (eyes play a very important part in showing emotion, etc. and with contacts you just have stiff/dead eyes).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1l4mit8qu941.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dd7c6e7e7e167358f489d27dc5912cca8ee33e9\n\nSo are the contacts really worth it in Ciri's case? It makes the eyes look soulless, doll-like and hilariously bad in some scenes, to the point that it can ruin moments (at least for me). Henry's contacts also have this problem of eyes looking like they are about to \"pop out\", they are super bulky and unnatural looking, and the occasional lazy eye is really bad. It's a small nuisance, but there were moments where it really bothered me because I tend to look at characters' eyes when watching the show.\n\nObviously Yen's and Geralt's eye color are really important but I think in Ciri's case, people would barely notice or care. \n\nAnyway, obviously I have a lot of wishes for season 2 when it comes to the story, but I trust the witcher team will nail it, which is why I only have this one small visual request.",

        "body": "A lot of people have their qualms with how Nilfgaard was portrayed and that’s completely fair. \n\nTo me however, I loved how Nilfgaard was used to parallel the growths of two different characters: Fringella and Yennifer.\n\nHonestly, I liked the Nilfgaard plot line because it reinforces just how so many of Yennifer’s issues are part of herself.\n\nFringella was a shy and meek girl who was taken advantage of by teachers as an example (See her hand becoming a crone) and then by one of her oldest friends in Yennifer, who steals away her spot in one of the most reputable kingdoms out of anger and jealousy. Forcing Fringella to be stuck with a king known for molesting his sorceress’s and a laughing stock of everyone else.\n\nBut what do we see happen with the two girls?\n\nYennifers stagnates. She never pushes the envelope, she fails to even relate to the Nobility, she abandons them to death, she blames her decision to become infertile on others, ignores all the pleas and warnings of the one person who actually cares about her somewhat, and proceeds to take over a small town for her own uses and mind-control people into non-consensual sex.\n\nFringella blossoms. Under her guidance, a kingdom that was literally laughed out of Centra becomes a growing powerhouse that slowly but surely begins to terrifying the neighboring kingdoms into submission. She militarized mages and then offered them specific duties in various careers beyond just being advisors. Everyone is fed, even if not high quality, but it’s better than everyone starving. She effectively molded a new King that was courageous, a fierce bowman, and inspired his troops into taking on the then most sought after Kingdom and won. She even played the majority of the Sorcerers against themselves using their classist bigotry and was pivotal in eliminating those who still opposed her.\n\nYenner’s story is all about how she got what she wanted and then wanted more.\n\nFringella is about making the best of what she had and fucking dominating with it.",

Like, they're holed up in their keep, and their entire strategy seems to be to just have a mage protect them with a force field until he... like, can't anymore. Then they seem genuinely taken off guard that this plan didn't lead to their rescue. Were they expecting reinforcements? I seem to recall they already knew the Skelligan (?) fleet had been destroyed. Were they expecting Geralt to just mow down an entire army in their defense? How did it play out in the books?",

        "title": "[Grimdark Magazine] The Witcher show to books",
        "body": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/netflixs-the-witcher-the-books-vs-the-show/\n\nLike many individuals, I was introduced to The Witcher by the CD Projekt Red video games that showed a dark, sensual, cynical, and sometimes humorous world I hadn’t yet encountered in fantasy. Before Joe Abercrombie or even George R.R. Martin, Andrzej Sapkowski created a multi-book epic that incorporated elements from Polish folklore, Spaghetti Westerns, and his own life experiences that was already a nationally popular series in his homeland before it exploded onto the world stage with his adaptations. While CD Projekt Red and Sapkowski have since reconciled after a nasty legal dispute over royalties, the Netflix series is an adaptation of his novels rather than the games that take place a few years after said events.\n\nSitting down to watch The Witcher on Netflix, I was curious how they would adapt the stories as The Witcher is unlike most fantasy series. It begins with two collections of short stories that were initially published in fantasy magazines. These short stories are far from inconsequential and if you were to begin with The Blood of Elves (the first “proper” Witcher novel) then you would probably be at a loss. Instead, it is much better to read both The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny if you want to understand what’s going on in the series.\n\nThankfully, the first season of the Netflix show is a decent adaptation of both The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny. There are many omissions, additions, changes as well as a somewhat questionable timeline but it manages to capture the spirit of the novels. It also conveys most of the pertinent information that sets up The Blood of Elves as a story. I’ll talk about each individual episode as well as their changes below to give a sense of what was kept as well as what was discarded.\n\nWarning: There will be spoilers for both the book as well as show.\n\n**Episode 1: The End’s Beginning**\n\nThe End’s Beginning is a loose adaptation of The Lesser Evil which is not the first Witcher short story (called The Witcher) but one of the better Sapkowski tales that is also, I kid you not, a grimdark parody of Red Riding Hood. Geralt finds a bandit woman named Renfri who is on a mission of revenge against a mad wizard named Stregobor. Geralt establishes his life philosophy of refusing to engage in the lesser evil because, at the end of the day, that’s still evil. The event haunts him in the books but the show portrays the measures he must take to save lives from both individuals as a much greater character development moment than in the books. Renfri’s memory will haunt Geralt for decades to come as he is forced to kill her in a brutal sword fight that helps dub him, “The Butcher of Blaiviken.”\n\n**Episode 2: Four Marks**\n\nFour Marks is the largest deviation from the book as it is a primarily Yennefer of Vengerburg-adapted story. She meets Istredd, her other lover here in a wholly invented story. While she was described as a former hunchbunk in the story, fixed by magic, this is a minor plot detail that is meant to help explain her prickly demeanor. The mages are also more ruthless with young women turned into eels who don’t make the grade. The book also adapts The Edge of the World which is done accurately and depicts the harsh state of the world for elves. We see the sacking of Cintra during this story and Queen Calanthe’s suicide as well, forcing Ciri on the run to find Geralt.\n\n**Episode 3: Betrayer Moon**\n\nBetrayer Moon is an episode that continues Yennefer’s story arc and the idea that she chose to become beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Yennefer of Vengerburg is described as a deformed girl who had her body straightened by the sorcerers and then is sterialized as Tissaia wanted no distractions from her work. Her deformity in the show is portrayed as something abnormal rather than a common affliction among young witches as in the books. Also, sterilization is something that is a consequence of having her deformity surgically removed not something Tissaia did to all young women. The Witcher short story is adapted here with an accurate retelling with the addition of Triss Merrigold.\n\n**Episode 4: Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials**\n\nOf Banquets, Bastards, and Burials creates another Yennefer story where she serves as the King of Aedirn’s royal advisor for decades, only to be witness to him having his wife as well as baby daughter murdered. The rest of the story adapts A Question of Price which is also accurate to the books but has a lot more violence as well as special effects. The episode also has Ciri head to Brokilon Forest where she initially did it in the books before the sacking of Cintra as well as meeting Geralt there, which she doesn’t in the show. The show also claims Calanthe took part in the Great Cleansing and pogroms of the elves, which did not happen in the books.\n\n**Episode 5: Bottled Appetites**\n\nBottled Appetites is a loose adaptation of The Last Wish. The depiction in the show is very accurate with Jaskier (Dandelion in the games) getting Geralt in a conflict with a djinn as well as Yennefer. A wholly invented plot occurs with Cahir, a future ally of Geralts, murdering Mousesack the Wizard (whose fate is uncertain in the books) to replace with a doppelganger. This wholly changes the storyline of “The Sword of Destiny” as well as makes the Dryads almost incidental.\n\n**Episode 6: Rare Species**\n\nRare Species is an adaptation of The Bounds of Reason which is a dragon hunting episode that deconstructs a lot of traditional fantasy narratives. Geralt and Yennefer’s relationship is changed due to their tempestuous long-time arrangement being compressed in the show. Ciri and Dahir’s encounter with the Doppelganger is wholly invented with it being filler to give her something to do until she reunites with Geralt.\n\n**Episode 7: Before A Fall**\n\nBefore a Fall is a compressed adaptation of Something More. The story is much less humorous with much of the back and forth between Geralt as well as Calanthe being played seriously versus for laughs. We also see the Brotherhood of Sorcerers decide to side against Nilfgaard when none of this was ever depicted in the show. Yennefer also tries to talk some young girls out of being witches, despite them not having any magic. Fringilla, who is a moderate Nilfgaardian patriot in the books, is reimagined as a murderous fanatic. Cahir continues to have adaptational villainy, murdering several innocents to find a doppelganger.\n\n**Episode 8: Much More**\n\nMuch More ends the season with an adaptation of Something More. It is completely different from the short story since the short story is Geralt recovering from an injury while hearing about the Battle of Sodden Hill nearby. The battle is dramatized as an epic brutal conflict between Nilfgaard’s and the North’s wizards.\n\nThere are other changes throughout the show, especially visually. Geralt of Rivia only wears one of his swords, the steel one, and keeps his silver sword on his horse Roach’s pack. The cultural and ethnic makeup of the cast is also a bit more diverse, but this is not necessarily untrue of the books. The humans of the Continent come from both the world itself as well as through a portal to our universe via the Conjunction of the Spheres.\n\nThe big changes between the books and show is a matter of presentation as the series shows numerous events out of order, deletes some important ones, and increases the role of both Yennefer as well as Ciri before they enter Geralt’s life. This can be confusing to fans of the books and might be to viewers as the original books were quite well-paced in building to The Blood of Elves. I also regret the loss of characters like Essi Davin.\n\nStill, I think Netflix avoided the mistakes of most adaptations by trying to change the “meat” of the story. The Witcher on Netflix is a dark and brooding series that is sure to delight fans of the books.",

The episode also has Ciri head to Brokilon Forest where she initially did it in the books before the sacking of Cintra as well as meeting Geralt there, which she doesn’t in the show. The show also claims Calanthe took part in the Great Cleansing and pogroms of the elves, which did not happen in the books.\n\n**Episode 5: Bottled Appetites**\n\nBottled Appetites is a loose adaptation of The Last Wish. The depiction in the show is very accurate with Jaskier (Dandelion in the games) getting Geralt in a conflict with a djinn as well as Yennefer. A wholly invented plot occurs with Cahir, a future ally of Geralts, murdering Mousesack the Wizard (whose fate is uncertain in the books) to replace with a doppelganger. This wholly changes the storyline of “The Sword of Destiny” as well as makes the Dryads almost incidental.\n\n**Episode 6: Rare Species**\n\nRare Species is an adaptation of The Bounds of Reason which is a dragon hunting episode that deconstructs a lot of traditional fantasy narratives. Geralt and Yennefer’s relationship is changed due to their tempestuous long-time arrangement being compressed in the show. Ciri and Dahir’s encounter with the Doppelganger is wholly invented with it being filler to give her something to do until she reunites with Geralt.\n\n**Episode 7: Before A Fall**\n\nBefore a Fall is a compressed adaptation of Something More. The story is much less humorous with much of the back and forth between Geralt as well as Calanthe being played seriously versus for laughs. We also see the Brotherhood of Sorcerers decide to side against Nilfgaard when none of this was ever depicted in the show. Yennefer also tries to talk some young girls out of being witches, despite them not having any magic. Fringilla, who is a moderate Nilfgaardian patriot in the books, is reimagined as a murderous fanatic. Cahir continues to have adaptational villainy, murdering several innocents to find a doppelganger.\n\n**Episode 8: Much More**\n\nMuch More ends the season with an adaptation of Something More. It is completely different from the short story since the short story is Geralt recovering from an injury while hearing about the Battle of Sodden Hill nearby. The battle is dramatized as an epic brutal conflict between Nilfgaard’s and the North’s wizards.\n\nThere are other changes throughout the show, especially visually. Geralt of Rivia only wears one of his swords, the steel one, and keeps his silver sword on his horse Roach’s pack. The cultural and ethnic makeup of the cast is also a bit more diverse, but this is not necessarily untrue of the books. The humans of the Continent come from both the world itself as well as through a portal to our universe via the Conjunction of the Spheres.\n\nThe big changes between the books and show is a matter of presentation as the series shows numerous events out of order, deletes some important ones, and increases the role of both Yennefer as well as Ciri before they enter Geralt’s life. This can be confusing to fans of the books and might be to viewers as the original books were quite well-paced in building to The Blood of Elves. I also regret the loss of characters like Essi Davin.\n\nStill, I think Netflix avoided the mistakes of most adaptations by trying to change the “meat” of the story. The Witcher on Netflix is a dark and brooding series that is sure to delight fans of the books.",

        "body": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/netflixs-the-witcher-the-books-vs-the-show/\n\nLike many individuals, I was introduced to The Witcher by the CD Projekt Red video games that showed a dark, sensual, cynical, and sometimes humorous world I hadn’t yet encountered in fantasy. Before Joe Abercrombie or even George R.R. Martin, Andrzej Sapkowski created a multi-book epic that incorporated elements from Polish folklore, Spaghetti Westerns, and his own life experiences that was already a nationally popular series in his homeland before it exploded onto the world stage with his adaptations. While CD Projekt Red and Sapkowski have since reconciled after a nasty legal dispute over royalties, the Netflix series is an adaptation of his novels rather than the games that take place a few years after said events.\n\nSitting down to watch The Witcher on Netflix, I was curious how they would adapt the stories as The Witcher is unlike most fantasy series. It begins with two collections of short stories that were initially published in fantasy magazines. These short stories are far from inconsequential and if you were to begin with The Blood of Elves (the first “proper” Witcher novel) then you would probably be at a loss. Instead, it is much better to read both The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny if you want to understand what’s going on in the series.\n\nThankfully, the first season of the Netflix show is a decent adaptation of both The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny. There are many omissions, additions, changes as well as a somewhat questionable timeline but it manages to capture the spirit of the novels. It also conveys most of the pertinent information that sets up The Blood of Elves as a story. I’ll talk about each individual episode as well as their changes below to give a sense of what was kept as well as what was discarded.\n\nWarning: There will be spoilers for both the book as well as show.\n\n**Episode 1: The End’s Beginning**\n\nThe End’s Beginning is a loose adaptation of The Lesser Evil which is not the first Witcher short story (called The Witcher) but one of the better Sapkowski tales that is also, I kid you not, a grimdark parody of Red Riding Hood. Geralt finds a bandit woman named Renfri who is on a mission of revenge against a mad wizard named Stregobor. Geralt establishes his life philosophy of refusing to engage in the lesser evil because, at the end of the day, that’s still evil. The event haunts him in the books but the show portrays the measures he must take to save lives from both individuals as a much greater character development moment than in the books. Renfri’s memory will haunt Geralt for decades to come as he is forced to kill her in a brutal sword fight that helps dub him, “The Butcher of Blaiviken.”\n\n**Episode 2: Four Marks**\n\nFour Marks is the largest deviation from the book as it is a primarily Yennefer of Vengerburg-adapted story. She meets Istredd, her other lover here in a wholly invented story. While she was described as a former hunchbunk in the story, fixed by magic, this is a minor plot detail that is meant to help explain her prickly demeanor. The mages are also more ruthless with young women turned into eels who don’t make the grade. The book also adapts The Edge of the World which is done accurately and depicts the harsh state of the world for elves. We see the sacking of Cintra during this story and Queen Calanthe’s suicide as well, forcing Ciri on the run to find Geralt.\n\n**Episode 3: Betrayer Moon**\n\nBetrayer Moon is an episode that continues Yennefer’s story arc and the idea that she chose to become beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Yennefer of Vengerburg is described as a deformed girl who had her body straightened by the sorcerers and then is sterialized as Tissaia wanted no distractions from her work. Her deformity in the show is portrayed as something abnormal rather than a common affliction among young witches as in the books. Also, sterilization is something that is a consequence of having her deformity surgically removed not something Tissaia did to all young women. The Witcher short story is adapted here with an accurate retelling with the addition of Triss Merrigold.\n\n**Episode 4: Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials**\n\nOf Banquets, Bastards, and Burials creates another Yennefer story where she serves as the King of Aedirn’s royal advisor for decades, only to be witness to him having his wife as well as baby daughter murdered.

        "title": "[Grimdark Magazine] The Witcher show to books",
        "body": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/netflixs-the-witcher-the-books-vs-the-show/\n\nLike many individuals, I was introduced to The Witcher by the CD Projekt Red video games that showed a dark, sensual, cynical, and sometimes humorous world I hadn’t yet encountered in fantasy. Before Joe Abercrombie or even George R.R. Martin, Andrzej Sapkowski created a multi-book epic that incorporated elements from Polish folklore, Spaghetti Westerns, and his own life experiences that was already a nationally popular series in his homeland before it exploded onto the world stage with his adaptations. While CD Projekt Red and Sapkowski have since reconciled after a nasty legal dispute over royalties, the Netflix series is an adaptation of his novels rather than the games that take place a few years after said events.\n\nSitting down to watch The Witcher on Netflix, I was curious how they would adapt the stories as The Witcher is unlike most fantasy series. It begins with two collections of short stories that were initially published in fantasy magazines. These short stories are far from inconsequential and if you were to begin with The Blood of Elves (the first “proper” Witcher novel) then you would probably be at a loss. Instead, it is much better to read both The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny if you want to understand what’s going on in the series.\n\nThankfully, the first season of the Netflix show is a decent adaptation of both The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny. There are many omissions, additions, changes as well as a somewhat questionable timeline but it manages to capture the spirit of the novels. It also conveys most of the pertinent information that sets up The Blood of Elves as a story. I’ll talk about each individual episode as well as their changes below to give a sense of what was kept as well as what was discarded.\n\nWarning: There will be spoilers for both the book as well as show.\n\n**Episode 1: The End’s Beginning**\n\nThe End’s Beginning is a loose adaptation of The Lesser Evil which is not the first Witcher short story (called The Witcher) but one of the better Sapkowski tales that is also, I kid you not, a grimdark parody of Red Riding Hood. Geralt finds a bandit woman named Renfri who is on a mission of revenge against a mad wizard named Stregobor. Geralt establishes his life philosophy of refusing to engage in the lesser evil because, at the end of the day, that’s still evil. The event haunts him in the books but the show portrays the measures he must take to save lives from both individuals as a much greater character development moment than in the books. Renfri’s memory will haunt Geralt for decades to come as he is forced to kill her in a brutal sword fight that helps dub him, “The Butcher of Blaiviken.”\n\n**Episode 2: Four Marks**\n\nFour Marks is the largest deviation from the book as it is a primarily Yennefer of Vengerburg-adapted story. She meets Istredd, her other lover here in a wholly invented story. While she was described as a former hunchbunk in the story, fixed by magic, this is a minor plot detail that is meant to help explain her prickly demeanor. The mages are also more ruthless with young women turned into eels who don’t make the grade. The book also adapts The Edge of the World which is done accurately and depicts the harsh state of the world for elves. We see the sacking of Cintra during this story and Queen Calanthe’s suicide as well, forcing Ciri on the run to find Geralt.\n\n**Episode 3: Betrayer Moon**\n\nBetrayer Moon is an episode that continues Yennefer’s story arc and the idea that she chose to become beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Yennefer of Vengerburg is described as a deformed girl who had her body straightened by the sorcerers and then is sterialized as Tissaia wanted no distractions from her work. Her deformity in the show is portrayed as something abnormal rather than a common affliction among young witches as in the books. Also, sterilization is something that is a consequence of having her deformity surgically removed not something Tissaia did to all young women. The Witcher short story is adapted here with an accurate retelling with the addition of Triss Merrigold.\n\n**Episode 4: Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials**\n\nOf Banquets, Bastards, and Burials creates another Yennefer story where she serves as the King of Aedirn’s royal advisor for decades, only to be witness to him having his wife as well as baby daughter murdered. The rest of the story adapts A Question of Price which is also accurate to the books but has a lot more violence as well as special effects. The episode also has Ciri head to Brokilon Forest where she initially did it in the books before the sacking of Cintra as well as meeting Geralt there, which she doesn’t in the show. The show also claims Calanthe took part in the Great Cleansing and pogroms of the elves, which did not happen in the books.\n\n**Episode 5: Bottled Appetites**\n\nBottled Appetites is a loose adaptation of The Last Wish. The depiction in the show is very accurate with Jaskier (Dandelion in the games) getting Geralt in a conflict with a djinn as well as Yennefer. A wholly invented plot occurs with Cahir, a future ally of Geralts, murdering Mousesack the Wizard (whose fate is uncertain in the books) to replace with a doppelganger. This wholly changes the storyline of “The Sword of Destiny” as well as makes the Dryads almost incidental.\n\n**Episode 6: Rare Species**\n\nRare Species is an adaptation of The Bounds of Reason which is a dragon hunting episode that deconstructs a lot of traditional fantasy narratives. Geralt and Yennefer’s relationship is changed due to their tempestuous long-time arrangement being compressed in the show. Ciri and Dahir’s encounter with the Doppelganger is wholly invented with it being filler to give her something to do until she reunites with Geralt.\n\n**Episode 7: Before A Fall**\n\nBefore a Fall is a compressed adaptation of Something More. The story is much less humorous with much of the back and forth between Geralt as well as Calanthe being played seriously versus for laughs. We also see the Brotherhood of Sorcerers decide to side against Nilfgaard when none of this was ever depicted in the show. Yennefer also tries to talk some young girls out of being witches, despite them not having any magic. Fringilla, who is a moderate Nilfgaardian patriot in the books, is reimagined as a murderous fanatic. Cahir continues to have adaptational villainy, murdering several innocents to find a doppelganger.\n\n**Episode 8: Much More**\n\nMuch More ends the season with an adaptation of Something More. It is completely different from the short story since the short story is Geralt recovering from an injury while hearing about the Battle of Sodden Hill nearby. The battle is dramatized as an epic brutal conflict between Nilfgaard’s and the North’s wizards.\n\nThere are other changes throughout the show, especially visually. Geralt of Rivia only wears one of his swords, the steel one, and keeps his silver sword on his horse Roach’s pack. The cultural and ethnic makeup of the cast is also a bit more diverse, but this is not necessarily untrue of the books. The humans of the Continent come from both the world itself as well as through a portal to our universe via the Conjunction of the Spheres.\n\nThe big changes between the books and show is a matter of presentation as the series shows numerous events out of order, deletes some important ones, and increases the role of both Yennefer as well as Ciri before they enter Geralt’s life. This can be confusing to fans of the books and might be to viewers as the original books were quite well-paced in building to The Blood of Elves. I also regret the loss of characters like Essi Davin.\n\nStill, I think Netflix avoided the mistakes of most adaptations by trying to change the “meat” of the story. The Witcher on Netflix is a dark and brooding series that is sure to delight fans of the books.",

        "body": "According to [witchernetflix.com](https://witchernetflix.com) Jaskier and Geralt met in 1240. While Geralt and Ciri met for the first time in 1263. So, assuming Jaskier was (lets go younger for the sake of it) about 25 when he and Geralt first met, he has to be around 50 years old at the end of season 1. You cannot really see an age difference in Jaskier in season 1, even though his story takes place decades apart. The hunt for the dragon (when we last saw Jaskier) takes place in 1262. So why does he still look the same age?  \nWell, I just read an interview with the showrunner where she basically admitted that they kinda dropped the ball in that regard. So, basically they forgot to age him up, I guess?\n\nI wonder how and if they will adress that in season 2. Sure, they can make him look older with make up, all of a sudden, but season 2 will start in 1263 (I assume), just one year after we last saw Jaskier, so it would be weird to suddenly age him up.   \nI think the best solution would probably be, to explain his young appearance with magic. I think it would have been cool to have a character in Geralts life that actually ages while he has to watch him grow old, but since they missed that chance, I think an explanation through magic would make the most sense.\n\nWould be kinda lame if they just don't adress it at all.",

        "body": "**This post will contain spoilers that are not yet revealed in the show, keep reading at your own risk**\n\nMy understanding of the story, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that the Usurper is someone who took the throne of Nilfgaard from Fergus var Emreis, and got dethroned years later by the son Emhyr van Emreis. Once Emhyr claimed his throne back, he ordered the scribes to completely remove the name of the Usurper from all archives, and therefore he's become known only as \"The Usurper\".\n\n_Usurper_ doesn't sound to my (non-native) ears as a title of glory or a source of pride. It's unlikely that a king would adopt this as a royal name, or is it? However it's exactly how he's referred to by Queen Calanthe in episode 4. \"Who will take the Usurper's crown, you?\". I know the timeline of the show is a bit confusing, but we know for a fact that this scene occurs before Emhyr's rebellion.\n\nHas the Usurper been called the Usurper even as king? Am I missing something?",

        "body": "I mean, they said that Nilfgaard is far from the powerhouse that it was in the books.. atleast in comparison to the first books.. but in the map it is said about Nilfgaard that it has a thriving economy (and their well-equipped army is a sign of that) and no other nation has conquered so many lands as Nilfgaard - that's the reason they are the biggest nation on the Continent - and it's resources are incredibly diverse + that info about their army which is well equipped..and this is all before Nilfgaard attacked Cintra.. and let's not forget that the showrunners said that the soldiers had very cheap made armors - when in fact the armors looks like it would take a lot of time to make.. all the wringles and patters don't look like they were easy to make + the material looks cheap, that's right..why? because it looks like cheap plastic..  which is a meterial that you wouldn't see in Medieval times or in a fantasy based on Medieval era, but whatever.. \n\nBut there are other strange things written on that interactive map: like for example in the description of the Battle of Sodden Hill, there is a mention about how Foltest with the help from the bannermen from Kaedwen to Skellige, at the end defeated the rest of the Nilfgaardian army that came after Yennefer used her fire powers to burn almost all the Nilfgaardian soldiers.. is this a \"detail\" that we are going to see in the next season? Because in the show they only showed Foltest how he arrived after Yennefer already used her power and it looked like the battle was won in that moment and there are so far no signs that the battle continued after Yennefer's power move\n\nAnd if Calanthé in the show is born in 1216 and Yennefer's transformation is happening in 1210, how the hell can the queen be mentioned already in Yennefer's timeline?\n\nAnd Jaskier looks the same as a 18-year old as when he is 41? I mean, we know that when he is close to 40 in the books, Dijkstra says about him that he looks around 30 but this is just too much and lazy in the show..",

I finished it in two days and have been mulling it over for a while.\n\nI haven't played the games, but I watched the Netflix show when it came out. I liked the show - it had just the right amount of not-taking-itself-too-seriously, catchy songs, jokes, and weirdness for me. I also adore Henry Cavill in everything he's been in, so getting to see him as Geralt was an added bonus. \n\nTHE BOOK: I read it in English, and it made me wish I was fluent in Polish so I could read it in the original language. The writing style reminded me of Glen Cook's Chronicles of the Black Company - not too descriptive, relying on the reader to read between the lines. I felt, though, that some of the nuance of the original language was likely lost. For example, there were some parts that seemed like they should be tongue-in-cheek, but that didn't come through clearly. Does anyone have any other thoughts/info about this?\n\nThere was a lot of casual sexism, which didn't sit well with me (though some of it seemed tongue-in-cheek). The biggest example was when Geralt and Stregobor were discussing the 'monstrous' women of the Black Sun, there was an exchange along the lines of: \"the girls are short-tempered and prone to mood swings\" with a reply of \"how is that different from other women?\" Like, really? Women can't control their emotions? Barf. (Side note: I liked how much of the exact book dialogue the show used, especially from this scene.) Another example is when describing Yennefer's outfit, she wears a purse big enough only for \"a handful of coppers and a lipstick.\" It felt so much like a diminution of Yennefer's power and prestige, reducing her to someone so vapid as to need a lipstick with her at all times. However, the later discussion of the pressures of her profession to look a certain way quells most of my annoyance at that line.\n\nI liked the changes in the show that gave the female characters more social standing, agency, and power, like Calanthe being a queen and general in her own right, as opposed to the book that states that a woman could not rule Cintra alone. \n\nThere were a lot of things about the book I really liked. First, the Cook-like expectation of the reader to fall into the story without too much hand-holding and exposition (I'm currently reading the Stormlight Archive and it's the exact opposite). I love not having every thought and motivation spelled out for me. Even important plot events, like >! Geralt \"condemning\" himself to Yennefer with his final wish !< were not hashed out entirely - the phrasing is vague enough to allow for imagination. Second, the blending of fairy tale into a grittier narrative. I loved the constant references to well-known fairy tales and the overall dark fairy tale feel of the story with the added dread of fearsome creatures. Third, Sapkowski wrote one of my new favorite lines about Geralt and Yennefer >! after Geralt's wish: \"they were caring and tender, although neither quite knew what caring and tenderness were.\" !< I think that phrase says more about those two characters than any other description. \n\nI also liked Dandelion's character, Geralt's interactions with Roach, the descriptions of his witcher powers, and the bizarre timeline. It struck me as odd, though, how different the show and book are when Geralt was talking to Filavandrel >! when Geralt was very clear about himself not being human in the show, in the book Geralt never makes that distinction.!< It had neat implications for how that interaction played out in both versions.\n\nUnfortunately, my library doesn't have the rest of the series as ebooks, so I might just have to bite the bullet and buy the whole series!\n\nThis post ended up way longer than I anticipated; thank you for reading. I'd love to hear other thoughts and interpretations!\n\nEdit to add: not a single instance of Geralt saying \"fuck.\" I was disappointed.",

        "body": "I placed a hold at my library for The Last Wish back in October and finally got the book last week. I finished it in two days and have been mulling it over for a while.\n\nI haven't played the games, but I watched the Netflix show when it came out. I liked the show - it had just the right amount of not-taking-itself-too-seriously, catchy songs, jokes, and weirdness for me. I also adore Henry Cavill in everything he's been in, so getting to see him as Geralt was an added bonus. \n\nTHE BOOK: I read it in English, and it made me wish I was fluent in Polish so I could read it in the original language. The writing style reminded me of Glen Cook's Chronicles of the Black Company - not too descriptive, relying on the reader to read between the lines. I felt, though, that some of the nuance of the original language was likely lost. For example, there were some parts that seemed like they should be tongue-in-cheek, but that didn't come through clearly. Does anyone have any other thoughts/info about this?\n\nThere was a lot of casual sexism, which didn't sit well with me (though some of it seemed tongue-in-cheek). The biggest example was when Geralt and Stregobor were discussing the 'monstrous' women of the Black Sun, there was an exchange along the lines of: \"the girls are short-tempered and prone to mood swings\" with a reply of \"how is that different from other women?\" Like, really? Women can't control their emotions? Barf. (Side note: I liked how much of the exact book dialogue the show used, especially from this scene.) Another example is when describing Yennefer's outfit, she wears a purse big enough only for \"a handful of coppers and a lipstick.\" It felt so much like a diminution of Yennefer's power and prestige, reducing her to someone so vapid as to need a lipstick with her at all times. However, the later discussion of the pressures of her profession to look a certain way quells most of my annoyance at that line.\n\nI liked the changes in the show that gave the female characters more social standing, agency, and power, like Calanthe being a queen and general in her own right, as opposed to the book that states that a woman could not rule Cintra alone. \n\nThere were a lot of things about the book I really liked. First, the Cook-like expectation of the reader to fall into the story without too much hand-holding and exposition (I'm currently reading the Stormlight Archive and it's the exact opposite). I love not having every thought and motivation spelled out for me. Even important plot events, like >! Geralt \"condemning\" himself to Yennefer with his final wish !< were not hashed out entirely - the phrasing is vague enough to allow for imagination. Second, the blending of fairy tale into a grittier narrative. I loved the constant references to well-known fairy tales and the overall dark fairy tale feel of the story with the added dread of fearsome creatures. Third, Sapkowski wrote one of my new favorite lines about Geralt and Yennefer >! after Geralt's wish: \"they were caring and tender, although neither quite knew what caring and tenderness were.\" !< I think that phrase says more about those two characters than any other description. \n\nI also liked Dandelion's character, Geralt's interactions with Roach, the descriptions of his witcher powers, and the bizarre timeline. It struck me as odd, though, how different the show and book are when Geralt was talking to Filavandrel >! when Geralt was very clear about himself not being human in the show, in the book Geralt never makes that distinction.!< It had neat implications for how that interaction played out in both versions.\n\nUnfortunately, my library doesn't have the rest of the series as ebooks, so I might just have to bite the bullet and buy the whole series!\n\nThis post ended up way longer than I anticipated; thank you for reading. I'd love to hear other thoughts and interpretations!\n\nEdit to add: not a single instance of Geralt saying \"fuck.\" I was disappointed.",

And to be fair there are good things here; some of the cgi was ok and I appreciate the fact that they knew when to go with practical effects. Plus the fight between Renfri and Geralt was fun. But that’s about it really. \n\nThe thing that made it the hardest to watch by far were the performances. Everyone was awful and even when Henry Cavill was the best one, he was still quite bad. Something about his body language and the way he speaks makes everything he says sound extremely stupid. The two girls were really bad too, but surprisingly not the worst; Renfri and the queen take that spot; they were just terrible really.  I also think the show looked cheap, the sets looked bad and the makeup on the wizard made him look like a cartoon, but that’s a minor nuisance in comparison to the acting.\n\nI know I sound like a negative Nancy right now, but bad acting really makes me cringe and some of these guys went beyond bad. I’ve heard the show is really good, but I’d like to know if the acting gets better before I commit another hour to watching it.",

        "title": "Theory regarding Stregobor's future role [Time of Contempt spoilers]",
        "body": "Ever since I watched season 1 and saw how heavily they expanded Stregobor's role in the story I had certain theory in my head and though I might share it here to see what other people think. It regards Stregobor replacing a certain mage introduced in the novels and I'll try to explain why I think it's both possible and potentially a good idea. This post will contain some spoilers from Blood of Elves (minor) and Time of Contempt (major) if you watch out for those.\n\nWith how screen adaptations work in general and how season 1 of The Witcher was made in particular, we can be pretty certain there will be more changes in relation to characters' involvement in certain stories - from simply inserting existing characters into events they didn't originally appear in to merging multiple people into one. This is a common practice since it's more beneficial for the show (for many reasons) to establish more developed, recurring characters than a myriad of episodic ones like the novels. We've already seen that there are some changes in the structure of Chapter of Sorcerers with some important characters still missing and other ones being inserted there for the time being.\n\nOne of them is obviously Stregobor who has been given much bigger role in the show as a recurring antagonistic figure as well as an important player in the mages' world. Based on recently released timeline which revealed his age, some people assumed he might replace Hen Gedymdeith in the show. While I think it might be possible (since Hen is more of a lore element than an actual character in the novels), the one I have in mind as a character Stregobor will replace is Artaud Terranova.\n\nWhy Artaud? Artaud, while member of the Chapter, is fairly minor character in the novels, having one scene in Blood of Elves with Vilgefortz and Tissaia and then debatably important scene with Ciri and Geralt during Thanedd coup. I'm referring to the scene where he tries to kidnap Ciri to bypass Vilgefortz and personally deliver her to Emhyr, only for his plan to be terminally foiled by Philippa and Geralt. While this is a nice scene in the novel, it's otherwise devoid of bigger story or emotional impact, because Artaud is fairly unrelated to both Geralt's and Ciri's stories. He is just greedy, pro-Nilfgaardian drunkard who makes some nasty remarks about Yen and the witcher in that Blood of Elves scene.\n\nHowever all of that changes if we were to replace him with Stregobor. Now we have an established character played by recognizable actor, who was already depicted as being antagonistic and disdainful towards Yen and Geralt, who is already implied to be not-really-anti-Nilfgaardian at best and very-likely-pro-Nilfgaardian down the line. He has a history of being a creep with a thing for hunting down magical princesses. Like Ciri. Having him in those two scenes from BoE and ToC (assuming they will even happen in the show obviously) not only doesn't take away from the books, it actually gives much more background and meaning to those scenes by using character who already shares plenty of Stregobor's traits from the show, rather than introducing another. One character with an actual arc over the 2-3 seasons instead of two similar characters with half assed arcs.\n\nAnd think about this: what better end could show's Stregobor arc have than Geralt finally slicing him down to protect the life of another princess he deeply cares about and doing that with a sword that has Renfri's brooch attached to it? I know it may sound like some George Lucas level of heavy handed poetry, but it doesn't even have to be a big focus, just a backhanded reference that people who pay enough attention will catch. You can just have Geralt throwing some cheesy one liner like \"Hmm, got your revenge after all.\" while looking at his sword (and brooch) covered in Stregobor's blood. I think it would benefit the show more to merge those characters and give Stregobor impactful character arc with parallels to Renfri's story rather than wasting time to introduce Artaud as a new minor character. And since they already gave Stregobor much bigger role on the show, it wouldn't make sense not to use his character in some meaningful way down the line. If they pulled this off, I think it would be really amazing use of character and setting up a more meaningful version of that otherwise minor scene from the books.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is there some merit here or am I reaching too much?",

        "body": "Just a little connection I made, which may help others struggling with making sense of how The Witcher jumps between timelines - there's a similar, scaled down approach in the recent movie Dunkirk. For those who saw it, anyway.\n\nIn Dunkirk, three stories were woven together. There was a tale of frontline soldiers that took place over the course of a week, a civilian boatman whose story encompassed one day, and a high intensity airforce arc with 1 hour on the clock. The clincher is...they all \"ended\" at the same point in time.\n\nSo, to dumb it right down, if the climax happens at midnight on Sunday, then we've got a story covering Mon-Sun, a story covering all of Sunday, and a story covering 11pm onwards on Sunday. But the POV bounces between them.\n\nDunkirk is easier to follow, due to the lack of crossover with characters between arcs, but making the link in my own mind certainly helped me wrap my head around what The Witcher was doing. An arc spread over hundreds of years (Yen), an arc spread over a few decades (Geralt), and an arc covering a matter of days/weeks (Ciri). But all converging in the final episode.",

Which, come to think, is also folklore.\n\nCan one of you literary types tell me what I'm talking about, please?",

        "body": "So, this might be a bit of a weird request.\n\nI haven't seen or read *The Witcher* as of yet, but through the power of the internet, I've learned about Jaskier/Dandelion, which renewed my curiosity about this kind of character - the very clearly defined comic relief in your standardish Medieval European Fantasy story, that is considered annoying by other characters and/or the audience, and essentially exists to prove the moments of levity.  Being a bard seems to help, but not be necessary.\n\nThe reason for my curiosity is I got the sense from Brother Longfoot in *The First Law* that this was a specific character type, which is deconstructed in that series through the annoyance being played up.  I also got this understanding from The very meta novella, \"Spiderlight\", where one character, your standard rogue/thief, is pretty clearly defined as \"the one there to make annoying jokes\".\n\nOne of the few straight example I'm familiar with is Fflewddur Fflam from *The Book of Three* (incidentally a bard).  The other would be Moongloom from *The Elric Saga*, who I would assume inspired Jaskier, since Elric himself inspired Geralt.\n\nAre there other notable examples of this character type?",

I have three theses, some of which I find  more credible and  some less credible:\n\n1. The single novel \"Season of Storm\" will be included as well and the storylines of Yennefer and Ciri will be created.\n2. The 1st  half of the first novel of the saga, \"Blood of Elves\", will be included  until and including the fight against the elves (Scoia'tael) when the  convoy of Yarpen Zigrin is attacked, or the fight with the Aeschna.\n3. All remaining short stories will be adapted.\n\nI  let you judge which of these theses you find more realistic and maybe  you have an even better thesis than me. So, what do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: In the case that there is such a post already, please post the link below.",

        "body": "Okay, so in the books there are two types of dwarfs - humans with dwarfism (like the private detective Fenn) and fantasy-creature dwarfs (like dragon slayer Yarpen). And in Polish, they are described with two separate words. So Fenn is a *karzeł* while Yarpen is a *krasnolud*. And *krasnolud* types of dwarfs usually don't look too much like real life dwarfs. \n\nWhich is why, when I first watched the series, when Ciri meets a dwarf servant in the refugee camp, I assumed that was a human, and the way his mistress treated him was because she was just that horrible kind of person. But then in the dragon hunt episode, the fantasy-dwarfs don't look any different from human-dwarfs. So now I have been rewatching the series, and I saw the dwarf servant again, and now I am confused. Was he actually a fantasy-dwarf? \n\nHow is the show going to differentiate those two kinds? Are the dwarfs with Scottish accent fantasy, and without it humans? Or maybe only fantasy dwarfs can grow beards? Or are they going to act like real dwarfs don't exist?\n\n\\[I'm not a native speaker, I hope I didn't word anything in a weird or insensitive way\\]",

        "body": " Let me start out by saying I am a Witcher 3 Gamer. I have not read the books (purposely so, as I do not want major spoilers for the series) but I was wondering what people's opinions are on Book Yennefer vs. Netflix Yennefer vs. Witcher 3 Yennefer. First off, I really like Anya Chalotra as Yennefer. She is a very good actress, attractive, and is very charismatic. The issue from what I have seen so far, is that the Netflix Yennefer differs from the Witcher 3 Yennefer in a few subtle and not so subtle ways. I find that version of Yennefer in the Netflix series is insecure, arrogant, and appears strong only to hide her weaknesses. I might even go as far as saying sometimes she can be a B\\*tch. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy the character and she is still very likable. However, conversely I find the Yennefer in Witcher 3 to be confident, clever, playful, witty, and strong without a hint of insecurity. I also feel she is the best written and well rounded character in a game, ever. Kudos to CD Project Red. My question is this. Is her portrayal in the TV series, similar to the one in the books? And if so, does she mature as time goes by as she becomes Ciri's mother? Also, what are peoples opinions of whether the TV series should eventually adopt more of a Witcher 3 style Yennefer to make her even more likable and a role model. My belief is the show-runners should do this and if they did, she could be a legendary TV character. Can I get some insight from book readers?",

        "body": "So, I own all the Witcher games.  I actually bought a *physical copy* of the first game from a store when it was new, and bought the other two off Steam during Summer Sales.  I did try to play the first game, way back when, but the version I got was the one where the English dialogue was really poorly translated, and was almost incomprehensible.  I gave up, and never got back to it even after they released a massive patch with re-recorded dialogue.\n\nThe main reason I've never managed to play the games, though, is that I've kinda absorbed, via cultural osmosis, the idea that Geralt is some 14 year-old boy's idea of a cool badass.  He's got white hair and yellow wolf-eyes, and he's gruff and only speaks to say something shatteringly concise, incisive and cynical.  And he's awesome at fighting and gets to fuck all the hotties.  And that just sounds so dull.  But, people adore those games, particularly the third one, and so I always intended to at least give the games a fair shake.\n\nBut having now watched all eight episodes of the show, I saw my assumptions about Geralt confirmed.  I'm not even sure why Cavill is getting so much praise for a role that was undemanding.\n\nI also just generally thought the show was poor.  The scripts were the real downfall.  In general, the dialogue was bad in that way that fantasy dialogue so often is, but the overall plot was this meandering mess.  The characters basically just wander aimlessly for an entire season while the actual story happens in the background, and then gets told (not shown) to us.  And then they get super overly melodramatic about it, without having had any real buildup to justify the drama.\n\nIf the consensus from fans of the games or books was \"The show missed the mark\", I might still have some interest in playing the games, or picking up the books (which seem to be very well liked on this sub), but people seem to agree that the show lives down to the standard the books and the games set, so...yeah.",

The dwarfs were to be bait for the Scoia’tael, get slaughtered and then the reinforcements would arrive to finish off the Scoia’tael.\n\n2. The dwarfs would side with the Scoia’tael, prove their disloyalty and get slaughtered by the reinforcements.\n\n3. The dwarfs would prove loyal, fight back and hold off the battle until reinforcements showed up. Some would die, the Scoia’tael would die, but they would ultimately prove loyalty to the Crown. This is what actually happened.\n\nIs this basically the entire premise of the chapter or did I miss something?",

        "title": "Review: Baptism of Fire (The Witcher #4) by Andrzej Sapkowski - 4/5",
        "body": "http://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1777-baptismoffire\n\n4/5\n\nBaptism of Fire is the fifth book in the Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski. A big fan of the series, I've enjoyed the previous novels and reviewed them here on Booknest. For those unfamiliar with the series, it follows monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia awith his adoptive child Ciri as they struggle to make their way through a corrupt world where the nobility is selfish, the peasantry is uneducated, and war is horrific.\n\nThe series started more funny than grim with Geralt living through several fractured fairy-tales such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Snow White. Since Blood of Elves, however, they have been their own original fantasy epic which followed Geralt dealing with countless forces out to seize Ciri for the purposes of fulfilling a prophecy even they don't understand.\n\nWhen last we left our heroes, Geralt had been beaten within an inch of his life by the cruel mage Vilgefortz while Ciri was forced to flee through an unstable portal which dumped her in the middle of a Niflgaardian desert. Adopted by a murderous band of highwaymen, Ciri has begun an unhealthy relationship with bandit Mistle due to her desire to not be left alone. Likewise, the North is being savagely looted and burned by the Nilfgaardian Empire due to the failure of its nobility to do anything to check them.\n\nGeralt, finally recovering from his wounds, is spurred to action by a dream of Ciri which lets him know she's alive. Unwillingly attracting a collection of oddballs, misfits, and badasses every bit as much so as himself, Geralt sets out to rescue his daughter from whoever might be threatening her. Ciri, meanwhile, degenerates further into insanity while we finally find out what happened to Yennefer and why she hasn't been looking for Ciri herself. So what do I think of this volume? Eh, it's pretty good.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with Baptism of Fire, don't get me wrong, but it's very much a road story which doesn't get to its destination by the end of the book. Geralt and his oddball collection of traveling companions get to know each other, have some adventures, and they get slightly closer to their destination of meeting with Ciri. I can't say it's my particular favorite in the series. I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a book of filler but I can't help but think Sapkowski could have inserted an actual plot too.\n\nNewcomers to Geralt's \"hanse\" (or friends who travel and fight together), are Zoltan the Dwarf, Milva the Huntress, Cahir the renegade Nilfgaardian soldier, and Regis who is very-very obviously a supernatural being disguised as a human. Aside from Dandelion and Milva, none of these individuals really have a reason to help Geralt but agree to journey across the land facing immeasurable dangers for a girl they don't know. Indeed, they practically force their help on Geralt who makes several attempts to get away from them. I'm not sure it's not meant to be a parody of traditional fantasy given it seems more or less like a stereotypical Dungeons and Dragons game, \"You guys all meet, now here's the adventure.\"\n\nDespite this, I can't be too hard on the book due to the simple fact it's so damned fun. Of the Hanse, I think Milva and Regis are my two favorite characters. Milva is a friend to the dryads and elves but neither of these two \"persecuted\" groups is particularly good themselves. She's desperately in love with Geralt but he doesn't even notice her interest. Regis is a wonderful parody of an overused stock monster and watching him cope with his \"addiction\" as well as the difficulties of being a highly educated man in the superstitious North was well played.\n\nAll of the characters are interesting and unique, perhaps too unique, and they play off of each other well. I'm also impressed Sapkowski actually has Ciri go crazy, for lack of a better term, due to her experiences which would have broken most people and does, well, her. The fact the relationship with Mistle reverses its power dynamics, starting with Ciri's assault, only to switch to Ciri when she realizes Mistle is a broken scared girl herself is quite clever (if horrifying).\n\nAnother thing I liked about this volume is it deconstructs the Chosen One narrative a great deal. Ciri is portrayed as the product of a centuries-long genetics experiment which only got lost because, well, it wasn't working, and only started to work by accident. This doesn't make Ciri the kind of person who can save the world but the subject of a dozen or more schemes to forcibly impregnate her or dissect her or marry her. Worse, all of the enormous power she was supposed to wield has been sacrificed due to a magical accident last volume. In short, she's a Chosen One who cannot actually be the Chosen One and her life is being ruined by it. Good writing, that.\n\nOverall, Baptism of Fire is a dark and entertaining but ultimately kind of meandering volume which I recommend for fans of the series but note isn't perhaps the best volume Sapkowski has done. I'd give it a lower score but it's still pretty damned enjoyable and mostly just suffers in comparison to its predecessors. I like how Ciri went through a transformation in this story where she adopted being a murderous bandit that would normally be a villain. The fact Geralt is trying to rescue someone who rapidly went bad is an interesting twist. I think the Mistle/Ciri \"romance\" is problematic to say the least and not terribly enjoyable but helps underscore what a journey Ciri has gone through. As for Geralt's hanse? Well, it's a little stereotypical that Geralt assembles a bunch of oddball heroes by sheer accident but they're a fun-fun bunch.",

According to the “Time of Contempt” 60 Nilfgaardian florins can be cut from 1 mark, making Yennefer worth 240 florins (not accounting for inflation). This makes her worth more than a trebuchet, which costs 200 florins. \nIf you convert florins into Temerian Orens according to “Last Wish” rates you find that Yen was worth a little less than the bounty Geralt was paid by King Foltest to break the curse of the striga (about 270 florins). \nSo you could say Yen is worth about the same as 2 diamonds, a ruby, three pretty nephrites, and an interesting agate.",

If it isnt me reacting to smallest inconvinience. My friends who didnt watch the show use the gif because it is so accurate. \n- yen leaving f o u r m a r k s on her wrists and Tissaia calling her Piglet because she was worth less than a pig \n- the foreshadowing of Yens absorbing power in the bottle scene\n- renfri saying \"silver works on me\" it was so small and so powerfull\n- chireadan had a vibe of a slightly creepy but lovable exchange student who fell in love with the badest bitch on campus it was amazing\n- all hints at timelines - calanthe's first battle, young foltest \n\nWhat about you guys?",

It would have taken the form of a fifth co-op scenario, with Leon and Claire always sticking closely with each other at all times to increase their odds of surviving and escaping the zombie-infested Raccoon City.  And, for players who would rather play solo, the other four playable scenarios will always be available.\n\nI'd also like to go for The Witcher trilogy, with a second player controlling a wide range of different characters Geralt encounters on his journey, like Triss Merigold, Vernon Roche, Iorveth, Yennefer, etc.  And the reason is because, to me, the most interesting part of The Witcher trilogy were the opposing factions and their wide range of different characters, from the Northern Kingdoms, to Nilfgaard, to the Scoia'tael, and Skellige, monsters, and the Syndicate.  And these factions have a *slew* of different characters who would have made for potential co-op partners for Geralt, like his hansa in the original books.",

The world of the games is bustling, with vibrant colours and locations filled with all kinds of props and objects, giving a really lived-in feel. It felt like there just wasn't much personality to the locations here in the show. Apart from some nice vistas and exterior situating shots, I can't really think of any locations which really stood out. A lot of grey and muted colours where there was real potential for more. The palace in Cintra stands out as an example of this. Royal locations in medieval fantasy are usually extremely grand, as they should be, with vibrant artwork and warm light covering the halls. The main hall in the palace here has just this general beige tinge to the entire structure, with the only real colour coming from some of the costumes and food.\n\nThe large battles felt similarly low-budget, and it wasn't a problem of scale. It seemed to be a bunch of random quick shots of very basic fight choreography, with nothing looking particularly professional. The exception is the Blaviken market fight scene in the first episode, which is simple but very slick and well done. Unsurprisingly, this was different fight choreographer than the rest of the season, supposedly brought on to re-shoot this fight.\n\nOverall I was dissapointed by the series, because it felt like it could have been so much more than it was, and ended up being much less than the sum of its parts. Henry Cavill is great as Geralt, and I think he probably saved the show for me.

        "title": "Is there a kind of Fantasy I'd like?",
        "body": "My usual response to hearing about fantasy is \"I hate fantasy!\" And this is frustrating to me because I love roleplaying and while temperamentally I'm suited to a non-dungeon crawling version of D&D, I won't play it. I hate D&D. I'm bored by Tolkien, I would like Martin but while he has points he shits the bed with unhealthy cynicism and grimdark. I want to play the Witcher games, but I can't give two shits about it's world.\n\nBasic problem is this I'm a bottom-up world builder, I find themes, points and such contemptible because it distorts whatever truth might be in your work. \nThe worlds aren't relatable enough, the whole medieval statis thing, the completely lack of technological progress, alchemical, magical or technological in hundreds or thousands of years isn't even accurate of the pre-civilization period of 10,000 BC to  4,000 BC, much less the end of the Bronze Age to the beginning of the Renaissance (1100BC to 1500 AD).\n\nThen there's the whole.....well I firmly believe in the killer ape theory and the elves the orcs the humans and the dwarves would have murdered each other out of existence before agriculture, or been so interbred they would cease to exist as definable species if interfertile. This is because of hunter-gather tribes have no concept of extended kinship: the only people who are \"truly human\" as we understand it. Anyone not in the band, whether black skin and broad-nosed, or green-skinned and with tusks, or even fair-skinned and blond like you but with different tribal markings, all are equally monsters/others/subhumans. There's a very chilling part of Diamond's World Until Yesterday where certain New Guinea tribes expressed hatred for their neighbors to the point of looking forward to homicidal feuds with them, who looked just like them but lived in the valleys over the next hill. He points out many of them have wives from these hated groups, and they basically shrug and tell him \"So?\"\n\nOnly with the coalition-building required of for state development can a human group graduate to ethnic consciousness and racism as we understand it. \n\nI see fantasy as useless because there's' nothing true about it. And the funny thing is, I have no interest in fantasy because it's too soft in terms of scientific hardness but I don't care for hard sci-fi because it's too hard. Both assume a kind of stasis in understanding, both are stagnant and dead, Both are after the end of history. \n\nI do have a kind of fantasy I might like, and I'd want to take a crack at myself if it's not been done before, and it would look something like this:\n1. Physics AND magic, not magic instead of Physics: the material universe must operate under the same laws as our own: no Discworld's held up by Elephants riding a turtle, stars are balls of critical fusion cores, not holes to the God realm as per the Elder Scrolls, etc, etc.\n2. Magic is applied to as many economic uses as the difficulty of the magic rules allow. If this means that every king MUST be a Mage to survive so be it. If it means Mages are less Harry Potter seekers of the obscure and more pseudo capitalists.\n\nIn the work I fleshed out, because of magic medicine, child mortality is a LONG defeated issue and though the tech of the setting is 16/17th century in most respects, they've already gone through the demographic transition. Children are rare the old with means are spry and the prime levee fodder in villages are not teens and young adults but middle-aged men. Men like Mulan's father are put on campaign because for monarchs looking at long term stability see the deaths of young men, who have not yet had children, to be more devastating then the death of older men who have. And professional mercenary bands are stocked with men in their 60s and 70s who have 50 years fighting experience and are worth 5 or 10 times their own number, even when they are less cost-effective because they spent so much of their pay on healing potions for arthritis, scarring, and hips popping out of place. \n\n3. Monsters preclude human civilization. If a peasant with a stick cannot handle a monster, neither could a hunter-gatherer band forge in such territory. This means areas with monsters, including Kobolds and Goblins are will be a permanent frontier.\n\n4. If you have mountain-dwelling dwarves or tree-dwelling elves, fine, but they need be built as original hunter-gatherers. Tree villages are a kind of agrarian society to say nothing of Underground city Dwarves.\n\nI designed a farmer dwarf character, which was rejected because she and her fellow drawves were nearly human in appearance. She was very tall but not the tallest at 5'6. (which would be like being 6'4 or 6'5 as a human woman, although she's a LOT lankier than a stereotypical dwarf, halfway between a dawrf and a human) Why? because tunnel living is going to stunt growth and give advantages to stouter, smaller people, just as people who live high in the mountains have barrel chests and people who live at high but subarctic regions develop light skin to get in all the Vitamin D. \n\nI designed very human-like other species because they lived in human-like societies. A Dwarf woman who's never seen the inside of mountain city grows crops and has a childhood more in common with Tom Sawyer than Gimli. A half-orc raised in an all half-orc small city right out of medieval Switerland (or a black town in Jim Crow American South) and educated like a human and with two married half-orc parents who were both raised by married half-orc parents, isn't going to have your typical half-orc hangups. \n\nI know enough about comics to know that generally, pop culture tends to get more banal and boilerplate kinds of speculative fiction. Star Trek: TOS was great sci fi....for the 1920s, or so I've heard it said. So maybe there's something up my alley I've never heard of.\n\nBut, lest you think I'd like Martin, I wouldn't. Cause his whole premise is flawed. Men like Aragon and Ned Stark are good men, and it doesn't matter what their tax policy is because they are humble enough to hire crack advisors and not let their ego get in the way of running things. >!Having Ned die is fine, necessary, heroes DO get outmaneuvered and destroyed by court politics, Admiral Yi is proof of that.  Repudiating his philosophy leads to well....season 8. Besides I need a Luke Skywalker to root for. He doesn't have to be a chosen one, nor particularly powerful or competent, just viable and always someone to root for. Rob Stark or Jon Snow could have been that but Rob was murdered horrifically!< and I don't trust Martin enough to back Jon Snow.",

I'm a 21 year old University student from the UK doing a top up year for Creative Industries (like business studies for freelancers) as I've already completed my degree in Artistic Makeup and Special Effects, and this will be for one of my practical modules.\n\nPlease reply to this with the types of prosthetics that you feel the market is currently lacking, with a full description of the prosthetic (e.g. \"Ciri's cheek scar from The Witcher 3\")\n\nThanks in advance for any responses, I reached out to a UK Cosplay group on Facebook and they rejected my post and I'd really appreciate the help from people who are experienced in this craft!",

Wait... what ?\"*\n\nFor people like me who read the books first, before playing the games, it kinda came as a surprise (as I mostly binge-read through the books in one month without taking time to think about it or elaborate theories), but it's not a very well guarded secret. Most people know about it.\n\nSo, how would you deal with that reveal ? :)",

Ciri also mentions, \"I've heard the ballad\" (about Calanthe's victory) and Eist comments about pretty ballads hiding bastard truths.. hinting at Jaskier? \n\nWhat do you think, has Ciri been brought up so sheltered that she's never heard of the Famous White Wolf, or do you think she at least knows/guesses something. She didn't seem to have any idea about who Geralt of Rivia is, so she can't have heard Jaskier's famous Toss a Coin... thoughts?",

Cause to me it seems more and more like they're heading off into fanfiction land with this child and brother of Francesca? They claim they learned from their mistakes in S1 and yet if taken literaly, they're adding two original characters related to Francesca who doesn't even appear in Blood of Elves... and I'm here trying to understand why... why do they insist on producing their own original material when S1 showed that most of their own stuff was simply not up to par with the books... (from what we've seen, the reactions to most of the writers' stuff were mixed at best, with Yen's expanded backstory being an exception)\n\nAnd not to mention the danger of cutting Philippa (which I personally don't believe even though it does look like it at the moment)... that would be a big blow to the future stoylines given how much influence she has on the narrative as a whole...\n\nI'm not ranting nor complaining, it's just I feel like they're playing with things they shouldn't... however, I am super happy that we're getting Francesca, I could have sworn she was gonna get cut... though I don't see what she'll be doing in S2, unless she's gonna serve as our POV and >!her scenes are mostly gonna consist of scheming with Nilfgaard and Vilgefortz as she should be doing at this time in the books...!<",

I loved how involved in the politics Geralt, Yen and Ciri were without wanting to be. The world around them dragging them into itself was so interesting. The series so far has been so much fun, with my favorite scenes being anytime Geralt, Yen, and/or Ciri are together (I don’t like hearing about them independently as much - I love seeing the three interact). Coming to find out (SPOILER) much of the rest of the series is Ciri on her own becoming a killer (which is the exact opposite of how she reacts to Cahir in ToC), Yen as a statue and Geralt farting around on his own sounds just awful. And learning how Geralt and Yen die - that Ciri just spends time farting around through different worlds - I hate it. It feels totally different than the first four books and I’m really annoyed to learn the direction the series goes. I’m contemplating if I even want to finish it at this point. Anyone else hate how different the series feels after ToC?",

The ending where a chapter is spent with the trappers cursing at each other, then a 16 yr old Ciri gets raped by a woman, really put me off.\n\nIs it worth sticking with the series?

But the spanish version, well, let's just say that they should have picked a dubber that actually knew how to sing. But now I'm seeing comments of people actually defending this, since they state that **in the books Jaskier is a bad singer**. \n\nI've read the books years ago as soon as they got translated to my language (spanish).  I've also played all three games, and I don't remember reading that Jaskier was a bad singer. He was recognized and also revered even by elves (not by the Scoia'tael, but those critics can be dismissed as biased).\n\nSo, can anybody point me a passage from the books where it is clearly stated that Jaskier can't sing?\n\nEdit: [video](https://youtu.be/3Kk_0eTXBLc) for those of you who are curious about the Spanish dub.",

        "body": "Sorry, but this question has just been bothering me. As we see from the sack of Cintra, when Nilfgaard invades a city, they kill and mutilate everyone in that city. However, if that's the case, then who the hell is left at the end of Nilfgaard's conquering to populate those cities and kingdoms? Are they just leaving endless ghost towns behind? Conquering the Continent and leaving nothing in their wake? \n\nWhat's the point of doing that if they're trying to add countries and people to their Empire? How are they then going to maintain control over the areas they've conquered, since they can't conquer literally every square foot of the continent?  It's not practical if you want to maintain control and don't have the resources to cover an entire huge landmass with endless troops.\n\nNormally I would have written the \"killing and mutilation\" off as Queen Calanthe's propaganda, and assumed her poisoning her entire court & castle staff was a scorched earth policy (which definitely tracks with what we know of Calanthe's personality - *if I can't rule over them, neither can you*), but the show went out of its way to show exactly what she described as genuinely happening.\n\nI know Nilfgaard is based on Ancient Rome, to some extent, but when Rome conquered a city, they enslaved the men and (iirc) sent them back to the capital. There were still citizens left alive in the cities they conquered, so the place could still run. After all, what use is there in ruling over nothing? That's not conquering, that's destroying.\n\nThe other historical invasion Nilfgaard seems to be based on is the Crusades. My medieval history is rusty, but in the Crusades, I can buy complete destruction and annihilation, because they were trying to conquer and control an extremely geographically small area. They weren't trying to conquer and control a massive continent.\n\nAm I just missing something really obvious here? Or is this another one of those 'the writers employed really asinine battle tactics because they thought it looked cool onscreen' situations, like season 8 of another show that shall remain nameless?",

I liked him a lot, he was so happy to be useful again and really gave the feeling that he enjoyed his work. \n\nHe had such a eventfull trip with having Ciri prophesize his death, then seeing the manticore and meeting Geralt twice. Then after all that hard work he asked Dijkstra just for a few hours of sleep that would have saved his life but he was denied, matters of state were to important. And lastly the elf that killed him did it on a whim basically and probably started a war since the message won't be delivered.\n\nI don't usually get attached to secondary characters in books/movies but it was something in the way Aplegatt was presented that just made me like the guy a lot. Goes to show that Sapkowski has real talent and I should have started reading him long ago.",

Or they give us a short epilogue with some version of \"happily ever after\" for the main cast.\nThis is mostly understandable and I can see why it's done that way in many cases.\n\nBut I'm that type of person who gets really invested in the world when reading a series I like, and I would love to know how it all turned out for everyone and the world after the final conclusion, in many cases I would happily read a separate book just detailing how it all turned out detailing the life's of every one and the rebuilding effort, resolving the final lose threads perhaps dotted with a few minor problems for our heroes to resolve without any world ending stakes\n\nSo my question to you is what books/series would you most like to have known more about after it ended. Because you felt there was some unsolved elements, or just a world you loved and would like to read more about",

        "body": "I've finished the Witcher series - it was awesome! Although I still have Season of Storms left to read (I'll come back to it when I'm craving more Witcher stuff!). \n\n**My book rankings:**\n\n1. The Tower of the Swallow\n2. Time of Contempt\n3. The Sword of Destiny\n4. Lady of the Lake\n5. Baptism of Fire\n6. The Last Wish\n7. Blood of Elves\n\nLet me know your rankings!\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* There is a lot of reference to \"the white frost\" and Ciri setting alight the world, then we didn't see that occur. Same goes for the Wild Hunt / Naglfar. Are we meant to think that is going to happen in Ciri's future (after the books), or did I miss the significance?\n* They (Geralt, Yen and Ciri) all end up in Avalon (King Arthur's world), does this mean they died? I assume that the healing attempt failed and Yen sees Tissaia (who is very dead), and they drift off in a spectral boat (like ghosts/spirits). I liked this ending but some of what Ciri says at the ending confused me. Sapkowski often tells events in non-chronological order and I only realised at the end that Ciri's conversation with Galahad came after the rest of it all. How did Ciri get to this other place (through the fog?) did she die too? And how does she also know about Yen and Geralt getting married, etc.? (Also gutted that we didn't get to see the wedding!) I think I'm really mixed up!\n* When Geralt and Yen are reunited and Vligefortz defeated Geralt lies to Yen about having slept with anyone else, and she fully believes him. Did anyone else think this is kind of sad?\n* I didn't fully understand the significance of Nimue and the oneiromancer. Was it simply a story-telling device? \n* Has Sapkowski ruled out writing any more about Geralt/Ciri and the crew? \n* Anyone who has played the games after reading the books, is it even better than without?",

I'm not sure it was ever mentioned in the books.\n\nOne thing I always found intriguing was her signing her true name as Skylark before she committed suicide. Pretty much implies she was a peasant girl (like Yennefer). And also, it's such a contrast to her nature as we know her in the books and the show. To be named after a bird.\n\nI'm not necessarily saying I want the show to try and explore this part of her (I kind of like the mystery) though a hint here and there would be interesting.",

I'm re-watching the show!\"\n\nUpon re-watching it, a few things of confusion occurred to me (I guess I didn't catch these holes until watching it again). Now, Vilgefortz is supposed to be this bad-ass. We see this at the battle of Sodden Hill (bad ass scene, by the way!) but he gets his ass handed to him like it was nothing by Cahir of all people. Now, this is the same Vilgefortz who *is to be super respected, and is supposed to destroy Geralt* in a sword fight, shattering his femur, because Geralt is trying to stop him from taking Ciri (with her Elder blood and all; mega powerful girl) before Ciri jumps into the portal to sends her to the Frying Pan where she practices the forbidden fire magic.\n\nVilgafortz was the one who coducted the whole \"Duney and Parvetta being killed in the boat wreck\" scheme so he could get his hands on Ciri. But, alas, Ciri wasn't on the boat. Vilgafortz made this whole magical storm to kill her parents for nothing, but Duney (Actually the emperor,  Emhyr var Emreis) survived. \n\nI guess I'm a little confused as to why Vilgafortz was acting like a weakling in the meetings and in a swordfight with Cahir. Was this intentional;? Is he trying to hide his actual big bad identity? And also too, is Nilfgaard putting on this act to be this back water country? Or is Duney even the emperor? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnywhol, just wanted discussion! Thanks all :D",

While it's entirely possible some of them won't make it to the show or are just going to be introduced later, I asked myself a question - is this possible that they could be hiding in plain sight? RI informed [here](https://redanianintelligence.com/2020/02/21/witcher-new-cast-francesca-eskel-and-more/) that Lilly Cooper is returning as Murta. Do you think it's possible that the show could make a change to some sorceresses' age and present them as being in-training (for now)? The name is not a problem, Yennefer and Tissaia's names are not given ones too. That would also explain their previous \"absence\". Maybe I'm just overinterpretating things, but I'm curious of your opinion on the matter. :)",

        "body": "Talking about how Aretuza was portrayed and about how many people were angry with the way it was portrayed.\n\nNow, we know from the books that during Yennefer's time at least, only ugly and unwanted girls got in. In the present time, we know the daughters of the most refined families in Redania attend the school. And the writers adapted this idea. Yennefer was taken by Tissaia in a time when it was normal for sorceresses to take off with unwanted children. But when she returns seventy years later, Aretuza is attended by rich daughters. This is a direct adaption of something mentioned in the books. Clearly the system has changed.\n\nAnd about the sterilization. In the books, it's mentioned that magic naturally does this to sorcerers, yet it's also demanded by Tissaia that all students are sterilized during their studies. And the show, yet again, portrayed this on screen. They didn't deviate much from the books in this regard - the way Yennefer was sterilized was portrayed on screen, in a brutal manner though and many people didn't like it. I found it logical the first time I saw it. We know Tissaia demanded it in the books. And it would have happened at any rate (Visenna is a very rare example).\n\nSo, aside from the magical eels, which makes no sense, everything else they portrayed at Aretuza was a direct, perhaps in some cases, only slightly changed adaptation of the information offered to us in the books. \n\nOne other thing they changed, though it didn't bother me, was how the girls change their appearances. In the show, they only do it once they ascend whereas in the books, changing physical flaws comes in during the second year or the end of the first year, once it's determined the girls have talent for magic. It's a gradual process.",

I'm not entirely sure if I want to continue a series I've begun or start on a fresh one to avoid burnout.  I have enjoyed all of these fairly evenly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Witcher Sword of Destiny\n\n\\- Witcher The Last Wish\n\n\\- Witcher Blood of Elves\n\n\\- KingKiller Chronicles Name of the Wind\n\n\\- Mistborn The Final Empire\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here are the books available to me right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Witcher Time of Contempt\n\n\\- KingKiller Chronicles Wise Man's Fear\n\n\\- Mistborn Well of Ascension\n\n\\- Warbreaker\n\n\\- Wheel of Time Eye of the World\n\n\\- Stormlight Archive Way of Kings  \n\n\nMaybe as an added bit of criteria, I'd prefer a book that can grip me fairly quickly.  Name of the Wind was a tad slow at first but caught my interest about 50 pages in and hooked me.  Mistborn I ended up liking just about as much in the end, but it took me a VERY long time before I began enjoying it.  Around 200 pages in before it stopped feeling like a chore to read.",

Didn't see any posts except for the trailers. I also haven't read the books they're based on.\n\nI'd probably give it a 6/10. \n\nIt's a bit trope filled but was overall enjoyable. Felt like the build up of Tuiri's character being the hero was a let down when it randomly turned out to be Lavinia. The other characters were entertaining, except Arman. Foldo and Jussipio were great, though I wonder if they tried too hard to make Jussipio too much like Jaskier (comedic bard). Did do a happy clap when they kissed, but was majorly let down by the bury your gay trope. Ugh. Also, found it hard to believe that the characters with minimal training were able to hold their own and win against trained knights.  Oh and the epic battle of the hero fighting the dark (which Lavinia just appears out of no where...) was REALLY anti-climactic. Sure, let's just stand there and glow...\n\nHelped pass some time during quarantine.",

        "body": "I've been trying to make a good/evil alignment chart for the soap opera Dynasty from the 1980's (NOT the remake). An example of what I'm talking about is this:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/yl9u6fan1rkz.png\n\nI've got most of it worked out. The way I see it, lawful good is Krystle. She has never and would never sell out to benefit herself, and would never act against her morals. I'm trying to work with as many top billed characters as possible. Obviously I won't be able to have every top billed character, but I'm trying to go with the most significant.\n\nNeutral good would be Blake. He's done some bad things in the name of good before, and done some things that are flat out bad too. At the end of the day though, his alignment is to good.\n\nChaotic good is either Sable or Caress. Either or, because they have shown to be on the good side while being very devious and scheming against the bad side. Both were willing to exploit and blackmail in order to make those schemes happen, and are emotionally driven.\n\nNeutral good would be Fallon or Steven. Both have shown to be loyal to both sides, and have rarely fought against the other side. If they did, it was for personal reasons or moral reasons.\n\nTrue neutral would be Dex. Dex has fought against both sides, and worked along side with and been very close to both sides. His alignment has bounced back and forth frequently.\n\nNeutral evil would be Adam. Adam has been loyal to both sides, but has also dealt some very low blows to both sides. Stooping to lows that Dex never would, bordering on the verge of illegal.\n\nLawful evil would have been Cecil. By the time of his death, he loathed Blake, someone he considered his friend. Although he never acted on it, he was clear in his hate in his dying moments. \n\nChaotic evil would be Alexis. Emotionally driven, and willing to stoop to all time lows by using exploitation, blackmail, threats, and whatever else she needed to do to attack the good side.\n\nThis begs the question, who would apply as a neutral evil? It seems a though nearly everyone else who schemed against the side of good was virtually beneath contempt, and would fit far better in with chaotic evil. Let me know what your thoughts are, or suggestions for other positions.",

But really, I just find entire factions more appealing than one-man armies, mostly because of their emphasis on group dynamics.  It's why, for example and IMO, the least interesting part of The Witcher trilogy *is the witcher* ***himself***, Geralt of Rivia, compared to the Northern Kingdoms, Nilfgaard, the Scoia'tael, and the wide range of other rival factions they surround themselves with within the books and video game trilogy's universe.  It's also among the reasons why we got Gwent, first as a minigame in The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, and then as a standalone free-to-play game, because sometimes the universe of an ongoing series, and its numerous opposing factions, are going to be so much more fascinating than that one main protagonist we go to that series for.\n\nSo would anyone want an army of Doom Slayers ripping and tearing waves of demons as one centralized collective, like in an RTS or Starship Troopers, as opposed to just one lone-wolf Doom Slayer?",

But that doesn’t necessarily make them evil. I mean of course if I’m a Nordling and some Nilfgaardian talked down to me I’d be like offended & etc but can you really blame them? The nordling people are very barbaric and I just see racism and rape everywhere. It’s dark. \nAfter really thinking about how Nilfgaard runs their government/society, they would bring much needed order to the Northern Realms. If they annexed Temeria/Redania/Kaedwen etc. life probably wouldn’t change much for the average peasant. I think structure would help. It appears as though Nilfgaard is somewhat ahead in terms of technological advancement, too. I think Blood and Wine was a good example of Nilfgaard. It was the first time I’d seen it cast in a positive light. Toussaint is filled with a bunch of regular people, just like anywhere else. I think the Nordlings could stand to be a little more open minded. Nilfgaardians aren’t much different from them. \n\nTL;DR: Emhyr Var Emeris is a fucking powerhouse and Nilfgaard is good for the North because they would bring order and prosperity.

        "body": "Edit:\n\nWhy is Carole Baskin even in the story of Joe Exotic?\n\nBecause of Joe's fixaction on her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy is Joe fixated on Carole?\n\nBecause she was working to pass a bill to stop the breeding, buying, and selling of exotic animals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho profits from the breeding, buying, and selling of exotic animals?\n\nJoe Exotic, Doc Antle, Jeff, and many others who work with them or are their employees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho mainly has been telling the stories of Carole?\n\nJoe Exotic, Doc Antle, and people who work with them or under them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho is Carole Baskin?\n\nApparently, I am Carole Baskin, you cool cats and kittens 😽\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal:\n\nI don't understand the full on hate of Carole by viewers. Reddit and the internet has a weird hate of anyone who is for animal rights. But I mean, you gotta admit, even a little, animals are exploited a lot. And I mean a lot, a lot and should have protections from those who exploit them for profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying Carole is a saint, but out of all the big cat business owners, she is the lesser evil. She doesn't breed them, it seemed like Don was the one behind all the breeding. She doesn't sell them. She takes in the no longer wanted cats or the cats that can no longer be taken care of by their owners. Yes, she holds tours to view the cats, but they aren't exploited to put on a show or being passed around for selfies. What she has is straight up a private zoo for her cats to live out their lives. We can get into her personal life if you want, but in the big cat world, she owns and runs a sanctuary rather than a business. The money that comes in benefits the animals, who should come first but rarely do, as seen with Joe and Doc Antle. They're not trying to save the exploited animals, they are the ones doing the exploiting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPut it on a different scale, like dogs. Joe and Doc and Jeff and the other managers are running puppy mills that breed and sell to get that bottom line and make money with the puppies. What happens to those older dogs that won't sell, or customers don't find cute anymore? Put in shelters or worse. Carole is the shelter, only she made it a sanctuary where they can't be sold or adopted because for big cats, people shouldn't be having them as pets and especially not as the entertainment/performers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's many theories I could get into of why I feel people hate Carole because there are many angles: because she's a woman, because she's an animal-rights advocate, because she used the law to fight against exotic animal breeding and selling (so many hate the government), because she's seen as \"the other woman\". I mean, a lot of what was said about Carole in the show came from the 'puppy mill managers'  whose cash flow was threatened by the bill she was trying to pass to stop the breeding, buying, and selling of exotic animals/big cats. Of course they were going to tell you all these stories about how she's a bitch looking to destroy them (the egos on many of them was just off the charts) and Joe Exotic was just that personality where he couldn't hide his emotions, very reactive, and irrational. I mean, look back at all the misfortunes in his life and he really set himself up for these things to happen to him, because he was in it for him and only him. For his pleasures, his desires, and making as much money from every aspect of his life. I mean, why else would you hire a camera crew to film you almost 24/7 if you weren't looking to sell that too for fame and money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, to wrap this up, in short I feel people didn't really pay attention to the show. Their take away was this crazy world of big cats with this outlandish main character, Joe Exotic, and how he lived this crazy life and his reaction to Carole, spinning this tale of the bitch that was personally attacking him and was going to take away his cats. But really what it boiled down to was an egocentric man worried about his bottom line and his cash flow being cut by a potential law that would make him have to stop breeding, buying, or selling exotic animals that were the foundation of how he made money.",

        "body": "Hello all!\n\nLooking for interesting recommendations here : I've scrolled this subreddit for a while before making this post, can't quite find a question like mine.\n\nDo you have fantasy novels to recommend that include interesting characters such as minstrels, bards, troubadours and trouvères, skalds, poets or harpers? A musician character that lives off this trade, potentially shaping the \"historical\" landscape of the world depicted.Extra points if the characters plays the harp, the lute or the recorder/pipe,I'm surprised to never have found any fantasy book starring a minstrel as a main character!\n\nThe only books I can think of are :\n\n1. **Robin Hobb's Farseer** 9-books-ennealogy  with the character *Starling* : >!but like most people, I found her to be a very unlikable - though relatable - character. She's intentionally depicted as this ambitious, egoistical and self-centered character though the eyes of Fitz. But she really encompases the role a minstrel would have in these times. Although there are a few great descriptions of her, she only appears for a couple of pages at a time in the whole nine books!!<\n2. **Patrick Rothfuss's** *Kvothe* : I like the fact that his musicianship is brought forward a lot in the two books. (This series seems to be highly thought of in this forum, I have found it rather unequal). >!The description of his family and the few encounters with Edema Ruh troupes - or Edema lookalikes - were great.!<\n3. I guess **The Witcher** series has the character *Dandelion / Jaskier* in Polish. This series in next in my list, and I've played the game and watched the show, so maybe this character will be fulfilling?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would be interested in a list of books that contain these minstrel-type characters. If you have enjoyable historical fiction to recommend, I'll take this as well! The story doesn't necessarily have to focus on this character but they have to be present.\n\nSome authors I love include (but are not limited to...) : Tolkien without a doubt, Robin Hobb, Orson Scott Card, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Trudy Canavan, Garth Nix, Melanie Rawn, Brent Weeks and I seem to be enjoying Brendan Sanderson! Maybe this will inspire someone, I'm open to other suggestions too!\n\nCheers !",

I'm still at the 4th book of the series so please avoid major spoilers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found out about the TV series from Branderson's Twitter and i couldn't suppress my confused expression from that... Of all the series that can be much more easily adapted to TV why The Wheel of Time? Does Branderson own the rights for it since he's continuing the book series himself? \n\nIt's such a long and slow paced plot with some weird/corny/cliche moments that will either be forced into TV format or be ripped away completely changed. It just doesn't translate. \n\nI took a brief look at the cast and... Well welcome to 2020, Triss Merigold has new friends.  \n\nEvery other Branderson book could be turned into a great movie/tv series/videogame on the other hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut maybe it ends up like The Witcher and i'll be pleasantly surprised. It's just that The Witcher was way more adaptable to that format...",

        "body": "Be prepared for a long one\n\nA few weeks ago, I made a post, asking what moment from the books people were most excited to see on screen. I was re reading Time of Contempt, and had come across the Geralt vs Vilgefortz fight, and thought \"I cant wait to see that, and Thanedd in general, on screen\". So I put up the post, and came back to Reddit a few days later, hoping to see some comments which would make me remember some moments I had perhaps forgotten, or just others favourites in general. I got on, and to my surprise, there was 16 comments. I dived right in, excited to see what everyone wanted to see.\n\n14 of those comments were some variant of \"What they already missed out\", such as Brokilon, Calanthe and Geralt, or some of the short stories that were missed out. But not in a respectful way, in a sarcastic and somewhat aggravated tone, acting as if the show is complete shite. And I'm sorry, its not.\n\nLet me start by saying I love the books. I've read through them a good few times, and the plot and characters are some of my favourite in fiction. They're the perfect balance for me - not too complex like ASOIAF, which as much as I like, can get really boring at some points depending on the character. But their also realistic enough, in that despite having the mythical monsters and Witchers and sorcerreses, none of the characters are really truly good. The show is not as good by any means, that's not what im arguing here. Just in season one, before I go more in depth or each specific subject, I don't feel the same effect is achieved where every character feels morally confusing at some time or another, largely in part due to the exclusion of some stories or content (E.g Yen and Shard of Ice).\n\nThe point being, its not as good, but its still good. I'm going to break this down into three categories\n\nSetting -\n\nI started with this because its the easiest one to discuss, in that the one thing most people seem to agree on in the show is that it has gotten the atmosphere and world of the Witcher pretty spot on. The music is brilliant, the atmosphere is just right, and the places such as Aretuza feel wonderful and unique. You can always tell when the characters are in a different location.\n\nSaying that, it hasn't gotten to some of the most unique places the Witcher universe has to offer, such as Kaer Morhen, Skellige, Dol Blathanna, and perhaps most importantly, Touissant. Judging by season one, they'll do them justice, but if you see this in 2 years and they've butchered one of them, don't blame me, I had very little to work with.\n\nCharacters -\n\nHere's where the problems arise for most people. Plot is debatably even more divisive, which is why im leaving it till last, but here we go. I'll be doing it character by character, mainly only the recurring ones\n\nGeralt - Most people seem to think Henry Cavill did a brilliant job with Geralt. Ive yet to see a serious complaint which a majority has seen as valid. Theres not much more to say really.\n\nCiri - Ciri was decent. That sounds like an insult, its not, its just that she didn't really do much. She shows hints of book Ciri, her conversation with Mousesack while Cintra is fighting Nilfgaard is evidence that she can play the very sharp side of Ciri, but the rest of the season and her scared little girl attitude is pretty inline. I think we have to see more of her before we make a decision.\n\nDandelion/Jaskier - Geralt may have been the star, but I've yet to meet someone who didn't like the shows version of Dandelion. Him and Geralt are hilarious, his songs are great, and I think the change in the fact that hes no longer famous may actually make him better. It certainly doesn't harm him. He's a funny character, and although he does lack something, I'll go into what in the plot.\n\nYennefer - I feel of the main 4, Yen was likely the most divisive. But honestly, apart from appearance, theres no real difference I don't think. She played the vulnerable Yen in Aretuza perfectly, despite it being a somewhat original plot, and she also played the powerful controlling Yennefer excellently\n\nAs I said, the appearance is differing, but honestly, with how well she played the actual character, I think we can excuse shes a bit shorter and less sharp featured than the books describe her (Although I do have to say, the games Yen is pretty much perfect. Speaking of appearance however...\n\nTriss - This is the big one. And to be honest, ive no idea why. Yes, id prefer that she was white, with cornflower blue eyes and chesnut colured hair, but honestly, its not really that important. At no point is her appearance going to affect the plot (Hint Hint) and I really don't think we've seen enough of her to truly judge her. Yes, she looks different, but it doesn't really matter. Its annoying, but ah well, you know? As a side note, people wouldn't be nearly as pissed if she wasn't prominently featured in the games.\n\nFoltest - This was my biggest disappointment. I quite like the actor, but Foltest is supposed to be \"devilishly handsome\" and even Djikstra thinks to himself at the Cintra meetings that he is impossibly handsome. On top of that, hes supposed to be a leader who inspires loyalty, leading by example with a commanding presence. I don't see this guy having that effect. The change to his attitude in the Striga story as well, where he hasn't told anyone of the Striga's origins, and the city doesn't know was an odd thing to change as well. Foltest is supposed to be a great leader with one main floor, hes lecherous. The show paints him as a sub par leader that only went after his sister. Its just... odd.\n\nTissaia De Vries - Tissaia is much more developed in the show, its actually one of the things the show does better. The relationship between her and Yen is therefore more apparent, and it will make her final fate, which im betting the show will do, sadly ironic.\n\nFringilla - This is the second big disappointment for me. The actor was actually fine in terms of playing her, though I must admit its an odd choice to introduce her so early. I'd bet that's more for Cahir's arc though, which I'll get onto in a minute. This however, is, as I mentioned, is a case in which appearance effects plot. Fringilla HAS to look like Yennefer, per the Touissant arc where Geralt only has his fling with Fringilla because she looks like her. As such, its odd to me that theyd cast someone black to play her. As I said, the actors fine, as is Foltests, but they don't fit.\n\nCahir - Cahir is similar to Ciri. He's just fine. He actually is quite faithful to the books in that he seemed to care for Ciri (Before he knew she was a doppler), and im excited to see what the actor can do with a great character.\n\nYarpen Zigrin - Charismatic enough, that's for sure. Again, not enough of him\n\nRenfri - Perfect. Not much more to say.\n\nIstredd - A decent bit more interesting than his book counterpart, largely due to the development of his relationship with Yennefer in her backstory. Its a shame Shard of Ice wasn't in the show, because it would have been more interesting to see the more developed version of Istredd in that story.\n\nVligefortz - Ill talk about what everyone remembers the shows Vilgefortz for in a minute. But I will say, they nailed the charming and nice side of Vilgefortz he portrays before his turn. Im curious to see if he can play the maniachal madman just as well.\n\nMousesack - Though im sort of upset that unlike the books, his death was confirmed in the show after the Siege of Cintra, he was still a much more interesting character. He comes across as kind of... cold in the books, and the show does a much better job as presenting him as a warm and nice person, whom Ciri sort of looks at as an uncle.\n\nEist - Much more developed in the show, I actually really liked Eist. Makes it all the more sad that he died.\n\nCalanthe - Debatably worse due to less screen time, but I felt the essence of her character wasn't lost or diminished despite the fact she wasn't featured as much. She still was a badass queen who took no ones shit.\n\nFilavandral - Filavandral disappears after Blood of Elves in the books. However, the show's portrayal of him as beaten down and somewhat broken by humanities brutality was really cool, and I do look forward to what seems is going to be a more prominent role for the character\n\nOverall, the characters were fairly consistent. Foltest and Fringilla are the two that annoy me the most, but the others changes are somewhat meaningless. As I said, does appearance really affect Triss' character? Cause to be honest, they could have made Dandelion Asian for all I care as long as he was funny but loyal. Maybe you do care, fine. Im not slating you for it at all, I do understand. They've made a pointless change for the sake of diversity. The thing is, I just don't care enough, and im sure a good many of you, whether you have to think about it, or let it stew for a few seasons, youll get over it. Unless of course the actors and actresses cast for the sake of diversity also happen to be bad, in which case ill be there with you, but the juries still out on them.\n\nPlot - \n\nHere we go, the big one. This is probably the biggest problem most people have with the show. The changes made to plots and such which aren't, in their eyes, needed, and make the story worse. BTW, im not touching chronology with a ten foot stick. I don't think its particularly important that the Striga story in the show happens before The Last Wish for example, you may disagree, regardless, my only comments on chronolology will be if it happens at a different time in relation to a character e.g Geralt being at Cintra's fall. \n\nBefore starting on each change, I will say this - Most of my comments are going to be on Geralt's story. The show runners decision to show Yen and Ciri's stories is likely why a lot of the content from Geralt's stories was cut. These 2 are to be main characters, and it would be odd if they were shown to be main characters despite appearing in all of 2 episodes in the first season. I mean, Ciri isn't even mentioned in the books till halfway through the second book if memory serves, and Dandelion gets more time than Yennefer. Saying that, I think their additional story lines, Yennefer's especially, built a stronger character. And now, here we go (I may forget a few, but im fairly sure ill catch the most important ones)\n\nIf memory serves, the first episode is fairly faithful to the original. It changes some things, particularly I think about Renfri's past, but overall its pretty much the same. Seeing the Battle and Fall of Cintra was cool, its in this respect that I think the show benefits from showing Ciri and Yen's perspective. Seeing Sodden, Aretuza, Cintra - It was all pretty cool.\n\nThe second episode is where things really start to change. First of all, Geralt and Dandelion have already met each other by the time they take the contract in the books, and its not of Filavandral's own will that he frees them in the books, but that of the Queen of the Fields, which although is a cool twist, is not particularly relevant to the whole of the Witcher. I enjoy the books version of events more, but I can let it slide.\n\nThe third episode is actually a rare instance where I believe the books actually improve the story, by virtue of having Triss be the one to issue him the contract, rather than Velerad. Although the change from Foltest being completely open about what the Striga is and its origins, but refusing to let anyone kill it to the man whos utterly ashamed makes little sense to me, as its not inline with Foltest's character, I do think Triss' inclusion is result of the foresight the show has in Triss' importance. Its clear when reading the first two books, particularly the Last Wish, that Sapowski didn't know exactly what the future of his series looked like - he didn't know who was now going to be prominent etc. Therefore, the inclusion of Triss early on, regardless of your opinion of her, does the show a great favour, in that it introduces a future character of relative importance to the audience early on. \n\nThe fourth episode is where things start to deteriorate for most people I feel. I must admit, I did get a sinking feeling realising Ciri didn't know she was in Brokilon, because that meant shed never been there, and her and Geralts journey there is quite important. At the same time though, I think the anger of this being excluded is a bit... overblown. Yes, they bond nicely on this journey, but you cannot act as if they wont have ample opportunity to do that next season. Its sad they had to exclude it, but think about it, it wouldn't have fit with the structure they had chosen for the show as is. And although its no where near as good a motive, Ciri instead wanting to find Geralt because of Calanthe's last wish, and Geralt finally taking responsibility for her is a nice arc for them both. Past that, the feast was fairly faithful again, but instead with Dandelion there, and him being the reason Geralt goes rather than Calanthe actually wanting Duny exterminated. And honestly? It may be better for it. We still get Geralt and Calanthe's witty conversation, but also Joey Batey's Dandelion, who is great. Honestly, I don't have many complaints. It sucks they had to leave out Brokilon, truly, but honestly? Its not as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be.\n\nThere was very little changed in The Last Wish if I remember rightly. The show having Geralt actually look for the Djinn to unbind him and Ciri is a better reason than them randomly coming across it while fishing. I do prefer the books version of Dandelion's injury, in which the Djinn just harms Dandelion because he talks too much, and Geralts first wish is actually for the Djinn to \"Begone and plough yourself\". Its a funny gag throughout the short story that was funny, but im also not really arsed about. The other main change is that in the books, Yen actually hears what the wish is, and is somewhat fine with it, while in the show, she doesn't hear it. I didn't like this change. Ill go into why more in the summary, but although I see why they did it, as they needed Geralt and Yen to break up without having to do a Shard of Ice, and it fits considering her worst fear is that no one could love her even if she was beautiful, being that the love is technicaly artificial, it makes sense, but still. \n\nBounds of Reason is quite different, while still maintaining the same key points. The problem with the story is im not sure how far Netflix would have been willing to go with the Reavers characters, specifically their near rape of Yennefer. As such, they instead killed Eyke, who was a real dick in the show, making you see how evil they are while not killing someone you liked. This results in missing the cool fight between Eyke and the Golden Dragon, but honestly, I pity anyone who would attempt that task with their seemingly low CGI budget for that dragon. It misses out a few moments and changes Eykes character, but apart from that, the story itself is fine. The problem for me at least comes in the ending. Yen and Geralts split, while I don't like it, had to be done that way for the sake of time, as previously mentioned. But Geralt and Dandelion's argument? I just... why? The argument was fine for me at first. They both had valid points, Dandelion IS always getting Geralt into shit, but at the same time, to blame Dandelion for Geralts decisions is dumb. The problem however comes in, where does this leave their characters? This argument never happens in the books, they simply separate, and Geralt goes to live with Yennefer. Dandelion is next seen, if memory serves, in \"A Little Sacrfice\", where him and Geralt are perfectly fine, and still good friends, and so it puzzles me that they did this. This is especially since id bet the next time we see Dandelion will be in Oxenfurt, as per the start of Blood and Elves, and so its odd they'll still be at odds by then. Maybe the showrunners have an interesting place to take their relationship but... I don't know, its just odd. Regardless, he's not likely to be seen till late season 2 as is if they follow Blood of Elves, so IDK.\n\nThe seventh episode isn't even a particular story, to my knowledge. It attempts to cover Geralts talks with Calanthe, and his want to take Ciri all in one, while showing the mages council in preparation for Sodden. Its an attempt to tie all up loose ends before the finale in which Geralt meets Ciri. And ive got to say, although I don't agree with every decision that led to that point, they do a pretty good job of finishing it up. Geralt being at the Fall of Cintra doesn't change much apart from he actually follows Ciri, rather than just finding the Cintran camp, and getting rather lucky. The only thing that really bugged me was the clumsy way in which they tied up Istredd instead. The ending to Shard of Ice is great, specifically Geralts repetition of Yens line about the hanging. Istredd being the one to walk away for seemingly just being neglected for a few years, while reasonable, isn't nearly as effective.  \n\n\nThe only thing that struggles past this is Ciri and Geralt coming together. The insight into Geralts childhood is interesting, because although in the books Visenna is cool, shes never seen nor mentioned again. The expansion of her and not knowing if shes real or not is pretty cool. Then theres Sodden. Sodden was sick, but as I mentioned earlier, it also has the one moment that the shows Vilgefortz is really remembered for. Losing to Cahir. I think we all know by now that he threw the fight, likely to confuse those of us who have read the books, even if it was a pretty shit attempt. It has to be, because if not, Cahir just became the greatest melee fighter to ever grace the continent. He cant beat Vilgefortz and then die to Bonhart, that's not how that works. Your kidding yourself if you think the show fucked up that badly \n\nOverall, the plot is worse. Yes. Its a time thing, and although I would have loved to see the majority of these changes reverted, but it doesn't make it a bad show. If I got my way, the show would be extended by two episodes, with A Little Sacrfice happening before the Last Wish, to build Geralt and Dandelions relationship, as well as make Dandelion something more than the comic relief, and Shard of Ice after Bounds of Reason, so Istredd didn't get an awkward little ending in 7, and they don't have to change the ending of the Last Wish in order to create a scenario in which they break up. That would be my personal changes, but honestly, we got a great show that is fairly faithful to some of the best fictional characters of all time. Ill restate: is it as good as the books? No. It is a good show? Yes. \n\nPS If you read through this, thank you for caring enough to do so, even more so if you feel inclined to leave a comment. Just please, I know some of you may disagree, but please be respectful.",

        "title": "One Mike to Read Them All: Negative review of “By Force Alone” by Lavie Tidhar",
        "body": "This book was super disappointing to me, I’m sorry to say.\n\nI love the Arthur story (the Matter of Britain, if I want to sound fancy). I’m always up for a new take on it. I also happen to be a big fan of creative reimaginings, so when I saw on the blurb that this Arthur was a jumped-up gangster from the streets of Londinium I was intrigued. The fact that I also love mob movies didn’t hurt either.\n\n(aside: I didn’t like the book, but I did really appreciate when Sir Ulfius was relating part of the story of Arthur’s rise and he began with, “As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a knight…”)\n\nBut if you’re going to do that kind of a story - taking a known story and applying the tropes of something else - you need to know what you’re doing. A good (bad) example of what I’m talking about is *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*. I love Jane Austen, and I love zombies, but the two together fell flat for me. Mr Collins being too stupid to realize that Charlotte is a zombie, Lady Catherine’s sneering contempt for Elizabeth being trained in the martial arts by a Chinese master instead of a respectable Japanese sensei - they were worth a chuckle, but didn’t have enough to it to make the story worth the reading. A good (good) example is *Sunshine* by Robin McKinley: the Beauty & the Beast fairytale retold as a vampire story. McKinley didn’t just take a known story and swap some of the tropes: she really worked to make a new spin on the tale. She didn’t just tell Beauty & the Beast and replace “the last rose petal” with “the last clove of garlic,” if you know what I’m saying.\n\n*By Force Alone* has Arthur going from street urchin to local gang leader to *capo di tutti i capi* of the assorted Londinium ~~gangsters~~ knights. He controls the Londinium brothels, he’s dealing psychedelic drugs to the worshipers of Mithras, he calls for a meeting of the ~~Five Families~~ six kings of Britain to follow his leadership, setting off a war when they refuse. But this kind of thing can only sustain a story so far, and when the author runs out of Martin Scorcese and Francis Ford Coppola movies he kind of … reaches.\n\nWe have a Lancelot that’s a kind of kung-fu assassin/treasure hunter. We have what I can only call a tribute to the *S.T.A.L.K.E.R.* games. We have aliens for some reason, even more out of place here than in the fourth Indiana Jones movie. By the time the author tries to pull it back to a solemn tone for the inevitable fall of Camelot, it’s just such an absurd tonal shift from everything else that I just didn’t buy any part of it.\n\nI didn’t appreciate how this book handled gender. In the early stages the only mention of women at all was as serving wenches who were literally listed alongside livestock in the spoils of a captured castle. We do meet Igraine (who gets raped by Uther in disguise, of course), and Morgan and Morgause and Nimue and assorted Fae ladies (who are all seductresses, of course). Guinevere seems like an attempt to balance things - she’s a highwaywoman leading a merry band of lady robbers. But we get one brief sequence where she’s a character, and then she mostly exists in the mind of Lancelot as a distraction when he’s treasure hunting and kung-fu fighting.\n\nThis was published by Tor (thanks to them and NetGalley for the ARC), which surprised me. Because this is *really* a book in need of a good editor.\n\nBingo categories: Published in 2020 (should be out in August), and (arguably) Big Dumb Object of all things.",

        "title": "Was Mousesack abandoning Ciri or protecting her?",
        "body": "!SPOILERS!\n\nI really want to like Mousesack, but I realized something that made me question his loyalties. In episode 1 around 48:40 when Ciri is escaping Cintra, Mousesack tells Ciri he is going to keep his promise and turns to go down an EMPTY street. That is the last we see of him (in the present day timeline anyway, I'm not counting the flashback to Pavetta's wedding feast obviously) until episode 4 around 57:40 when he is being dragged behind a horse bound in chains, obviously captured. I thought absolutely nothing of this until my third re-watch of the series (it's a good show, don't judge me lol). In episode 5 around 53:50 when Ciri asks the question, \"Where did you go on that street?\" I realized, 'yeaaaah, where DID he go?' Because when I went back to re-watch the original scene, after Mousesack walks off, not 10 seconds later, Cahir comes riding up on a horse from the same direction Mousesack had just gone. Where the hell was he? Why didn't Mousesack try to stop Cahir before he rounded the corner and saw Ciri? In episode 6 around 18:40, when Dara starts questioning the doppler (who has all of Mousesack's memories in its head) he says, \"Ciri says you vanished into thin air,\" and the fake Mousesack replies, \"We were...I was pulled through a portal by Nilfgaard, kidnapped and held prisoner for days.\" My problem with this is that, 1: If he WAS pulled through a portal, why didn't Ciri and Lazlo see/hear it? We have seen that portals are neither invisible nor silent, and for this excuse to work, he would've had to be kidnapped pretty much right in front of Ciri. 2: If this portal kidnapping is true, and Nilfgaard had the ability to do that to Mousesack, who at the time must have been only a few yards away from Ciri, why didn't they just do the same to her? Make a portal next to her, snatch her up, and that be the end of it? 3: Even though the doppler has Mousesack's memories and is using them to some extent to make Ciri believe that it is really Mousesack --- what if the doppler is lying? He obviously lies about where Geralt is and where they are going, so it stands to reason that he could lie about Mousesack's actual capture. What the hell was Mousesack doing when he walked away from Ciri? I mean we learn in episode 7 around around 4:26 that Mousesack is fully capable of creating his own portals. So why didn't he do that to help Ciri escape instead of fleeing on horseback? Was he just too weak at this point? Also, if Mousesack really wanted to keep his promise but was too weak for serious magic by then, why didn't he just go with her? There was no one in the street and there were 2 horses. They could have all hopped on a horse and fled. Even if Cahir came upon them like he does with Ciri and Lazlo, if Mousesack was still with them surely he could have helped deflect arrows while they rode away. And if he was all out of magic and couldn't do that, then at least when Lazlo was shot he could have grabbed Ciri and continued trying to escape with her. Plus, Mousesack's exact promise was \"to deliver her.\" So why (if he promised to *deliver* Ciri to Geralt) did he ask Ciri if he could \"keep his promise\" but then leave her? That wasn't delivering her, that was... I don't know what it was and that is what is bothering me. It makes no sense whatsoever that Mousesack did what he did. And I'm not saying this to point out a plot hole because I'm not so sure it is a plot hole. I think perhaps Mousesack isn't the great guy we think he is. Perhaps he was a coward and tried to save himself? This show seems to be good at pointing out that all the characters have their good and bad qualities. I think it would have been important to see a brief scene of how Mousesack had been captured if he was indeed fighting to allow Ciri to escape. I think it was intentionally left out to make us question what Mousesack's true intentions had been when he left Ciri with Lazlo. Does anyone have any ideas? I can't tell if this was poor writing or if there may be some ulterior reasoning behind all this. What do you guys think?",

        "body": "\nHey guys I just finished Sword of Destiny, and this question is specifically about the chapter “Something More”... Geralt is helping Yurga in present time. The Dandelion scene is obviously a flashback. Dandelion tells Geralt about the fall of Cintra. Where was Geralt during the fall of Cintra that he didn’t even hear about it? And how soon after that does the battle of Sodden Hill take place that Geralt didn’t know about that either until Yurga told him about it? So basically from what I got out of this is Geralt had no idea a war (2 major battles) took place in his country/ land.\n\n\nSide note: I started my witcher experience by watching the Netflix show, never played the games. I wanted to read all of the books first before I start the first witcher that I got for $10.00 on steam, then I can play 2 and 3 on the Xbox, even though I know they’re technically “alternate universes” and don’t “NEED” to read the books. I’ve read both The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny now, waiting for the rest of the series to come from Amazon :)",

Specifically magic in the traditional sense though.  For example, Min from Mistborn isn’t really a traditional wizard since her magic Is mainly self buffs and limited telekinesis type moves.  Avatar Korra is on the borderline as bending is really not a traditional magic system.  They don’t have to be protagonists.\n\nMy favorite examples are Yennefer from the Witcher and Sypha from the Castlevania TV series.\n\nEdit: What I mean by a “traditional” magic system is one that relies on a good variety of spells, enchantments, and other various things you can do with the magic.  Soft or hard doesn’t matter, as long as it’s as above.  Think D&D, Dresden Files, or Harry Potter.",

        "body": "The Empire of Nilfgaard continues its invasion of the Northern Kingdoms, unaware that several of its most wanted targets are now far behind its lines. Ciri, the missing Princess of Cintra, has joined forces with a band of outlaws plaguing the northern provinces of the empire, whilst the witcher, Geralt, and his band of mismatched companions are now heading into occupied territory in search of the missing princess. But events take an unexpected turn when Ciri is captured by a brutal sellsword and discovers previously unknown powers.\n\n*The Tower of the Swallow* is the sixth **Witcher** book and, chronologically, the penultimate. It continues the narrative from *Baptism of Fire* with Geralt and his party trying to track down Ciri, but it is grander in scale and fortunately not as inert in terms of plot progression.\n\n*The Tower of the Swallow* feels like the broadest-scoped novel in the series to date, with two major stories occurring in tandem and a host of subplots. We get Ciri on the run, being captured and finally realising her true destiny. There's some excellent characterisation in this section, especially of the ruthless sellsword Bonhart and Ciri herself, who is finally realising her own ability to determine her path instead of being passed around between those who would abuse her name or her power. With Ciri largely absent from *Baptism of Fire*, it's good to get back to her story.\n\nWe also get more development of Geralt's party. After their snail's pace journey through a forested warzone in the previous book, they break out of that rut in this volume and make much better progress. There's a bit of a **Dungeons and Dragons** feeling to Geralt's adventures as he gets a party together and they try to follow the important main plot only to get constantly sidetrack by apparently more urgent side-quests. This is all fun stuff, although again the feeling is that the main storyline is really not progressing very far or very fast at this point.\n\nWe also get cutaways to political intrigue in the Nilfgaardian capital, various military manoeuvres as the Northern Kingdoms try to regain the initiative against an overextended Nilfgaard and some interesting scenes as we visit new locations, such as two subplots, set in the northern kingdom of Kovir and on the Skellige Isles respectively, which are both told with economy and skill.\n\nSapkowski's way with witty dialogue and musings on human nature (especially in terms of desperation and warfare) remain intact and it feels like he's here handling a disparate narrative consisting of widely-scattered characters and storylines with a great deal more confidence than in previous novels in the series, even if there is a feeling that this book and the two previous ones could have been telescoped into one, stronger volume with a bit more discipline.\n\nStill, *The Tower of the Swallow* (\\*\\*\\*\\*) continues the story of the Witcher with aplomb and is more enjoyable than the previous book in the series.",

But events take an unexpected turn when Ciri is captured by a brutal sellsword and discovers previously unknown powers.\n\n*The Tower of the Swallow* is the sixth **Witcher** book and, chronologically, the penultimate. It continues the narrative from *Baptism of Fire* with Geralt and his party trying to track down Ciri, but it is grander in scale and fortunately not as inert in terms of plot progression.\n\n*The Tower of the Swallow* feels like the broadest-scoped novel in the series to date, with two major stories occurring in tandem and a host of subplots. We get Ciri on the run, being captured and finally realising her true destiny. There's some excellent characterisation in this section, especially of the ruthless sellsword Bonhart and Ciri herself, who is finally realising her own ability to determine her path instead of being passed around between those who would abuse her name or her power. With Ciri largely absent from *Baptism of Fire*, it's good to get back to her story.\n\nWe also get more development of Geralt's party. After their snail's pace journey through a forested warzone in the previous book, they break out of that rut in this volume and make much better progress. There's a bit of a **Dungeons and Dragons** feeling to Geralt's adventures as he gets a party together and they try to follow the important main plot only to get constantly sidetrack by apparently more urgent side-quests. This is all fun stuff, although again the feeling is that the main storyline is really not progressing very far or very fast at this point.\n\nWe also get cutaways to political intrigue in the Nilfgaardian capital, various military manoeuvres as the Northern Kingdoms try to regain the initiative against an overextended Nilfgaard and some interesting scenes as we visit new locations, such as two subplots, set in the northern kingdom of Kovir and on the Skellige Isles respectively, which are both told with economy and skill.\n\nSapkowski's way with witty dialogue and musings on human nature (especially in terms of desperation and warfare) remain intact and it feels like he's here handling a disparate narrative consisting of widely-scattered characters and storylines with a great deal more confidence than in previous novels in the series, even if there is a feeling that this book and the two previous ones could have been telescoped into one, stronger volume with a bit more discipline.\n\nStill, *The Tower of the Swallow* (\\*\\*\\*\\*) continues the story of the Witcher with aplomb and is more enjoyable than the previous book in the series.",

So he bought some mages and elves to get the loyal mages killed during the meeting. Vilgefortz had his own plan with Ciri of course but for the time being, he pretended to work for Emhyr, because a north in disarray played into his hands.\n\nBut they would never have succeded if only one of three random events didn’t happen:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** The random death of the royal courier, who had the message for Demawend and Meve to stop the provocation against Nilfgaard in Dol Angra.\n\nBecause Tissaia de Vries only helped Vilgefortz and his accomplices due to Ciris talk of the northern kings aggression against Nilfgaard. After hearing this, she stopped believing Philippa and Sabrina and released Vilgefortz and Francesca, who then released the Scoiatael into Garstang and turned the fight to their advantage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.** Yennefers stupid idea to bring Ciri into the meeting in the first place.\n\nWithout Ciri, we cant know for sure how Tissaia would have reacted. Not to mention she put Ciri in grave danger and all the following misery in Korath desert, with Bonhart etc… was because of her decision to bring Ciri into the meeting. I really hate Yen for being so stupid in that moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.** Philippa orders to Dijkstra and his 50 men to go back to their ship and not follow them into Garstang.\n\nSo even if Tissaia had released Vilgefortz and Francesca, without Philippas arrogance to handle the traiters on her own, those 50 soldiers could have stopped the Scoiatael and the northern kingdom mages would have prevailed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf only one of those three events played out differently, Vilgefortz would have lost, following with his execution and a new, loyal chapter to the northern kings. So either Emhyr wouldn’t have started the second war or he’d face a much stronger north with united mages as he did in the first war. So in my opinion, it was a bad plan on thin ice which only worked because the events, Vilgefortz and Emhyr couldn't control, still played out in their favor.\n\n(sry for my errors, english is not my first language)",

        "title": "What new fantasy TV shows are you watching (shows that are still on/airing new episodes), and what makes them special?",
        "body": "Since the pandemic began, I've been watching more and more fantasy television. It's really helped get my mind off things, so I thought it might be good to talk for a bit about TV, since most threads in this sub are about book series. I'm really hoping this doesn't break the \"recommendations\" rule, since it's specifically about fantasy TV shows that are ONGOING (NOT completed/cancelled). Sorry if it does!\n\nMy favorite new fantasy TV shows I've watched during quarantine are:\n\n* **Castlevania.** I'm maybe a little late to the party but this show is so in your face, I love it. It's a nice balance of violent and emotional, and the world isn't terribly unique, but it's just so well executed. The first 3 seasons are on Netflix and Season 4 was recently announced.\n\n* **The Witcher.** I was skeptical that this would work with Henry Cavill as Geralt, but it's actually pretty great! Looking forward to Season 2!\n\n* **Motherland: Fort Salem.** Ok, yeah, it has a weird name and has some rough patches in the beginning, but it gets surprisingly good as the first season goes on. It's about an alternate universe America where witches forced to serve the US military are fighting a guerrilla war against witch rebels. The writers clearly put a ton of care into the worldbuilding, which is so refreshing. Season 1 is on Hulu, and I'm hoping it gets a season 2 because it feels like it has a lot of potential.\n\nI tried getting into His Dark Materials, but I just... didn't love it as much as I loved the book. Maybe I'll give it another go, though. If anyone has any more recommendations please share them with me! I'm quickly running out of new shows.",

        "body": "MINOR SHOW SPOILERS\n\nSo I've seen Netflix's The Witcher about ten times over now, needless to say I loved it. But it isn't a perfect first season, but I am really confident in the showrunner, writing staff, crew and cast for the seasons to come. I listened to a podcast with Lauren Hissrich Schmidt a few weeks ago and any showrunner who happily admits there were mistakes and that they will learn from them is good in my book. My belief that they all really care about the project is just strong as ever!\n\nSo the positives, let's start with the big three.\nHenry Cavill, Anya Charlotra and Freya Allan. All impeccably casted, they really embody their characters. \nHenry just is Geralt, his love for the books and the games plus his persistence in trying to get the role of Geralt is only the beginning of his work in bringing Geralt to life. He got everything spot on, the voice, the physicality, the dry humour, Geralts grimace and hideous smile that is described in the books.\nDespite the critics all saying he never smiles, he does and he does show emotion and it's beautiful. Bravo Henry, bravo!\n\nLots of people were very cautious about the casting of Anya as Yennefer but I think now we're all in agreement that she fucking nailed it. Her pride, her cold exterior protecting her vulnerable insides, the way she basically acted two characters and still made them the same. Yennefer before her transformation is only described very briefly in the books, i really appreciated seeing her before and after. She was just brilliant, bravo Anya!!\n\nNow Freya was an interesting one, the show kind of just filled in the gaps and created some new stuff for her to do while the series went on. We definitely needed to see her before the saga starts so we have a starting point for her. I'm very excited to see her really get into the nitty gritty that is Ciri's story in the books, I think she was an excellent choice. Whenever I think of Ciri the first word that pops into my head is 'defiance' and she absolutely portrayed that. Bravo Freya, bring on season 2!\n\nI see a lot of people complaining about the cast but the cast is one of the shows stronger points, I thought everyone in the larger ensemble did a bang up job! Joey Batey as Jaskier was brilliant, the fact he was already a musician just added to his suitability for the role, he possesses a childlike innocence which he meshes with his natural wit to great effect. You can tell he genuinely cares about Geralt, the chemistry between them is great and it makes me very excited for his role in the saga as the series continues.\n\nSome of my favourite characters from the season include Queen Calanthe portrayed brilliantly by Jodhi May, she really was the lioness of Cintra and I just couldn't get enough of her and King Eist together pon screen, Eist was charming, rugged and down to earth and was brought to life so well by Björn Hlynur Haraldsson.\nThe druid Mousesack, poor Mousesack, a sad ending but so brilliantly played by Adam Levy, his screen presence and charisma were truly a sight to behold. Don't forget he basically played two characters when the doppler took his form!\nMy personal favourite though was MyAnna Buring as Tissaia De Vries. Hers and Yennefers relationship was just perfect and will set up so much for Yennefer when she meets Ciri. The pet name of 'piglet' is obviously a nod to Yennefers name for Ciri. Her poise, her power and command of her words just had me entranced.\n\nNow for some honourable mentions, Eamon Farren as Cahir (VERY excited to see more of him as the show progresses), Emma Appleton as Renfri, Tom Canton as Filavandrel, Jeremy Crawford as Yarpen Zigrin, Lucas Englander as Chireadan the healer, Shaun Dooley as King Foltest (the scene with him and Geralt on the bridge is one of my favourite moments in the series).\n\nRon Cook as Borch Three Jackdaws was a great choice, he brought a real sense of wisdom and experience to the role, delivering his bitter words to Geralt and Yen in the infamous ending to episode six with such emotion. Bravo sir!\nLars Mikkelsen as Stregobor was again another stroke of genius, he's a true heavy, the way he delivers that line to Geralt in episode one kills me every time. \"....she got to you too, didn't she\" URGH what a pro!\n\nFor the most part the costumes were really good, there's a lot of work to be done though, a lot of what I saw people wearing in season one looked dreadful. Not everything obviously, Ciri's blue cloak was gorgeous, as was everything from Cintra actually. The Nilfgaard armour is just terrible, we all know that, the show knows that and have confirmed it is being changed, thank god!\n\nMy favourite sequences from the show are the intercut fight with the Striga and Yennefers transformation, Geralt earning his name as the butcher of blaviken and the slaughter of Cintra. \nPlus Im very happy how violent and bloody the show is. \n\nThe set design and overall production was great I thought, the great hall of Cintra was a particular highlight. The locations they shot in were all stunning and I got a real good sense of what the continent looks like.\n\nThe musical score and soundtrack is the shows greatest strength, what an absolutely stunning job from Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli!\nYennefers theme always makes me tear up, Geralts theme gets me so pumped.\nThe Song of the White Wolf performed by Declan de Barra is such a fitting piece of music for Geralt.\n\n\nThe shows writing was good, there were a few lines of dialogue here and there I hated by not enough to really affect my overall opinion of the shows writing.\n\nI LOVED the timelines, it felt like I was re reading the short story's again! The feeling of satisfaction once all three story lines came together was emence, I understand that it put a lot of people off, especially those who are brand new to the world of the Witcher. Its a lot of information and new names and places to take in, I understand that, but personally I really appreciated the fact that we were trusted to keep up with everything going on.\n\nI take major issues with the handling of the character of Vilgefortz, I understand the need to show his military prowess I guess, apart from the fact he gets his ass kicked. I hope this is tidied up in season 2. I love the casting though, I saw Mahesh Jadu in Marco Polo and thought he was fantastic.\n\nMy only real dislikes are how they repurposed the forest of Brokilon story, I understand that the show is not a direct adaption of the books, but it felt like the weakest part of the series to me. Plus I'm a big fan of the original short story where Geralt first meets Ciri in Brokilon.\nThe battle of Sodden was very different in my mind too, it's only briefly described in the books but in my head it was absolute carnage, like pure blood and guts chaos. Although I appreciated getting to see all the different types of magic being used, Coral KOing fifty Nilfgaardian soldiers in one was astonishing. As was Yennefers finale!\n\nSome of the cgi wasnt great, some of it was, some of it wasn't haha. I think big blockbusters like marvel movies have unfortunately cursed us so if we see something that isn't particularly great it really stands out to us now. But I will say just remember that this isn't a show thst has the luxury of an ENORMOUS budget, its a Netflix show thst has to share its funds with all the other billion shows that Netflix is funding. \n\nJust a final thought, I loved how they really impressed the importantance of Aretuza to the continent, that'll come in handy when the time of contempt series arrives! \n\nI know that the crew and writers will look at season one and will tighten everything up for season two.\nAnd on that note I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the show, it had me crying, laughing, cheering, it scared me, it impressed me and it has left me dying for season 2.\n\nThis is all my personal opinion, everyone's entitled to their own. I've read the books and played the games so Im maybe a little biased lol, but I was so happy with what we got and I just know that the saga will be something special, because this was literally just backstory, world building and context for the real story!\n\nThanks for reading, stay safe!",

The role of magic in the world I also thought was interesting, with these powerful sorcerers acting exactly as you'd expect them to act.

The world is complex and fractured, exploring themes of racism and classism and no one side is truly correct. I liked the Eastern European influence and incorporation of various mythological beings that actually play into the stories. I do wish the story would delve into the history and lore a bit more, but it comes through in its own ways.\n\nAs to the story and characters, I felt that it was well done. There was a large cast of characters and they all felt real and complex, with their own motivations and goals. Sometimes good characters did bad things, and bad characters got redemption. I will say that I was rather dissatisfied with the ending. It was sort of abrupt and left a lot of threads open, but I suppose the games will clear some of that up.\n\nOverall, the series was great.

I wouldn't expect long ten minute banters with deep ethical and philosophical overtones on par with the books, but I did feel like the show made Geralt too quiet. I also know he was a fan of the games and I do think this Geralt is closer to The Witcher 3 rendition than the books'. But being such a big fan of the books, why would Cavill feel the need to pare down his Geralt's dialogue so much?",

There wasn't a self-contained story.\n\nAm I missing something? The story is wildly popular so it must appeal to people somehow",

        "body": "\\*Post summarized much quicker at the bottom if you don't want to read it all\\*\n\nHello, new to this subreddit but wanted to ask you guys for some advice on the series. As quick background, I read both *The Last Wish* and *Sword of Destiny* before starting the series (so I have all that backstory and such) and am currently on *Time of Contempt* (in the middle of chapter 5).\n\nWhat has kept me so engaged in the story thus far is characters. I think Geralt and Ciri are both just amazing characters, and I love reading about their adventures (especially together) and their relationship feels so real to me while I'm reading and their Destiny is what drives me to continue reading these books.\n\nOn the flip side, however, I am really struggling with the way the books are written at times with the constant jumping around. I am still struggling trying to figure out which kingdom is which and constantly being thrown into the politics to try and set the world up is something that I'm really struggling with.\n\nFor example (the scene I am about to reference is as far as I currently am in the story): Geralt got beat up by Vilgefortz and then was brought to Brokolin to heal and get better. Dandelion comes to the forest and Geralt asks him what's been going on, and rather than hearing Dandelion's telling (although we get some of that) we jump to the story itself and learn about it that way. In a way, I appreciate the world building that this gives in setting the stage for the world on a grander scale, not just how Geralt sees it, but I often find myself confused and uninterested by these stories. I know that Nilfgaard is the southern empire invading the North because the emperor wants Ciri (presumably so that she can have his kid who is the \"revenger\" i believe it is called, though I think it's Ciri cause it doesn't have to be a guy) and the Northern kingdoms had an alliance to fight them off. Then the Northern kingdoms plotted to break the treaty and retake Cintra and blah blah (I'm sorry this isn't supposed to be a summary) but the point is all of these politics are going on (not to mention the politics of the sorcerers), and I understand that it all is revolving around Ciri but I just don't feel any connection to the kingdoms or even understand where they are (Cause I thought they had to defend the river crossing i.e. Sodden but then Nilfgaard just took over like 2 kingdoms in a week and Foltest just caved and whatever).\n\nLong story short, I love Geralt and Ciri, but struggle reading about the politics and don't care as much about those things because I haven't been given any attachment to it as a reader. Do you guys have any tips for trying to better understand/appreciate the politics or am I just doomed to not like it?\n\nSorry for the long post, appreciate any advice you all have on the matter.",

I’m not going to tell you who these characters are by the way, and we loved him so much. It’s like, well, “How can we bring him back and make him a bigger part of season two?”",
        "body": "This is a quote from Lauren when she gave an interview to [thewitcher.tv](https://thewitcher.tv) ([link](https://thewitcher.tv/lauren-hissrich-talks-the-witcher-season-1-2)), and I am wondering who she is talking about. Here are my theories right now, but you may have better ones:\n\n* **Borch (played by Ron Cook)**: I would bet on him personally. The dragon has a small appearance in ep8 but I guess if it's him she didn't count it in her statement.\n* **Foltest (played by Shaun Dooley)**: He also has a rapid appearance in ep8. He was supposed to be in S2 anyway, but it's entirely possible that they gave him a bigger role for S2 compared to the counterpart in the books.\n* **Filavandrel (played by Tom Canton):** He has a quite powerful dialogue in the second episode, and since we know the elves are probably be a big part of S2 it wouldn't surprise me to see him more than we thought.\n* Could also be **Yarpen (played by Jeremy Crawford)**, he is a true fan of The Witcher and it was pretty obvious on screen that he had a lot of fun during the filming, so he gave all he had in his performance.\n\nIf you have a character in mind, who is it and how do you think they could bring him back?",

Triss is someone who is strongly idealistic yet is not above playing dirty to get what she wants.  There are meant to be layers to her character - internal struggle -  which is simply not seen in the show.\n\nSabrina is also miscast.

I watched some of the showrunners interviews and iirc they wanted the show to revolve around Ciri like the books then they should rewrite her arc because based on what I watched, I don't think they know what to do with her.  \n\n\nIn addition, the show did a bad job of introducing the threat of the series which is the Nilfgaard and because of it the final episode in which the mages, wizards, sorcerers or whatever they call it defending sodden did not pack a punch.",

        "body": "I happened to see someone on Twitter a few days ago describe their book as \"competence porn\"  and it got me thinking about how *satisfying* I find those narratives. Yes, of course, narratives should have conflict, and if all challenges are too easily overcome that can be its own kind of dissatisfaction. But there are times, especially when I look at the world around me and see how critical problems are being mismanaged at the highest level, when it is a balm to enter the world of a book in which a character is just *really good at what they do.* And if they manage to build order out of chaos or revive a dying institution, so much the better.\n\nThis is a narrative thread I've found myself drawn to in the past. It's the reason I fell for the West Wing - people who are very good at their jobs trying hard to accomplish things and often (but not always) succeeding. Sometimes the protagonists start out ignorant and overwhelmed, but through personal character and the help of their allies they rise to the occasion (see: Myfanwe Thomas in The Rook, or Maia in The Goblin Emperor). Sometimes they're human disasters in a competent trenchcoat who nevertheless manage to drag order out of (sometimes self-created) chaos (see: Miles Vorkosigan, Moist von Lipwig). Related is the quietly practical hero(ine) who doesn't get lost in hysterics or despair and just...gets on with what needs to be done (see: Tiffany Aching, everything Ursula Vernon/T. Kingfisher has ever written). My secret delight is the woman in the space!military who is good at her job and just keeps getting better (see: Tanya Huff's Torin Kerr, or Elizabeth Moon's Heris Serrano). \n\nSo tell me, do any of you feel similarly? Who are your favorite examples of the type? ~~Please tell me about books I haven't read yet that feature competent protagonists, I'm desperate for more~~",

There are things you can do as a non-black person to be an ally, some of these should be instinctive but a lot of them require inward work that takes time and consistency. Check your privilege. Be mad, channel that madness into something tangible. Educate yourself as best you can, protest if it is safe for you and those around you to do so, support and promote black people in spaces they are overlooked, put your money where your mouth is (there are still some links in my story) and most importantly pledge to continue to do this in weeks and months and years from now. Accept that there is more to learn and do and be willing to do it. If you feel pressured by the timeline, that’s a good thing, you’re only a victim of your own conscience and it means you are required to act and you should not hesitate to do so. #BlackLivesMatter, never stop shouting it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Mecia Simson (Francesca)**](https://twitter.com/MeciaSimson/status/1267369478683271170) honoring George Floyd\n\n[\\(Source: Twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/nwcr5snwsk251.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d350893d176803da2ba037606c17dfe2f3eff358)\n\n>This really breaks my heart.

        "body": "1: What happened to the \"unicorn\" that Ciri walked with in the desert? She claims that it was a hallucination at first, but later uses chaotic fire magic to heal its wound. Then when the trappers get there, they remark that she must've rode a horse because they noticed hoof prints in the sand. Ciri kept remarking how unique the creature was, and i really thought it was gonna be a lead up to some big reveal, like it really was unicorn and maybe it would do something amazing. But it just sort of... disappears?\n\n2: Why did Geralt lose to Vilgefortz when he was defending the entrance to the tower where Ciri had fled too? Geralt said that his mistake was not made in the battle, but before the battle, and it was that he should've known better to engage Vilgefortz. Geralt said he slashed at him four different times, where all of them should've been fatal. But he either couldn't hit him or the blade passed through him (I can't remember which), and he was beaten to a pulp, which doesn't make sense to me. Like, Geralt is superhuman, and unless Vilgefortz used some sort of magic, there is no way that Vilgefortz should've won. That really confused me.\n\nNo spoilers for any future books, please. Thank you!",

        "body": "I took an empty template map of the Witcher world, drew the whole book journey on it and printed it as a poster and i wanted to share it with you:\n\nHere is the .jpg version:\n\n[world map.jpg](https://preview.redd.it/8schbav8wp251.jpg?width=5129&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b5d47d025d49d758db3450f6b8a11f2d705b39d)\n\n• direct link (png): [https://s12.directupload.net/images/200603/ofwzowmn.png](https://s12.directupload.net/images/200603/ofwzowmn.png)\n\n• printed poster on the wall (4:3 - 120x90 cm):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqvmmswsxp251.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d9c30d872ce34eee09b0baea99944b763fb8105\n\nClose up: [https://s12.directupload.net/images/200603/3gvto3zy.jpg](https://s12.directupload.net/images/200603/3gvto3zy.jpg)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**• The idea**\n\nThe idea to do this came to my mind during my 3rd rereading of the books. Because I already knew the story by heart, I started to focus on other things, especially Sapkowskis descriptions of places, villages and cities. So everytime he mentioned one place, I opened the map and searched for it to understand the world setting better (yes, I‘m a Witcher nerd :P). As you can imagine, this became quite exhausting, especially during **Baptism of Fire**, when Geralt went on his long journey with his friends while Ciri also changed, or better said had to change locations quite often. I thought to myself, wouldn’t it be amazing to see the complete journey on the map, instead of searching the mentioned locations one by one? While the games have no problem with integrated maps, Sapkowski never drew one for his story, so you have to rely either on your imagination, or the template maps made by fans. So I started to search if something like this existed and only found drawn locations visited in the Witcher games or some marks on templates, but never the complete book journey. So I thought I will do it myself and thus started my little project using Paint 3D, because i neither have, nor know how to use other graphic editor programs.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**• Credit and reason, why i took this map**\n\nFirst i wanted to give credit to those guys i took the template map from:\n\nOrtelius Team [https://wiedzmin.fandom.com/wiki/Mapa\\_Orteliusa](https://wiedzmin.fandom.com/wiki/Mapa_Orteliusa)\n\nTemplate map: [https://i.redd.it/ht2ighn7e5f31.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ht2ighn7e5f31.jpg) (5456x7567 px)\n\nIn my opinion, it’s the most beautiful Witcher world map, perfectly suited for the poster format as well as colour combinations I had in my mind and I had except one time no struggle to follow Sapkowskis sometimes exact, sometimes vague descriptions on it. But what I loved most is that the map takes even the smallest details into account. One example:\n\nIn the start of **Baptism of Fire**, Milva tries to catch up with Geralt and Dandelion. They rode out of Col Serrai in Brokilon to get south to the Yaruga. They followed the Ribbon River, but on the Brokilon bank. Sapkowski wrote further the Ribbon River formed a half circle which bulged into Brokilon. So in order to catch them, Miva crossed the River twice and rode straight through „Burnt Stump“ while Geralt and Dandelion didn’t know the area and just followed the half circle and thus a longer path.\n\nI love that even such a small landmark as a River bulge mentioned only once by Sapkowski is still drawn into this map, so i had no trouble to draw both paths in that area exactly as he described in the books.\n\nThats not the only example, but i think you get the idea, why i chose this map.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**• Map Legend and order explanation**\n\nAs you can see in the map legend, i started with **Season of Storms** and continued with **The Last Wish**. I know Sapkowskis advice is to read **SoS** last to fully understand the story and secondly not to spoil the **LotL** ending. But in terms of the map legend, i find the chronological order more important to fully fathom the complete journey Geralt took from start till finish. And for someone who already knows the ending as well as the whole story, there is in my opinion no reason not to follow the chronological order in the first place, but that's another topic. So in conclusion, i drew the journeys in the chronological order.\n\nThat said, i know **SoS** takes place somewhere in between the short stories *The Last Wish* and *The Witcher* in the book **The Last Wish**, as Geralt already knew Yen in **SoS**, but learned about Foltests contract on the famous Striga in the end of **SoS**. With this knowledge, it becomes clear that the first short story *The Witcher* is chronologically second to last, followed by *The Voice of Reason* where Geralt heals after he gets wounded in this fight. Thus I marked the start of the book **The Last Wish** with the second short story *A Grain of Truth* and the ending with *The Voice of Reason*.\n\nFrom here on out, there are no more difficulties in the timeline, as Sapkowski wrote more or less about everything else in the order it took place.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**• Markings and numbers**\n\nAs you can see, my drawing consists mostly of 2 things: The paths Geralt and some other main protagonists took, as well as some bigger circles around locations or smaller ones somewhere on the path, or even isolated on the map, but mentioned in the books. Those are points of interest I found important enough to mark on the map and which i will explain shortly, because otherwise some of them could rather confuse than explain.\n\nThe number next to those locations point to each chapter in the books, where the location, point of interest or path is mentioned. Except in **SoS** (blue). Because this book has 20 chapters and Geralt visited some locations quite often, I numbered just the chronological order in which Geralt visited those locations to make it more appealing on the map.\n\nFor the short stories, I used their titles instead of numbers. I also marked the start and ending of each book to make it more understandable and appealing.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**• Summarization and explanation of points of interest (circles)**\n\nNow I want to explain those points of interest which are not locations, thus not easy to understand on first sight. I will not explain the big locations, just mention the order, because otherwise it would be a long summarization of the books and you can look it up yourself if you want to.\n\n1. **Season of Storms** (blue)\n\nAnsegis -> Kerack -> Ravelin -> Rissberg -> foothills -> Riverfront (**4**, Geralt forcing Degerlund to teleport him in order to survive) -> Windley -> boat trip on Pontar River to Novigrad (**5**, on Prophet Lebioda followed by a fox demon) -> back to Kerack -> Rissberg (**7**, back to kill Degerlund) -> Kerack -> Inn on the path to Vizima (**8**, Geralt learns about the Striga contract.)\n\nA small change to the books (**3**): I know that Geralt went back to Kerack after Ravelin, where Coral healed his wounds and then went to Rissberg, but because he went that path a second time later, I drew it like this to make both journeys more appealing. I also ignored Nimues part, for the whole project in fact, because neither do we know Vyrvas exact location (she grew up there), nor do we know the location of her tower later in **LotL** other than it’s in the northern kingdoms somewhere.\n\n2. **The last Wish** (yellow)\n\nJust the chronological order:\n\nA Grain of Truth (Nivellens home is somewhere near Murivel) -> The lesser Evil (Blaviken)   -> A Question of Price (Cintra) -> The Edge of the World (Dol Blathanna, Upper + Lower Posada) -> The Last Wish (Rinde) ->  The Witcher (Vizima) -> The Voice of Reason (Temple of Melitele).\n\n3. **Sword of Destiny** (orange)\n\nThe Bounds of Reason (surroundings of Barefield + bridge)  -> A Shard of Ice (Aedd Gynvael) -> Eternal Flame (Novigrad) -> A Little Sacrifice (Bremervoord + Dragons Fangs) -> Sword of Destiny (journey through Brokilon to Duen Canell and back, finishes on the road between Brugge and Verden) -> Something More (starting on a bridge in Mealybug Moors, where Geralt gets wounded and carried all the way by Yurga to his home in Kagen - Riverdell, passing Sodden Hill where the first battle against NIlfgaard took place.)\n\n4. **Blood of Elves** (red)\n\n**Chapter 1:** Cintra, Seat of Friendship and nearby town. **Chapter 2,3:** Kaer Morhen. **Chapter 4:** way south (Triss gets sick, they stopped at a bridge to seek help -> meeting with Yarpen Zigrin and his company a bit further on). **Chapter 5:** Pontar river between Foam and Novigrad (Geralt wants to bait Rience) -> Oxenfurt. **Chapter 6:** Hagge -> Nilfgaard -> Temple of Melitele -> Oxenfurt. **Chapter 7:** Temple of Melitele.\n\n5. **Time of Contempt** (purple)\n\n**Chapter 1:** Zavada and surroundings -> Dorian -> Anchor. **Chapter 2:** Gors Velen (Yen/Ciri) -> Hirundum (Ciri went there to meet with Geralt, Yen followed). **Chapter 3,4**\\*\\*:\\*\\* Thanedd (mage banquet + battle in Aretuza and Garstang) -> Dorian. **Chapter 5:** Col Serrai (Dandelion on his way from Brugge to Geralt) -> Dol Blathanna, Loc Grim. **Chapter 6:** Korath Desert (Ciris path west in order to survive). **Chapter 7:** Way to Glyswen + Glyswen Inn (Ciri was found nearly dead in the Suchak riverbed by the Trappers. They took her to Glyswen, where the rats freed her and took her with them. They crossed the Velda river where the book ends.)\n\n6. **Baptism of Fire** (pink)\n\n**Chapter 1:** Col Serrai, Brokilon -> Tretogor -> Montecalvo -> Fen Aspra (Rats with their new member Falka aka. Ciri). **Chapter 2:** Caen Treise (Geralt and Dandelion following Ribbon river south, Milva chasing after them with a shortcut through Burnt Stump and reaches them shortly after Caen Treise) -> path east (because south is blocked by war) -> meeting with Zoltan + company -> continue east. **Chapter 3:** Fen Carn (meeting Regis) -> Druigh (Rats visited a local peasant feast.) **Chapter 4:** Breza camp, Vissegard took Geralt and Dandelion. **Chapter 5:** Surroundings of Breza (Milva meets Cahir) -> Somewhere in the woods between Verden and Drieshot (Faoiltiarna tells NIflgaards spy he didn’t betray them) -> Nilfgaard -> Vissegards camp (Regis saves Geralt and Dandelion, together with Cahir they continue east) -> Loredo (where Ciri kills a man making fun of her and Mistle - it's mentioned later in the books, but not to confuse things, I kept the chronological order as Bonhart tells it in this order later). **Chapter 6:** Loredo surroundings -> Dol Blathanna -> Montecalvo -> way west (rats raid somewhere on the way a convoi with a baroness, Ciri gives up her cover). **Chapter 7:** way east (Geralts company meet with Zoltan again and part shortly after to cross the Yaruga. They took a ferry, it floats back with the stream to Red Port, where Geralt and Cahir fight against Nilfgaard with Queen Meve).\n\n7. **The Tower of the Swallow** (white)\n\n**Chapter 1:** Temple of Melitele, Pereplut (This location is mentioned in each chapter until 10). **Chapter 2:** Post station somewhere between Jealousy and Fano (Hotsporn tells rats about Bonhart resides to the east in Jealousy) -> way north ( Ciri left rats and went with Hotsporn to Forgeham to ride north and claim her birthright) -> ambush near the river (Hotsporn died, Ciri followed the river back to Jealousy -> Jealousy (rats died). **Chapter 3:** Way east through Riverdell (Geralts company crossed the Yaruga after parting from Meves army in Angren) -> Bremervoord -> Nilfgaard -> way to Riedbrune (after the meeting with a beekeeper). **Chapter 4:** Nilfgaard -> Rocayne -> Malhoun (Skellens crew tries to find Ciri following Bonhart steps) -> Jealousy -> Fano -> Claremont. **Chapter 5:** Riedbrune (Angoulême joins company) -> way to Belhaven (Geralt, Cahir and Angoulême went after Shirru, rest went on to Toussaint). **Chapter 6:** Ore mines east of Belhaven -> battle in the mines (Geralt and Cahir escape, meet with Regis on the way to Toussaint). **Chapter 7:** Tir na Bea Arainne (Geralt meets Avallac’h) -> Caed Myrkvid. **Chapter 8:** Lan Exeter-> NIlfgaard. **Chapter 9:** Kaer Trolde -> Hindarsfjall -> Sedna Abyss (Yens path in finding Ciri). **Chapter 10:** Nilfgaard -> Unicorn -> Dun Dâre (Bonhart decides to sell Ciri to Vilgefortz, they meet in Unicorn, Ciri manages to flee and teleports herself 4 days forward to Pereplut, where Vysogota found her in chapter 1. On the way to Tor Zirael, short stop in Dun Dâre to kill some of Skellens thugs. **Chapter 11:** Temple of Melitele -> Stygga Castle -> way to Mil Trachta, Hundred Lakes -> Tor Zirael.\n\n8. **The Lady of the Lake** (green)\n\n**Chapter 1** (Galahad), **5** (Tir na Lia city, world of the Aen Elle) and **7** (Ciris journey through worlds and time) tell about other worlds, so obviously i cant mark them on this map as well as Nimues unknown tower location (somewhere in the north).\n\n**Chapter 2:** Darn Rowen, Tir na Bea Arainne -> Stygga Castle. **Chapter 3:** On the way to Beauclair -> Beauclairs banquet. **Chapter 4:** Montecalvo -> Beauclair -> Pomerol -> on the way to Malheur Pass  -> Rhys-Rhun. **Chapter 6:** Jarre on the way to Vizima (meet bandits on a bridge, they keep on together to Vizima. After a while stopped and let the military pass) -> Vizima. **Chapter 7:** Malheur pass (Ciri missed Geralts company by a few minutes). **Chapter 8:** Brenna surroundings, Temple of Melitele, Battle of Brenna. **Chapter 9:** Stygga Castle -> Montecalvo. **Chapter 10:** Elskerdeg Pass (Dijkstra, Faoiltiarna and Boreas Mun leave the known map into Zerrikania and beyond) -> Cintra -> Nilfgaard -> Cintra -> Novigrad. **Chapter 11:** Ciri, Geralt and Yen visit all the locations Ciri went through after Thanedd (Jealousy, Fano, Claremont, Unicorn, Dun Dâre).\n\nI didn’t mark them here, because it would just interfere with the original waypoints from **The Tower of the Swallow**, as well as Toussaint, when Geralt and Ciri picked up Dandelion to ride back north. There is simply not enough space in Toussaint to draw those waypoints and it would just interfer/confuse with the previous markings.\n\nThus I started to draw their way back in Dol Angra -> Dillmoor (Ciri rode north to Vengerberg to meet the Lodge with Yen, while Geralt and Dandelion went west to Rivia -> Montecalvo -> **Chapter 12:** Rivia -> end.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThats it, sry for the long post and I'm out of potatos :P\n\nFeel free to add mistakes I made, locations I forgot, questions or other ideas. While I cant correct the printed poster anymore, I can edit the file if necessary.",

I've always seen Nilfgaard as a pretty interesting culture in the universe, as it's pretty different from the Northern Kingdoms. We often get negative accounts from the characters in the universe but like... There are being invaded right now. Of course they aren't thrilled. But in the end, Nilfgaard doesn't really seem worse than the North?\n\nDo you think it's because of the portrayal in the show of Nilfgaard as crazy, evil murderers and rapists that Nilfgaard seems to get an especially bad rep right now? I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty annoyed at depictions of Fringilla and Cahir as religious fanatics. Every single bit of nuance thrown right out of the window.",

        "body": "I mostly enjoyed the series, but can't help but feel it's been rather bluntly hit with a mallet of Hollywood.\n\nThe most noticable thing to me is the lack of dialogue.  In both the Witcher books and games dialogue is a huge part of the story.  Sometimes it's just casual dialogue.  However, instead of Geralt being basically the Larry David of the fantasy world, constantly calling people out on their bullshit while getting in hijinks, shooting shit and having fun with his pals and people he meets along the way, he just grunts.  They made him into the most basic, boring Hollywood male protagonist.  Instead of Geralt, we basically got Vin Diesel's Riddick.\n\nNilfgaard.  Instead of being a complex empire, they are now religious fanatics and stereotypically evil, with evil guy scrotum armor.\n\nEven the Doppler was an evil stereotype.  Was that necessary?\n\nI feel like every change made was just about as cheesy as can be, all focus on the episode at hand rather than the greater picture and feel of the world.\n\nHonestly, I want to love the series - I generally think the acting and the swordplay so far is good... But the writing, aka the most important part of the Witcher series, seems to be lacking.  It's like they didn't learn from Game of Thrones that people don't want things to be streamlined dumbed down.  It's sad because there's so much potential and I'm not sure it will be realized.\n\nI'm still try to remain positive as we look to Season 2.  Do people have similar feelings, disagree, and do you think Season 2 will have similar issues?\n\nEdit: I should add that I really want to see this show succeed.  I love the characters and world of the Witcher.",
