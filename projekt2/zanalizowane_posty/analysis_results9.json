        "body": "I am not familiar with witcher games or books. I have just watched the tv series. In season 1 episode 8 vilgefortz and cahir are fighting on the hill and vilgefortz clearly struggles to fight cahir. And in Season 2 also i don't remember him being that powerful. The reason why i am asking is throught season 3 it's conveyed that whoever is doing this is a very powerful mage, so i thought it might be tissia as when triss mentions that girls are missing to her she acts like doesn't care much about it and also throught the series it is implied that she is very powerful mage (i didnt believe it was stregobor for a second clear miss direction).\n\nAlso i have question about the boat scene where ciri and geralt are fighting the monster. Ciri was careless and if geralt didnt intervene and cut its tail she was in danger, it is no where near how geralt fights monsters. Still after that geralt praises ciri and says he's proud of her which i think was out of character for him atleast he could've atleast criticized her technique and said he's proud how she has come in her training.\n\nOther than these and few minor dialogues i enjoyed season3 part1 so far.\n\nEdit: Oh and i also didnt like the arc of fringilia from being a very powerful mage in season 1 to i don't know what is she even doing in season 3 (i know most people dont like s2 but that scene where fringilia murders all the people on the table is one of my favorite scenes).

I did stay quiet, I did not complain and I did not bring up the books.\n\nOf those half-drunken, mildly-interested guests, half ordered pizza and started talking about work and school while the others grabbed a pillow, closed their eyes to lay down for a bit.\n\nThe first episode was paused right when Ciri, Yen and Geralt were talking to Yarpen after Belleteyn and the Netflix app was closed, minutes later.\n\nThis reminded me of Game of Thrones season 3 episode 9, the 'Red Wedding'… another casual get-together that night, very much like the one today; only difference was, I distinctly remember helping the host empty beer cups because people were glued to the screen and the beer had gone stale. I remember people actually crying and visibly upset, couple of people actually loudly exclaiming \"What the hell just happened? Are they all dead?\"\n\nI'm not in the TV industry, not an actor, not a costume designer, not a composer, not a CGI technician… just a regular guy who enjoys reading/watching/playing \"fantasy\" and I know how powerful a good story can be. How a simple scene like Catelyn Stark explaining how \"all that's happened to this family, was because I couldn't love a mother-less child\" as the music soars can rattle anyone's emotions.\n\nThe Witcher just isn't it. I feel like I lack the words to explain how wrong everything is with this adaptation.\n\nI'm here sitting, only one actually looking at the screen after a certain point and I'm thinking, they are going to show the trip from Kaer Morhen, to meeting Yarpen, to Shaerwedd, to the Scoiatael attack, to the \"Dear Friend\" letter, to the Oxenfurt barge, all in this season… couldn't they just show them how, when and where they were originally imagined? To not drag these lovable characters through the mud and actually tell a heartfelt story? Show Ciri, a young orphaned child discuss racism with the Dwarves? Have Yennefer teasingly call her my sweet ugly one instead of you know, want to murder her? And then seconds later, Ciri is side-flipping through the air to dodge an armadillo on steroids, at Belleteyn… so there's that.\n\nThis half of the first episode, of the first half volume didn't fix anything, it's half ignorant of the mess in S2 (and S1 for that matter) and half \"It is what it is\"; and I am half confused and half disappointed, somehow even more than after watching S2.\n\nSorry for the rambling.",

Why? We’re in need of, in this day and era, to* NOT *be told if you should read something or not. You, kind reader, have a brain, and I want to treat you with that respect by making your own choices. I will recommend all the books I’ve read this month, see if it’s something you might want to read. I use dumbass humor and satire that uncle Lawrence wishes he was this funny.

Went back to good ol’ Texas to burn myself in triple digit heat for 2 and a half months and gorging on curry. However, this also took a nose dive for my book reading….All the while, I was juggling 2 cats in cabin for nearly 20 hours to make sure they didn’t claw the stewards. (My children are extremely happy here because they run around and demand food to their hearts content from their favorite uncle).\n\nJune was a time of remembrance of Junteenth, CEOs being shady (nothing new there), and for 18 hours, the world collectively held their breath.\n\nIn book news, my Kindle is in the equivalent of cryogenic sleep, aka, the Libby hold trick. Basically, I have my Kindle in airplane mode so I can keep a book longer, without affecting the person ahead of me in the waiting list.\n\nFor example, if I wanted to read *Labyrinths* by Borges for longer than 2 weeks, I would put my Kindle in airplane mode, so the next person can get their copy without delay.\n\n…What this means is, I have *The Book That Wouldn’t Burn* in said cryogenic slumber. This also means…all the books I need to read for July are *not in my Kindle. I didn’t plan ahead at all when I found out about this*…yeah, I’m in a bit of a pickle…\n\nOn the bright side, *Gods of the Wyrdwood* came out though!

Imagine that, but art via illuminations.\n\nThis is a book for age ranges of 10-14 years old, but obviously, anyone can read it. If you truly believe you’re an adult at heart, you already don’t know how to live life. Go out and experience something new.\n\nDid I slam the keyboard? Go.\n\nDeborah, experiencing a golden latte is not- you know what? Enjoy it.\n\nThere is a mishmash of certain tropes into a new one and then the usual tropes of Oops! All Parents are Dead! that you’re not sure everyone likes.\n\nYou’ll also read, probably, one of the most epic climactic battles you’ve seen of a YA book. We’ve had *A Wizard’s Guide* where you didn’t think Kingfisher could top it, but because stakes are a little less so, she somehow one ups herself with fighting an angry mandrake that, somehow, is better than most adult fantasy climactic battles you’ve read.\n\nYeah, you’re not sure how it led to this either.\n\n**Ö** Theme: Tumult Crest of a Violent Wave (Arranged Ver.)

Kind of like an Ikea on a Saturday.\n\nYou should see these as original fairy tales, and not “short stories”, if that makes sense?\n\nCharacters are about as one dimensional as two-ply toilet paper, but Hastjarjanto makes up for it by making it short and inserting as many fantasy elements as she can possibly think of. Because you read *Fifth Season* recently, you’re not sure how Jemisin didn’t think of making stone people become vampires. That’s actually genius.\n\nYou also find yourself crying over characters of said two-ply toilet paper that you’re not sure how to process these emotions and then the last short story made you want to shake MCs like, how are you *that* dumb?!\n\nThen you decide to try moonshine while reading the stories and it helped *wash* away your sorrows. And then being disappointed that this wasn’t the strongest alcohol you’ve ever tried, and you can only go higher from here.\n\n**Ö** Theme: Hollow Knight OST – Greenpath: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWquuWkHVP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWquuWkHVP4)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Conclusion**: @\n\nYou may wonder, “Lady, where the fuck is the *Elantris* review?!”… and I’ll tell you, “BITCH, JET LAG!”\n\nI’m having so much fun reading *Elantris* that it’s like getting an agua fresca after being parched in a Swedish desert. 100% it’ll be done for RRR’s July edition and a Dissection will happen prior to that. I could have forced myself to rush through it, but I don’t think *Elantris* deserves that.\n\nI also, as mentioned before, got *The Book That Wouldn’t Burn* and was determined to have it finished before June ended, but I feel like…that book is *also* meant to be treated as a chonker, if that makes sense? No?\n\nWhat I mean is, I don’t think I should rush that book in 5 days like I usually do with my weekday reads. It feels like it’s meant to be taken at a slower pace?... So, as much as I didn’t want it to, it’ll be treated as my chonker book of the month and I’ll get it done by July’s end. Hopefully. Cough.\n\nCurious, do you guys treat summer months as a time to read chonker books? (600+ pages) Not sure why, I just associate summer with reading UNIT books, but not as a winter activity, even though that’s also the time to read.\n\nEither way, what are you guys reading for July or looking forward to anything? Would love to see if I can add it to my rotation!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Answers**: \\~\n\nNettle & Bone: >!3.9/5!<\n\nThe Fifth Season: >!2.5/5!<\n\nRestaurant: >!4/5!<\n\nIlluminations: >!4/5!<\n\nTales: >!4/5!<\n\nIf you have any constructive feedback, I’m open to them!

Went back to good ol’ Texas to burn myself in triple digit heat for 2 and a half months and gorging on curry. However, this also took a nose dive for my book reading….All the while, I was juggling 2 cats in cabin for nearly 20 hours to make sure they didn’t claw the stewards. (My children are extremely happy here because they run around and demand food to their hearts content from their favorite uncle).\n\nJune was a time of remembrance of Junteenth, CEOs being shady (nothing new there), and for 18 hours, the world collectively held their breath.\n\nIn book news, my Kindle is in the equivalent of cryogenic sleep, aka, the Libby hold trick. Basically, I have my Kindle in airplane mode so I can keep a book longer, without affecting the person ahead of me in the waiting list.\n\nFor example, if I wanted to read *Labyrinths* by Borges for longer than 2 weeks, I would put my Kindle in airplane mode, so the next person can get their copy without delay.\n\n…What this means is, I have *The Book That Wouldn’t Burn* in said cryogenic slumber. This also means…all the books I need to read for July are *not in my Kindle. I didn’t plan ahead at all when I found out about this*…yeah, I’m in a bit of a pickle…\n\nOn the bright side, *Gods of the Wyrdwood* came out though!

Sweden is the middle child, and Finland is the older brother you hang out with on lone holidays drinking vodka and petting their dog)!<\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***Illuminations***](https://www.amazon.com/Illuminations-T-Kingfisher-ebook/dp/B0BN44VJ1T/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=illuminations+t+kingfisher&qid=1688151214&sprefix=illuminations+t%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-1) **by T. Kingfisher:**\n\nRead if you ever feel like no one appreciates your art and want to read about a world where good art is everything.\n\nLiterally.\n\nYou know how coding is the foundation for this world? Imagine that, but art via illuminations.\n\nThis is a book for age ranges of 10-14 years old, but obviously, anyone can read it. If you truly believe you’re an adult at heart, you already don’t know how to live life. Go out and experience something new.\n\nDid I slam the keyboard? Go.\n\nDeborah, experiencing a golden latte is not- you know what? Enjoy it.\n\nThere is a mishmash of certain tropes into a new one and then the usual tropes of Oops! All Parents are Dead! that you’re not sure everyone likes.\n\nYou’ll also read, probably, one of the most epic climactic battles you’ve seen of a YA book. We’ve had *A Wizard’s Guide* where you didn’t think Kingfisher could top it, but because stakes are a little less so, she somehow one ups herself with fighting an angry mandrake that, somehow, is better than most adult fantasy climactic battles you’ve read.\n\nYeah, you’re not sure how it led to this either.\n\n**Ö** Theme: Tumult Crest of a Violent Wave (Arranged Ver.) Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPYnC1j4LpM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPYnC1j4LpM)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[***Tales of Lunis Aquaria***](https://www.amazon.com/Tales-Lunis-Aquaria-Tessa-Hastjarjanto-ebook/dp/B07NNRCCCR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2R0CVM0U1BMOS&keywords=tales+of+lunis+aquaria&qid=1688151236&sprefix=tales+of+lunis+aquari%2Caps%2C121&sr=8-1) **by Tessa Hastjarjanto:**\n\nRead if you need to take a break from dark fantasy or in general, bleach for your brain (and possibly your wallet), by reading a short story collection of a mythical place called the OG Library of Alexandria.\n\nI mean, Lunis Aquaria.\n\nYou’re not going to find a lot of overarching cohesion together, but each story can be seen as a stand alone and at least one depressing shit going down. Kind of like an Ikea on a Saturday.\n\nYou should see these as original fairy tales, and not “short stories”, if that makes sense?\n\nCharacters are about as one dimensional as two-ply toilet paper, but Hastjarjanto makes up for it by making it short and inserting as many fantasy elements as she can possibly think of. Because you read *Fifth Season* recently, you’re not sure how Jemisin didn’t think of making stone people become vampires. That’s actually genius.\n\nYou also find yourself crying over characters of said two-ply toilet paper that you’re not sure how to process these emotions and then the last short story made you want to shake MCs like, how are you *that* dumb?!\n\nThen you decide to try moonshine while reading the stories and it helped *wash* away your sorrows. And then being disappointed that this wasn’t the strongest alcohol you’ve ever tried, and you can only go higher from here.\n\n**Ö** Theme: Hollow Knight OST – Greenpath: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWquuWkHVP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWquuWkHVP4)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Conclusion**: @\n\nYou may wonder, “Lady, where the fuck is the *Elantris* review?!”… and I’ll tell you, “BITCH, JET LAG!”\n\nI’m having so much fun reading *Elantris* that it’s like getting an agua fresca after being parched in a Swedish desert. 100% it’ll be done for RRR’s July edition and a Dissection will happen prior to that. I could have forced myself to rush through it, but I don’t think *Elantris* deserves that.\n\nI also, as mentioned before, got *The Book That Wouldn’t Burn* and was determined to have it finished before June ended, but I feel like…that book is *also* meant to be treated as a chonker, if that makes sense? No?\n\nWhat I mean is, I don’t think I should rush that book in 5 days like I usually do with my weekday reads. It feels like it’s meant to be taken at a slower pace?... So, as much as I didn’t want it to, it’ll be treated as my chonker book of the month and I’ll get it done by July’s end. Hopefully. Cough.\n\nCurious, do you guys treat summer months as a time to read chonker books? (600+ pages) Not sure why, I just associate summer with reading UNIT books, but not as a winter activity, even though that’s also the time to read.\n\nEither way, what are you guys reading for July or looking forward to anything? Would love to see if I can add it to my rotation!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Answers**: \\~\n\nNettle & Bone: >!3.9/5!<\n\nThe Fifth Season: >!2.5/5!<\n\nRestaurant: >!4/5!<\n\nIlluminations: >!4/5!<\n\nTales: >!4/5!<\n\nIf you have any constructive feedback, I’m open to them!

Anyway I thought the actress playing Ciri was older than she was. When I see Yen and Ciri on screen as a mother-figure and young(?) daughter it looks awkward to me and I wondered if anyone else noticed how Yen looks younger than Ciri. Maybe is it was more like Yen being a sister figure or something itd be less silly to me? What I'm saying its just kinda cringey. I'm also new to the franchise so what do I know",

        "title": "My Good/Bad/Ugly of S3 so far",
        "body": "I should start out by saying I've been critical of Netflix's Witcher for a while now, even including S1, and after the utter disaster that was S2, I wasn't expecting some immediate 180 to lore accuracy. And in fairness, there wasn't one, but this was closer than the other two seasons, and I definitely enjoyed this season more than the others. Here's my take:\n\n**The Good**\n\n* family time- it was so refreshing to finally have some moments with the three of them together, and ones that did not include \"mom\" trying to sacrifice \"daughter\". My biggest complaint with both the books and games is there wasn't enough of this, so I really appreciated those moments\n* Cassie Clare- she was the casting I've been most excited about and I have to say I really liked her take of Philippa. Her disdain and self-righteous attitude is perfect. I think it was pure Phil when she was talking to Yennefer in the end and Yennefer obviously has no clue of which way the winds are actually turning.\n* the pettiness of the sorceresses- I really liked how stupid and petty these women were. The bath scene where Ciri storms out of did a good job showing that, and laying some good groundwork on the type of women who will be in the Lodge.\n* Shaerrawedd- this whole scene was great, especially the fighting, and I liked Yennefer throwing Francesca back like that while telling her Ciri is hers.\n* Geralt's \"I love you\"- Henry did a great job with this little line. You can see that man is a Team Yen, and I definitely am here for it. I just wish Yennefer would have said it back.\n* The weirdness of the portals- I liked the hints of the fact that these portals are strange, that there's a darkness to them they cannot place or understand.\n* Codringher and Fenn- they were probably my favorite part of S2 and I quite liked them here.\n* Triss- We never did know what Triss was up to in the books between Geralt leaving her after the caravan to take Ciri to Ellander and the Banquet. I think her working with the students, also as a way to hide from her own PTSD and failings to help Ciri in S2, makes a lot of sense. And I can understand her dedication to find the missing students\n* No use of Firefucker- It's Rience, thank God.\n\n**The Bad**\n\n* Yennefer's betrayal- This felt too glossed over to me, like we as an audience are supposed to accept that time heals all wounds. Perhaps it does, but she still needed scenes were we can truly see how desperate she was to do that. We needed her to explain what it was like to have VM in your head like that, the eroding of her will, all of it, to make her decision make sense and the healing to really begin. This was just too rushed.\n* Francesca and the Elves- This felt pointless. Sure, I understand their desperation, but Francesca's willingness to continually sacrifice elven lives makes zero sense. We don't spend enough time with her to understand her deeper motives beyond \"elder blood\" and \"need Ciri\". And even so, that doesn't justify wasting lives of a population that literally cannot repopulate itself, which was the primary goal in S2.\n* Emhyr- this would probably be more neutral, but the buddy-buddy relationship he displays with Cahir seems...off. I tried to debate if it was the games that are just tainting my expectation (Charles Dance was amazing as Emhyr), but I can't recall Emhyr in the books acting all comrades-in-arms either. He ruled by intimidation, suppression, and utter reverence. I didn't feel that as much here. I did like Cahir attacking his own image in the mirror after her killed Gallatin in cold blood though.\n* Triss and Istredd- did anyone else pick up on a budding relationship here? Was it just me?\n* Radovid- regardless of his sanity, the man is still meant to be a ruthless strategist. This version isn't giving me that at all. He's just some floppy-haired playboy living off the royal teat.\n\n**The Ugly**\n\n* That body monster- like seriously, wtf? The monster and the heads make zero sense anyway, since it's not elven blood but ELDER blood that is needed. So why would >!Vilgefortz!< be wasting any time with half-elven mages?\n* Fringilla's arc- she has been utterly pointless this season. Now she's an alcoholic barmaid?\n* Jaskier and Radovid- This just screams pandering to me. And why, of all people, Radovid?!\n* Mistle's inclusion- Yes, I know they are doing a spin-off, but the last thing we need is Ciri believing Mistle saved her by throwing her that knife, which then justifies some \"good\" in Mistle. I knew this show would make her a Robin Hood figure, and that's exactly what they are doing.\n* \"Things are not...as they seem\"- WE GET IT!!!!!\n\n**Pure Rage**\n\n* Yen- It's Yennefer, Yenna, or Mistress Yennefer to EVERYONE BUT GERALT!!!! He's the only one who calls her Yen. Why is this so hard to understand??!! Looking at you too, CDPR.\n\nThat's probably enough. All in all, I went in expecting nothing, and so was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.",

        "body": "I have no idea where the show deviates from the source material, but I know there's a lot of controversy about just that. However, with nothing to compare it to I've mostly enjoyed it so far. \n\nBut this last episode at Arituza was just a drag. By now I wanted to see Ciri realize what a bad ass she is, or for there to be an epic confrontation between the goodies and baddies... But I was quite literally bored. \n\nWhat is the point of deviating from the source material if they're not gonna at least tell a compelling story? There's so few episodes per season that none of it should be filler. Let's get to the point already!\n\nI'm also thinking they missed the mark with the elves. I know there's even a book with Elves in the title, and Ciri having Elder blood is a big deal.... But like somehow I'm not invested in the Elves. They seem an afterthought that has little bearing on the story. I forget there are Elves in the story and when Triss uncovers the targeting on elf mages, I'm like what? Are people discriminating against elves? Oh yeah, that's like a theme or something...\n\nThey shouldn't reimagine the story if they can't do it clearly and compellingly. This season has really highlighted the weak storytelling for me and I can't imagine how bad it's been for game/book fans. No wonder Henry is leaving, I'm finding myself wondering why I liked this show so much. I'm quite sad at how disappointed I am.",

        "body": "Just finished watching part 1 of season 3, and it just seems overall of a much poorer quality than the last two seasons.\n\n* The dialogue is rushed, the editing is sloppy\n* The visual effects for instance - the first scene where Geralt cuts down the bounty hunters - such obviously fake blood on screen\n* Characters have become poorly defined, or losing definition - Jen treats Ciri terribly with her fellow witches while offering Ciri no chance to transition, Djikistra is easily fooled by Radovid, despite being a spy master, and having been reasonably effective in the last season. Stregobor offers himself up for trial with an unnecessary throwaway line\n* Radovid himself is constantly referred to as someone who is way more intelligent, yet not much has been on show to prove that point\n\nI agree with a lot of people that Henry Cavill seems perfect for this role, but perhaps he has jumped ship at the right time. Probably only going to get worse from here.\n\n&#x200B;",

Does it exist in a different dimension in their heads?\n\nIts so weird and out of the blue the things they do with the story.\n\nCould anyone explain what they hope to accomplish with this?

Unfortunately, I find that female leads / go-leads in fantasy books are often badly portrayed. « Strong women » often equal entitled/bitchy characters (cue Yennefer in the Witcher - at least the TV show, I admit to not having read the books) and/or have to be this super-beautiful-hot (generally also badass and sexually liberated) girl that every man in the book desires (cue Denna in the Kingkiller Chronicle)… Both are equally annoying. I like smart, strong but grounded and overall more « credible » characters such as Hermione in Harry Potter, or Vin in Mistborn (in fact, I love women in Sanderson’s novels generally)… Any recommendations of books I might like ?\n\nEdit: a really big thank you for all the recommandations !

I enjoyed this season but every time they start talking politics.. it feels like some cheap highschool conspiracies.. ThE wAr iS c0miNg they say.. oh such a big words. But where? Where are the armies? Preparations? I remember bits from books.. Northern kings meeting. Foltest/someone ordered to cut down trees, make boats and blitzkrieg through Yaruga to reconquer Cintra before Nilfgaard can react. Common folk unhappy with wood price. Price of the wood skyrocketed they say..\n\n>!Oh look at me I'm Sapkowski, I can talk economy cuz.. I studied economy. Good thing he used his knowledge during talks with CDPR btw XD oh enough back to topic now!<\n\nThere were preparation. Northern Kingdoms wanted to stage a false flag attack and blame Nilfgaard for braking truce. The war.. really was coming.. Nilfgaard learn things. Brotherhood wants to stop this mess and decides to host a big party. Aplegatt never delivered the message and Nilfgaard >!blitzkreig-ed through Aedirn instead.!< At least that's how I remember things, I might be completely wrong here.\n\nWhat I want to say.. where is all this in the show? They had time for Voleith Meir... almost half of season 2. They had time for Jaskier-Radovid stuff which could be almost completely cut out. They had time for catastrophic spin off.. and apparently they are working on another one now.. Plus they act like half the stuff never happened. Its like the showrunner read the books but the politics were too much for her and she decided to throw it out of the window.\n\nSecond and 3rd seasons are like: Yennefer is bad, Stregobor is good. Great. Oh.. but he has a secret safe in his room! Yennefer is good. Stregobor is bad. What will they do next? Will they take Stregobor's iPhone and start reading his messages? Jeezzz they are a few hundred years old people.. can they.. act that way? Please?\n\n\"There is not enough action in first book\", \"They had to invent a villain\" but, but but.. a lot of action in this season (Shaerrawedd ambush, Geralt-Rience fight, Aeschna) actually is from the first novel. Now they have to speedrun through the 2nd one... Quite unnecessarily...",

        "body": "So what's going on with the timeline here? Did everything that happened in The Witcher, that happened to Geralt, happen prior to the fall of the kingdom? They're showing two separate timelines here it seems. Because we see the fall of that Kingdom and episode one or two. And then random bits of Ciri later on, then her being in this mystical words with magical water? Having a drink it become part of the woods or whatever I don't know.\n\n I'm only on this episode now. But she was told to find The Geralt of Rivia before her escape. But simultaneously she had met him earlier? Or at least was in his presence at this party. Or it starts out with the queen coming in covered in blood, the same queen that died and episode 1 or 2. So if it's someone explain to me why they're having multiple timelines going on here or tell me that I'm just completely confused? Because it definitely seem to be Ciri. They refer to the Queen that came in covered in blood as her grandmother. The same guy that seems like a womanizing jokester name starts with an e like Ein something. Who also died on the battle against nilfgaard(sp?)\n\nThey also show the queen making major jokes about nilfgaard, saying they drink their own piss or something like that. Making a fool of the current king saying that you would soon die or be usurped.",

Warning that I may include some possible book spoilers here and there to the \"equivalent\" scenes in the books. Because its a different story, if you might want to read it you might get spoilers here.\n\nLets go!\n\n. The professor was a hired killer after Geralt, not after Ciri. And he was actually a competent swordsman in the books, a famous one.\n\n(correction: The professor was following Yennefer on the road and Geralt got to know about him when talking to Codringer and Fenn. After which he proceeded to intercept)\n\n. Geralt + Yen + Ciri never really get the chance to live together in the books. Sad I know.\n\n. Geralt + Yen were estranged at this point in time in the books but for completely different reasons. They had spent a couple years without contact with each other in the books and would reunite only just before the big mage council.\n\n. Neither Geralt or Yennefer ever had stupid plans to use Ciri as bait to attract whoever or whatever. At this point in the book story, Rience had no clue where Ciri was. Because Yennefer was actually a competent guardian in the books and could keep Ciri out of trouble.\n\n. There was no need for Yen and Ciri to reconcile in the books because the entire Deathless Mother plot never happened and Yen never betrayed Ciri.\n\n. Yen did write a letter to Geralt but it was actually answering him. And his letter was a bit earlier in the story and where he actually asked Yen to go help with Ciri. Book Yen was quite pissed at Geralt at the time but mainly because of him having called Triss to Kaer Morhen first lol Apparently show Yennefer does not care about that but book Yen sure did ;) The entire romantic triangle between Geralt + Triss + Yen remains absent from the series.\n\n. Radovid was not the kings brother in the books but the kings son and heir. He was also fairly younger and had no interaction with a certain bard. Nowhere in the books does it say he was gay. But he did have Phillipa as one of his tutors.\n\n. Phillipa by the way was part of the Northern Brotherhood of Mages. She was pretty high ranking member and was also Tissaia´s best student ever in the books.\n\n. Which brings the point that Yennefer was not a fugitive in the books and was also a high ranking member of the Brotherhood. Same rank as Phillipa.\n\n. Francesca was also an even higher ranking member, same rank as Tissaia. She was not leading any rag tag rebel elven army at this point in the story. She was still acting as a Northern Mage up till the big Mage council.\n\n. Enough to say that Francesca never attacked Geralt + Ciri in the books. Neither did Rience as a fact. Geralt + Ciri were indeed attacked by elves in the books, a bit earlier in the story. But those elves were not yet directly linked with Francesca. And they did not even know a thing about Ciri. Triss was actually there with both Geralt and Ciri. Yarpen was there too, that part was correct. But the bard was not.\n\n. The entire elven plot in the series is obviously not the book plot so far\n\n. The entire plot with the bard and Radovid was obviously not the book plot at all\n\n. There were no weird experiences with young sorcerers in the books. That plot is also entirely fan fiction. There was a plot to create a \"fake Ciri\" which ended up being established by the weird guys Geralt kind of visited in the series. But that book plot was just about picking a peasant girl and educating her so that she could pass for Ciri. Which in turn would allow real Ciri to go more incognito.\n\n (add on: What did exist in the books was a plot where Vilgefortz was kidnaping random normal girls. He was conducting pretty gross experiences with them. But they were not being turned into monsters. Sadly, their end was plain and simple death. Vilgefortz was a very dangerous psycho in the books) \n\n. Triss obviously had no involvement with searching around for what was happening with young sorcerers. That is all fan fiction\n\n. Tissaia was not in a relationship with Vilgefortz in the books. She actually distrusted him a bit. Not much but she had some spider sense going out about him.\n\n. Stregobor was only a character in 1 short story. Everything with him in the series after Renfri is fan fiction\n\n. Istredd was also only present in one short story. Everything with him in the series is fan fiction. Well...he did have a relationship with Yennefer in the books...lets give them that one.\n\n. Geralt and Yen did attend Belleteyn in the books but Ciri was not there. This actually happened slightly before the fall of Cintra. And at this book meeting Yennefer actually told Geralt to go save Ciri because war was likely going to start soon.\n\n. Yennefer did not organize the big mage meeting in the books. Vilgefortz did! Yennefer was pretty much \"in hiding\" with Ciri and would not be stupid to call everyone´s attention towards her. However, because she was a high ranking member in the books, she was invited and had to go. Which in the books effectively ended up flushing her out of \"hiding\".\n\n. Yennefer did not want to unite everyone against Nilfgaard in the books. She was actually one of the few pacifist mages who wanted to avoid any kind of confrontation as much as possible. It was in fact Phillipa who was rallying every anti-Nilfgaard mage in the books.\n\n. Yennefer actually run after Ciri when she escaped from her, Tissaia and Rita. The entire dynamics between them all were different in the books. Ciri very much wanted to escape because she had recent knowledge that Geralt happened to be nearby. So Ciri really really wanted to go see Geralt. And she did. And Yen followed her. And this was actually what prompted Yen + Geralt reuniting in the books. In the books it was Yen who lead the charge against the Wild Hunt.\n\n. Keira Metz was not some random street mage. She was actually royal advisor and Secret Service leader.\n\n. Rita and Tissaia were only aggressive towards Ciri up till Yen showed up and explained what was going on. From there on, they were pretty positive and wanted to help Ciri as possible. Yennefer´s plan in the books was to get Ciri under Rita´s protection at Aretuza. And Rita even offered to get Ciri into a more advanced class if she might like it better.\n\n. Ciri did not travel by boat anywhere in the books. She also did not kill any sea monster. Geralt actually did it alone. The bard was not there either. Book Geralt would be very unlikely to ever let Ciri face a monster 1 vs 1. He would not willingly let Ciri near any monster to be true about it.\n\n. Cahir was NEVER a bad guy in the books. So almost all he does in the series is some weird acid dream. He will start having visions with Ciri in the books but....what can I say....lets just say the content of those visions did not sound anywhere like what we see in the series lol Lets say that instead of, again, weird acid dreams...it was more like Cahir´s happy hour lol\n\n. Fringilla was actually a noble from Toussaint which was a Nilfgaardian autonomous duchy. She was never imprisoned in the books. Almost all she does in the series is a weird acid dream. She was a mage and she did fight at Sodden and that´s pretty much what´s accurate about her.\n\nSo that people do not say I am only negative....what was fairly book accurate?\n\n. Ciri did kill the small monster in town. She did walk around with a young guy. Those scenes were almost accurate (apart from some weird geographic issues...they could actually see Thanedd island from the walls of the city and did not need to watch a weird painting of it).\n\n(add on: The girl who have a knife to Ciri in the series was not there in the books. She is a character that Ciri will meet in future book plots but in a total different place. And its going to be a gigantic plot hole if Ciri actually recognizes her and knows that she has been in the North. It will very much destroy an entire future plot where Ciri is supposed to be completely lost and with no possible way home)\n\n. Ciri and the bard did witness Geralt + Yennefer´s reunion. Which was really their important reunion after a couple years apart in the books. Jaskier did some narration. The dialogues were different and more serious in the books.\n\n. Yennefer and Geralt did attend the big mage meeting together. Dialogues between everyone were somewhat different in the books. Which is obvious because Stregobor and Istredd are not book characters at this point and the entire factions at play are somewhat different in the books. Francesca was present at the meeting too, mostly side by side with Tissaia.\n\n. Yennefer and Geralt did have sex after the meeting. This one was likely the most book accurate scene in the entire Season :) Ohh no....wait....in the books Geralt was the one who did wake up and leave the room. Yen stayed sleeping. He did not wake her up. And he just woke up because he needed to go pee lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Francesca was also an even higher ranking member, same rank as Tissaia. She was not leading any rag tag rebel elven army at this point in the story. She was still acting as a Northern Mage up till the big Mage council.\n\n. Enough to say that Francesca never attacked Geralt + Ciri in the books. Neither did Rience as a fact. Geralt + Ciri were indeed attacked by elves in the books, a bit earlier in the story. But those elves were not yet directly linked with Francesca. And they did not even know a thing about Ciri. Triss was actually there with both Geralt and Ciri. Yarpen was there too, that part was correct. But the bard was not.\n\n. The entire elven plot in the series is obviously not the book plot so far\n\n. The entire plot with the bard and Radovid was obviously not the book plot at all\n\n. There were no weird experiences with young sorcerers in the books. That plot is also entirely fan fiction. There was a plot to create a \"fake Ciri\" which ended up being established by the weird guys Geralt kind of visited in the series. But that book plot was just about picking a peasant girl and educating her so that she could pass for Ciri. Which in turn would allow real Ciri to go more incognito.\n\n (add on: What did exist in the books was a plot where Vilgefortz was kidnaping random normal girls. He was conducting pretty gross experiences with them. But they were not being turned into monsters. Sadly, their end was plain and simple death. Vilgefortz was a very dangerous psycho in the books) \n\n. Triss obviously had no involvement with searching around for what was happening with young sorcerers. That is all fan fiction\n\n. Tissaia was not in a relationship with Vilgefortz in the books. She actually distrusted him a bit. Not much but she had some spider sense going out about him.\n\n. Stregobor was only a character in 1 short story. Everything with him in the series after Renfri is fan fiction\n\n. Istredd was also only present in one short story. Everything with him in the series is fan fiction. Well...he did have a relationship with Yennefer in the books...lets give them that one.\n\n. Geralt and Yen did attend Belleteyn in the books but Ciri was not there. This actually happened slightly before the fall of Cintra. And at this book meeting Yennefer actually told Geralt to go save Ciri because war was likely going to start soon.\n\n. Yennefer did not organize the big mage meeting in the books. Vilgefortz did! Yennefer was pretty much \"in hiding\" with Ciri and would not be stupid to call everyone´s attention towards her. However, because she was a high ranking member in the books, she was invited and had to go. Which in the books effectively ended up flushing her out of \"hiding\".\n\n. Yennefer did not want to unite everyone against Nilfgaard in the books. She was actually one of the few pacifist mages who wanted to avoid any kind of confrontation as much as possible. It was in fact Phillipa who was rallying every anti-Nilfgaard mage in the books.\n\n. Yennefer actually run after Ciri when she escaped from her, Tissaia and Rita. The entire dynamics between them all were different in the books. Ciri very much wanted to escape because she had recent knowledge that Geralt happened to be nearby. So Ciri really really wanted to go see Geralt. And she did. And Yen followed her. And this was actually what prompted Yen + Geralt reuniting in the books. In the books it was Yen who lead the charge against the Wild Hunt.\n\n. Keira Metz was not some random street mage. She was actually royal advisor and Secret Service leader.\n\n. Rita and Tissaia were only aggressive towards Ciri up till Yen showed up and explained what was going on. From there on, they were pretty positive and wanted to help Ciri as possible. Yennefer´s plan in the books was to get Ciri under Rita´s protection at Aretuza. And Rita even offered to get Ciri into a more advanced class if she might like it better.\n\n. Ciri did not travel by boat anywhere in the books. She also did not kill any sea monster. Geralt actually did it alone. The bard was not there either. Book Geralt would be very unlikely to ever let Ciri face a monster 1 vs 1. He would not willingly let Ciri near any monster to be true about it.\n\n. Cahir was NEVER a bad guy in the books. So almost all he does in the series is some weird acid dream. He will start having visions with Ciri in the books but....what can I say....lets just say the content of those visions did not sound anywhere like what we see in the series lol Lets say that instead of, again, weird acid dreams...it was more like Cahir´s happy hour lol\n\n. Fringilla was actually a noble from Toussaint which was a Nilfgaardian autonomous duchy. She was never imprisoned in the books. Almost all she does in the series is a weird acid dream. She was a mage and she did fight at Sodden and that´s pretty much what´s accurate about her.\n\nSo that people do not say I am only negative....what was fairly book accurate?\n\n. Ciri did kill the small monster in town. She did walk around with a young guy. Those scenes were almost accurate (apart from some weird geographic issues...they could actually see Thanedd island from the walls of the city and did not need to watch a weird painting of it).\n\n(add on: The girl who have a knife to Ciri in the series was not there in the books. She is a character that Ciri will meet in future book plots but in a total different place. And its going to be a gigantic plot hole if Ciri actually recognizes her and knows that she has been in the North. It will very much destroy an entire future plot where Ciri is supposed to be completely lost and with no possible way home)\n\n. Ciri and the bard did witness Geralt + Yennefer´s reunion. Which was really their important reunion after a couple years apart in the books. Jaskier did some narration. The dialogues were different and more serious in the books.\n\n. Yennefer and Geralt did attend the big mage meeting together. Dialogues between everyone were somewhat different in the books. Which is obvious because Stregobor and Istredd are not book characters at this point and the entire factions at play are somewhat different in the books. Francesca was present at the meeting too, mostly side by side with Tissaia.\n\n. Yennefer and Geralt did have sex after the meeting. This one was likely the most book accurate scene in the entire Season :) Ohh no....wait....in the books Geralt was the one who did wake up and leave the room. Yen stayed sleeping. He did not wake her up. And he just woke up because he needed to go pee lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Radovid was not the kings brother in the books but the kings son and heir. He was also fairly younger and had no interaction with a certain bard. Nowhere in the books does it say he was gay. But he did have Phillipa as one of his tutors.\n\n. Phillipa by the way was part of the Northern Brotherhood of Mages. She was pretty high ranking member and was also Tissaia´s best student ever in the books.\n\n. Which brings the point that Yennefer was not a fugitive in the books and was also a high ranking member of the Brotherhood. Same rank as Phillipa.\n\n. Francesca was also an even higher ranking member, same rank as Tissaia. She was not leading any rag tag rebel elven army at this point in the story. She was still acting as a Northern Mage up till the big Mage council.\n\n. Enough to say that Francesca never attacked Geralt + Ciri in the books. Neither did Rience as a fact. Geralt + Ciri were indeed attacked by elves in the books, a bit earlier in the story. But those elves were not yet directly linked with Francesca. And they did not even know a thing about Ciri. Triss was actually there with both Geralt and Ciri. Yarpen was there too, that part was correct. But the bard was not.\n\n. The entire elven plot in the series is obviously not the book plot so far\n\n. The entire plot with the bard and Radovid was obviously not the book plot at all\n\n. There were no weird experiences with young sorcerers in the books. That plot is also entirely fan fiction. There was a plot to create a \"fake Ciri\" which ended up being established by the weird guys Geralt kind of visited in the series. But that book plot was just about picking a peasant girl and educating her so that she could pass for Ciri. Which in turn would allow real Ciri to go more incognito.\n\n (add on: What did exist in the books was a plot where Vilgefortz was kidnaping random normal girls. He was conducting pretty gross experiences with them. But they were not being turned into monsters. Sadly, their end was plain and simple death. Vilgefortz was a very dangerous psycho in the books) \n\n. Triss obviously had no involvement with searching around for what was happening with young sorcerers. That is all fan fiction\n\n. Tissaia was not in a relationship with Vilgefortz in the books. She actually distrusted him a bit. Not much but she had some spider sense going out about him.\n\n. Stregobor was only a character in 1 short story. Everything with him in the series after Renfri is fan fiction\n\n. Istredd was also only present in one short story. Everything with him in the series is fan fiction. Well...he did have a relationship with Yennefer in the books...lets give them that one.\n\n. Geralt and Yen did attend Belleteyn in the books but Ciri was not there. This actually happened slightly before the fall of Cintra. And at this book meeting Yennefer actually told Geralt to go save Ciri because war was likely going to start soon.\n\n. Yennefer did not organize the big mage meeting in the books. Vilgefortz did! Yennefer was pretty much \"in hiding\" with Ciri and would not be stupid to call everyone´s attention towards her. However, because she was a high ranking member in the books, she was invited and had to go. Which in the books effectively ended up flushing her out of \"hiding\".\n\n. Yennefer did not want to unite everyone against Nilfgaard in the books. She was actually one of the few pacifist mages who wanted to avoid any kind of confrontation as much as possible. It was in fact Phillipa who was rallying every anti-Nilfgaard mage in the books.\n\n. Yennefer actually run after Ciri when she escaped from her, Tissaia and Rita. The entire dynamics between them all were different in the books. Ciri very much wanted to escape because she had recent knowledge that Geralt happened to be nearby. So Ciri really really wanted to go see Geralt. And she did. And Yen followed her. And this was actually what prompted Yen + Geralt reuniting in the books. In the books it was Yen who lead the charge against the Wild Hunt.\n\n. Keira Metz was not some random street mage. She was actually royal advisor and Secret Service leader.\n\n. Rita and Tissaia were only aggressive towards Ciri up till Yen showed up and explained what was going on. From there on, they were pretty positive and wanted to help Ciri as possible. Yennefer´s plan in the books was to get Ciri under Rita´s protection at Aretuza. And Rita even offered to get Ciri into a more advanced class if she might like it better.\n\n. Ciri did not travel by boat anywhere in the books. She also did not kill any sea monster. Geralt actually did it alone. The bard was not there either. Book Geralt would be very unlikely to ever let Ciri face a monster 1 vs 1. He would not willingly let Ciri near any monster to be true about it.\n\n. Cahir was NEVER a bad guy in the books. So almost all he does in the series is some weird acid dream. He will start having visions with Ciri in the books but....what can I say....lets just say the content of those visions did not sound anywhere like what we see in the series lol Lets say that instead of, again, weird acid dreams...it was more like Cahir´s happy hour lol\n\n. Fringilla was actually a noble from Toussaint which was a Nilfgaardian autonomous duchy. She was never imprisoned in the books. Almost all she does in the series is a weird acid dream. She was a mage and she did fight at Sodden and that´s pretty much what´s accurate about her.\n\nSo that people do not say I am only negative....what was fairly book accurate?\n\n. Ciri did kill the small monster in town. She did walk around with a young guy. Those scenes were almost accurate (apart from some weird geographic issues...they could actually see Thanedd island from the walls of the city and did not need to watch a weird painting of it).\n\n(add on: The girl who have a knife to Ciri in the series was not there in the books. She is a character that Ciri will meet in future book plots but in a total different place. And its going to be a gigantic plot hole if Ciri actually recognizes her and knows that she has been in the North. It will very much destroy an entire future plot where Ciri is supposed to be completely lost and with no possible way home)\n\n. Ciri and the bard did witness Geralt + Yennefer´s reunion. Which was really their important reunion after a couple years apart in the books. Jaskier did some narration. The dialogues were different and more serious in the books.\n\n. Yennefer and Geralt did attend the big mage meeting together. Dialogues between everyone were somewhat different in the books. Which is obvious because Stregobor and Istredd are not book characters at this point and the entire factions at play are somewhat different in the books. Francesca was present at the meeting too, mostly side by side with Tissaia.\n\n. Yennefer and Geralt did have sex after the meeting. This one was likely the most book accurate scene in the entire Season :) Ohh no....wait....in the books Geralt was the one who did wake up and leave the room. Yen stayed sleeping. He did not wake her up. And he just woke up because he needed to go pee lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

And he was actually a competent swordsman in the books, a famous one.\n\n(correction: The professor was following Yennefer on the road and Geralt got to know about him when talking to Codringer and Fenn. After which he proceeded to intercept)\n\n. Geralt + Yen + Ciri never really get the chance to live together in the books. Sad I know.\n\n. Geralt + Yen were estranged at this point in time in the books but for completely different reasons. They had spent a couple years without contact with each other in the books and would reunite only just before the big mage council.\n\n. Neither Geralt or Yennefer ever had stupid plans to use Ciri as bait to attract whoever or whatever. At this point in the book story, Rience had no clue where Ciri was. Because Yennefer was actually a competent guardian in the books and could keep Ciri out of trouble.\n\n. There was no need for Yen and Ciri to reconcile in the books because the entire Deathless Mother plot never happened and Yen never betrayed Ciri.\n\n. Yen did write a letter to Geralt but it was actually answering him. And his letter was a bit earlier in the story and where he actually asked Yen to go help with Ciri.

I shook my head at Maddy turning down the $8,000 and Alex turning down the traitors invitation because they wanted to continue their friendship with the faithfuls! Massive spoiler: I liked Aaron and didn't think he'd make it to the end, but I like him winning with Hannah and Meryl!<\r  \n\r  \n**The Traitors AUS** \\- This version was so, so chaotic! 🤣🤣 The traitors throughout were always throwing each other under the bus, unlike the UK version, they weren't there to make friends!\r  \nI could not stand >!Marielle, and the episode of her banishment was one of the best episodes of reality TV, I had to watch it twice! The part where Kate realizes in real time Marielle is lying to her, and then how they all decide to not say anything at the table and just vote her out, \\*chef's kiss!\\* Alex and Kate played the game brilliantly. Massive spoiler: I liked Alex winning but I wish both of them had split it!<\r  \n\r  \n**The Traitors US** \\- The UK and AUS versions were superior, but this version was extremely watchable. The reality stars (ex. Kate and Rachel, among others) were nasty and spiteful towards each other. I found >!Christian to be irksome, but with the US version, it felt like there was camaraderie among the traitors (at first). We actually saw the traitors collaborate on who they would be voting for, even while voting each other out, like with Cirie and Christian voting Cody out, and then Cirie and Arie voting Christian out.

That's ridiculous and not how magic works in witcher. You are a sorceress or you're not, and you either know how a cast and spell and have enough power for it or you don't. You don't just buy it. Even if you go by show standards where she lost her magic for a while, her magic has clearly returned now. \n\nIn season 1 we have seen her open tones of portals on her own, multiple in a row in fact. And in episode 1 of this very season we see her be able to keep Rience's special portal open too because she's powerful, and she kills that guy with a flick of a wrist. So why would she suddenly need to \"buy a portal\" instead of just opening one to Aretuza herself? Makes no sense and contradicts itself...\n\nAlso if that is suppose to be the actual Kiera METZ than lol. they made her look like some foul mouthed commoner, not a former advisor to King Foltest.",

        "body": "Short disclaimer - social media can be unpleasant enough as is, and I'm a bit too old to be a hater. Also, it will be very hard not to make what I'm about to write sound elitist. The Witcher may be the only piece of fiction I feel so strongly about, so maybe it is, in fact, a bit elitist, but gatekeeping is not my intention. In fact, my main intention is the exact opposite - I wish as many people as possible could experience this story in all its glory.\n\nI really love The Witcher. I've read the series back in high school - almost two decades ago at this point - and it blew my mind. Additional readings as an adult convinced me that \"Wiedźmin\", is one of those rare examples of stories, that are deep enough to leave an impression lasting a lifetime.\n\nThe first episode of the third season of the Netflix show really bummed me out. Not because it was terrible - it even had some strong points (mostly performances), but because making a story so rich, smart, subtle, deep and elegant, into a passable 6/10 entertainment, is likely worse than not making it at all.\n\nTo be clear, to me \"staying faithful to the source material\" is not about following plot points with 100% accuracy. TV is a different medium, some concessions and compromises were inevitable. Also, nobody needs another wall of text pointing out where the writers fell short, so instead of that I'll leave you with the main reason for the sadness that the first episode induced.\n\nIt is actually kinda poetic, that the creators of the series \"Mistook stars reflected in a pond for the night sky\" (when I heard the wrong character using this as an almost throwaway line back in season 1, I died a little bit inside), but it's really a shame that they failed to capture the essence of the source material, and instead of showing millions of folks who never had the chance to read The Witcher, the night sky, they showed them that muddy pond.\n\nI won't be finishing this season, though to be fair, I already knew that would be the case. I think that Vesemir stabbing Ciri was the final sin committed by the creators, showing how deeply they misunderstood the story and characters of the Witcher. I guess now is a great time to read the books again and cancel my Netflix subscription, which I wholeheartedly recommend to all of you.\n\nEDIT: Apparently it made me so sad that I swapped a \"y\" for an \"e\" in the title.",

        "body": "Here the youtube clip:\n\n[(6) Yennefer & Ciri argument scene - The Witcher Season 3 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1fe1tFc1ZE)\n\nThis is all wrong because\n\n. Yen was not a fugitive, she was a high ranking mage\n\n. Aretuza was not some weird school that turned girls into eels. It actually gave its students great jobs among powerful courts. Even those girls less successful in magic would become like lawyers / diplomats.\n\n. Ciri and Yen had a great relationship at this point in time. Ciri did not question the idea to attend Aretuza. She wanted it.\n\n. Ciri did run away in the book but just because she got news that Geralt was nearby and she really really wanted to go see Geralt. Because she loves him as a surrogate father. And she wanted to talk with \"daddy\" before going into \"boarding school\".\n\n. Yen did not try to lock Ciri in some kind of punishment. In the book they just sent Ciri to go get some wine and she took the chance to find a way to leave.\n\n.Ciri left a note explaining Yennefer why she was running and that she really wanted to go talk to Geralt and be with him a bit. She also wrote that she would get back and attend Aretuza and she would behave and make Yennefer proud over there.\n\n. Yen´s friends were amused with Ciri´s escape. They thought she had personality\n\n. Yen felt ashamed and terribly concerned. She proceeded to go after Ciri to make sure she would be safe.\n\n. Yen ended up unleashing a bit at Ciri after but just because it was unsafe to runaway alone like that. And it was then that she did place Ciri locked in a room as punishment for risking her life like she had done. But it was more:ok girl, I understand what you did and why. But I cant risk you running around again when its so dangerous for you. There are too many people in town who might be looking for you and you have not shown that I cant trust you being covert.\n\nThe entire point in the books at this time in the story was that Ciri had been 100% safe around Yennefer for quite some time. Therefore, because she was a teenager, Ciri was feeling like she could do all kinds of things just because she wanted. She was loosing sight of the real dangers surrounding her.\n\nWhich is why Yennefer starts to get seriously concerned and feels like its better to end up locking her down before the big magic council. There are just too many people in town who might be a threat. Its not possible to allow Ciri to just go around doing her teenager stuff.\n\nGeralt agreed with this decision to leave Ciri behind locked at a safe place during the magic council. Jaskier was left with her to babysit. \n\nThe overall problem with writing is that the book explains why Ciri acted as she did in town (the series adapted that more or less faithful) and running towards Geralt.   \n\n\nHowever, the series changed Ciri´s life experiences previous to arriving town and then wants to keep her silly teenage actions. Which then does not make sense. \n\nYou have to ask series Ciri: Girl, how come you do not understand this is life or death and you have to make sacrifices? How come you do not understand this after the last couple episodes? \n\nAnd the series makes Ciri look bad.......\n\nWhen in the book, no, she did not understand! She had been perfectly safe with Yen and she was just feeling like a bored teenager who wanted to go talk with people, have fun, go talk with Geralt and tell him all about her magic powers. Also because she had not been with Geralt for quite some time at this point. She missed him a lot!   \n\n\nYou see, when you change the story, you cant keep the characters having the same actions as before. It will make them look weird. There wont be a full explanation to those actions / motivations. ",

        "title": "Scene between Yennefer and Ciri is completely wrong from a book perspective",
        "body": "Here the youtube clip:\n\n[(6) Yennefer & Ciri argument scene - The Witcher Season 3 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1fe1tFc1ZE)\n\nThis is all wrong because\n\n. Yen was not a fugitive, she was a high ranking mage\n\n. Aretuza was not some weird school that turned girls into eels. It actually gave its students great jobs among powerful courts. Even those girls less successful in magic would become like lawyers / diplomats.\n\n. Ciri and Yen had a great relationship at this point in time. Ciri did not question the idea to attend Aretuza. She wanted it.\n\n. Ciri did run away in the book but just because she got news that Geralt was nearby and she really really wanted to go see Geralt. Because she loves him as a surrogate father. And she wanted to talk with \"daddy\" before going into \"boarding school\".\n\n. Yen did not try to lock Ciri in some kind of punishment. In the book they just sent Ciri to go get some wine and she took the chance to find a way to leave.\n\n.Ciri left a note explaining Yennefer why she was running and that she really wanted to go talk to Geralt and be with him a bit. She also wrote that she would get back and attend Aretuza and she would behave and make Yennefer proud over there.\n\n. Yen´s friends were amused with Ciri´s escape. They thought she had personality\n\n. Yen felt ashamed and terribly concerned. She proceeded to go after Ciri to make sure she would be safe.\n\n. Yen ended up unleashing a bit at Ciri after but just because it was unsafe to runaway alone like that. And it was then that she did place Ciri locked in a room as punishment for risking her life like she had done. But it was more:ok girl, I understand what you did and why. But I cant risk you running around again when its so dangerous for you. There are too many people in town who might be looking for you and you have not shown that I cant trust you being covert.\n\nThe entire point in the books at this time in the story was that Ciri had been 100% safe around Yennefer for quite some time. Therefore, because she was a teenager, Ciri was feeling like she could do all kinds of things just because she wanted. She was loosing sight of the real dangers surrounding her.\n\nWhich is why Yennefer starts to get seriously concerned and feels like its better to end up locking her down before the big magic council. There are just too many people in town who might be a threat. Its not possible to allow Ciri to just go around doing her teenager stuff.\n\nGeralt agreed with this decision to leave Ciri behind locked at a safe place during the magic council. Jaskier was left with her to babysit. \n\nThe overall problem with writing is that the book explains why Ciri acted as she did in town (the series adapted that more or less faithful) and running towards Geralt.   \n\n\nHowever, the series changed Ciri´s life experiences previous to arriving town and then wants to keep her silly teenage actions. Which then does not make sense. \n\nYou have to ask series Ciri: Girl, how come you do not understand this is life or death and you have to make sacrifices? How come you do not understand this after the last couple episodes? \n\nAnd the series makes Ciri look bad.......\n\nWhen in the book, no, she did not understand! She had been perfectly safe with Yen and she was just feeling like a bored teenager who wanted to go talk with people, have fun, go talk with Geralt and tell him all about her magic powers. Also because she had not been with Geralt for quite some time at this point. She missed him a lot!   \n\n\nYou see, when you change the story, you cant keep the characters having the same actions as before. It will make them look weird. There wont be a full explanation to those actions / motivations. ",

        "body": "There's *a lot* of complaints happening in this sub right now and I agree with most of it - the show's doing a lot of things wrong. \n\nHowever, I just wanted to point out something I *do* enjoy, and that is the hamminess of the court intrigues. Watching spineless royals like Vizimir  of Redania ham it up as a self-involved puppet has been one of the things I actually enjoy in the show. \n\nHonestly. at this point the Ciri+Geralt+Yen relationship isn't doing it for me at all, and I'd rather just watch court intrigue between the various kings and the mages who manipulate them. (We haven't seen Foltest since season 1, have we?)\n\n\nAlso, people often commend Cavill's performance (and rightfully so) but I'd have to say that Stregobor's actor is probably the most enjoyable whenever he's on screen, and seems the strongest actor. (but seems Lars Mikkelsen's been really underutilized in the first half of the season).\n\n\nWhat are your favourite nuggets of enjoyable performances in the show?",

Redania wants to use her as a political pawn (according to one of Geralt and Jaskier's conversations in the woods). But how would having her be useful for Redania politically? Given how Nifgaard took Cintra, it's kinda unlikely that Emhyr would just hand it back if the rightful heir to the throne came knocking. And having Ciri just makes them a bigger target for Nilfgaard.\n\nIs it just an everyone wants Ciri so if someone gets her it better be us thing or is there anything that Ciri would directly be useful for?",

I am not sure because they deviated a lot from the story I've seen and know.\n\nWhat are their end goals? Emhyrs? Redania, Temeria kingdoms? The brotherhood? Djikstra and Phillipa?

        "title": "The Witcher Season 3 - Pt. 1 is Average (Good/Bad)",
        "body": "Now, it’s safe to say that Season 2 of the Witcher was polarizing for all the involved parties; critics, book fans, game fans, and general audiences alike. Does Season 3 fare any better? Yeah, a little bit.\n\nI think most book fans will appreciate the inclusion of several “book accurate” aspects (I’m gonna use this term loosely as it includes moments that were also re-contextualized or repurposed from the books). I think overall this season serves as a better adaptation of Time of Contempt than season two was of Blood of Elves. But therein lies the problem with this season’s writing. As much as us “book purists” like to complain about how unfaithful the previous season was, this season’s attempts to be more faithful do not mix well with the creative choices made. So much so that in this season the writers have to rush through events and character development to get to a spot where it can actually start adapting the book it’s supposed to be based on. The other problem is that Yennefer’s decisions in the previous season make it very hard to believe the new character dynamics that the show is trying to force the entire time. It’s extremely hard to get invested in the relationships she has with the other characters because she did such a selfish and unforgivable thing, yet the characters seem to do just that very quickly. Because of these changes the writers are forced to make additional changes to make the story match. Now Yennefer has to come up with a reason for the Chapter to forgive her, now the Conclave is her idea. There’s no real way to tell how this is going to end in Part Two since the Conclave was initially already taking place and gave the mages their opportunity for a coup. \n\nThe one thing that this season shares with all the other seasons is its annoying emphasis on side characters and subplots. For a show called “The Witcher” we spend an awful lot of time focusing on this other boring shit. No one cares about the Scoia’tael, no one cares about Cahir and Fringilla, no one cares about Dijkstra and Philippa’s Redania exploits. I understood why the writers decided to focus so much on establishing Yennefer and Ciri as main characters in the first season since the short stories they were adapting didn’t feature them a lot. You want the viewers to have a good foundation for what the show is going to be about, and Ciri’s served to establish the main conflict about Nilfgaard. But this is very flimsy at best. Because Cahir got imprisoned last season, the show has to make a reason for him to get back in Emhyr’s good graces for what I’m assuming is so he can be present at the coup in Thanned? At least that’s what I’m hoping otherwise this subplot will have been even more useless than I initially thought. The problem with this structure is that it takes away the focus from what it’s supposed to be about. The reason the “book purists” are very annoyed about this stuff is because the books don’t have to deal with this lazy and unnecessary writing. The books don’t introduce characters until it needs to and we don’t have to take away time from the main conflict. This was also the reason I did not like season two because it was no longer about progressing the story but about monoliths and Baba Yaga. It’s just a bunch of filler and not very engaging because the writers don’t actually know what to do with these characters, especially now that it’s adapting the actual source material where these characters aren’t featured heavily. Some of this stuff is in the books but very briefly, it’s passing dialogue and meant to be world-building until it becomes important to the story.\n\nI liked the stuff that Geralt gets up to when he’s not burdened by the plot of Time of Contempt and doesn’t have to interact with Yennefer at all. His stuff with Ciri is good too considering they actually have a believable father-daughter relationship. His dynamic duo energy with Jaskier is also very enjoyable to watch. Cavill’s performance is pretty outstanding as usual and it’s a real tragedy that we've gotten to a point where he doesn’t want to be in the show anymore. For a lot of people Cavill was the biggest selling point due to his enthusiasm for the role and faithful portrayal of Geralt. I can’t really judge Liam Hemsworth’s casting as I’ve only seen him in a handful of things, which is actually quite similar to how I felt about Cavill’s casting. I know a lot of people were concerned when Netflix released the test footage but I had only seen (well remembered seeing) him as Superman. Of course, then I rewatched Immortals and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and became more confident with his casting. But the truth became evident from the minute the trailers dropped and ever since he’s been Geralt of Rivia for a lot of people. Even Sapkowski compared his performance to that of Viggo Mortensen’s Aragorn. \n\nOverall the writing was better, the performances were great, and the fight choreography was amazing. Unfortunately, that’s not enough to save it from its stunted beginning and slow pace due to the uninteresting subplots and underdeveloped character arcs. 5/10; average. Let's see if Part Two can salvage this.",

I feel Geralt will be beaten and wounded badly and his healing would result in him having an altered look i.e. Liams entry as geralt. Though he will be the same Geralt, he'll look different because of the healing from very serious wounds.\n\nCould be that im wrong and maybe this has been predicted already by someone but just wanted to put it out there!",

I don't inherently stand by Cavil on this but at the same time it feels kind of shitty the depths they are going to depricate his character and the series as a whole to try and make some statement about him.",

        "title": "On the Shaerrawedd Fight Scene (Spoilers for S3E1 and Blood of Elves)",
        "body": "Having recently seen S3E1 of the Netflix show (note: I haven’t seen any of the other S3 episodes yet), I want to talk about that fight scene at Shaerrawedd. I’ve seen a lot of praise for this scene, and there is certainly a lot to praise there. The action is fluid and brutal. That one long take of Geralt fighting was genuinely awesome. But I still felt that something was off about that scene and, after re-rereading the part of Blood of Elves (chapter 4) that this episode is partially based on, I think I know what it is.\n\nThe fight in Blood of Elves that inspired the S3E1 fight scene was, to put it simply, a tragedy. It was about Geralt abandoning his stated commitment to neutrality and fighting against the Scoia’tael in order to protect Ciri (and Triss, although she wasn’t there in the show), and in doing so contributing to the massacre of elves that he’d hoped to avoid. It was about Yarpen and his band choosing to fight for a human king and against the Scoia’tael (which in the books didn’t just include elves, but all nonhuman races, including dwarves), hoping to preserve something resembling peaceful co-existence with humans, even though the conclusion reveals that their “mission” for the king was just a loyalty test, raising questions of whether they’ll ever not be viewed with suspicion by humans. And it was about the Scoia’tael themselves, fighting and dying for a cause which very well may be in vain. That sense of tragedy persists even in the smaller moments of the fight. Paulie Dahlberg (a member of Yarpen’s band) hesitates for a moment upon seeing that his opponent is a dwarf. Later, an elf woman hesitates when she sees that Ciri is wearing one of the roses of Shaerrawedd. In both cases, their hesitation cost them their lives.\n\nNow, the show does have something similarly tragic about how the fight is set up. Right after Ciri talks about how she can be the one to unite humans and elves and put an end to the endless cycle of violence, she is put in a situation where she has to fight against elves. We see a moment of shock on Ciri’s face when she realizes that Dara is among the Scoia’tael trying to kidnap her. But the show never really follows through on it. Ciri and Dara never meet in combat (he seems to basically disappear for a while after Yennefer force-pushes him). And, for all the show’s efforts to make the violence look brutal, it never really focuses on those being killed. The only death that is given any weight is that of Francesca’s brother, and his death only has meaning to her, not to anyone on Geralt’s side of the fight. The show keeps the tone light enough that the possibility of Jaskier dying can quickly be defused by a joke about not wanting a certain musician to play at his funeral. The scene ends with Yarpen thanking Jaskier for his help. It’s a far cry from how that scene ends in the book, with Yarpen felling betrayed and disgusted by the humans, and Geralt asking for forgiveness from the corpse of an elf woman he killed.\n\nI’m not going to pretend to be unbiased here. The Shaerrawedd chapter in Blood of Elves is one of my favourites in the entire series. And, after season 2 and (especially) Blood Origin, I’ve had serious doubts about the Netflix show. So, if you want to say that I’m just an irrational book fan who’ll hate the show for any minor deviation from the source material, well, you wouldn’t entirely be wrong. But, overall, I don’t hate the show; I just have this constant, frustrating feeling that it could be so much more than it is. And, one of the ways the show could be so much more than it is, I think, would be to focus not just on making the violence look fluid and brutal, but also on what that violence means.",

Later, when Geralt says he doesn't want to lose her, she says 'everything ends.'\n\nThe show changed so much, this feels like a minor thing, but I can't get the feeling out of my head that Geralt/Yen's romance from the books is being altered (ignoring S2). I'm not crazy, right, in the books they **both** finally say they love each other? Or am I misremembering?\n\nWhile I'm on the subject, in Ep 1x6, Yen's all upset about the djinn's magic, but Geralt seems convinced that their feelings are real. In Ep 3x1, Geralt says he left Yen in the mornings because he wasn't sure if their feelings were because of the djinn. Is this a retcon?\n\nNot trying to start any arguments, just curious what others think.",

        "title": "A tier of rulers from the Witcher (books and games) based on how effective they were at ruling their countries",
        "body": "***SPOILERS TO EVERYTHING AHEAD*** (I forgot to write it in the title) \n\nThis is just my opinion, so feel free to disagree and point out something I've forgotten about. Anyway, the list:\n\n1 — Vizimir of Redania. Great king overall, Dikstra speaks fondly of him as a reformer and capable ruler, redanians speak fondly of him as a just and fair king, he was very respected in the North and he won the First Northern War. A great ruler and a great general. \n\n2 — Foltest of Temeria. Also a very effective king, loved by his people, however his carelessness towards the La Valettes lead to a rebellion that ultimately took his life. He was very politically savvy and he would do literally anything for Temeria, plus under his rule Temeria was the biggest military power in the North, for that Foltest gets the proud number 2. \n\n3 — Sigismund Dijkstra of Redania. He is what Radovid could have been, if he wasn't a genocidal maniac. Dijkstra is one the best politicians in the North, hell he basically already ruled Redania once, he's cold, ruthless enough to rule with an iron fist, but not crazy enough to burn people alive. Overall Dijkstra is a very capable ruler. \n\n4 — Cerys an Craite of Skellige Isles. She is young, brave, smart and wants what's best for Skellige, under her rule the islands saw peace and prosperity, even if they lost their previous dread. I think it's the positive change, skelligers can't remain raiders forever and Cerys is their best shot at improvement. \n\n5 — Svanrige an Tuirseach of Skellige. He is an honorable and brave man, he is like king Bran but better, Svanrige unites the entire Skellige and takes the fight to Nilfgaard. His rule establishes a more stable absolute monarchy on the Isles, his war against Nilfgaard is a unifying cause, not just viking raids. Overall Svanrige wants what's best for Skellige, but does it in a different way than Cerys. \n\n6 — the Usurper of Nilfgaard. Not much is known about him, but there is no mention of particularly lot of bloodshed during Usurper's reign, it seems Nilfgaard was ok with him, conquests of the North continued, but he was smart enough to not get stuck in big wars like Emhyr and use political machinations instead. Still, he was overthrown and executed by Emhyr, so however good Usurper was at ruling Nilfgaard, he couldn't keep it. \n\n7 — Ethain of Cidaris. Wise politician, good strategist, brave king and for a change a noble who doesn't want Dandelion dead. Ethain is described as just towards his people, he managed to hold his pretty small kingdom against the Nilfgaardian war machine practically alone, using unconventional very Meve-like tactics. Overall Ethain is one of the examples of really good rulers. \n\n8 — Esterad Thyssen of Kovir & Poviss. He was a peaceful ruler, despite the fact that he came to power using a coup, he was loved and supported by his people, Esterad managed to keep his country together despite countless challenges and never resolved to bloodbath. While he kept neutral in the Second Northern War, he still helped the North as best he could without officially stepping into the war. \n\n9 — Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard. Great schemist, powerful and effective ruler, not so great general. He started 3 wars against the Northern Realms and lost 2 of them, by the time of Witcher 3 his mistakes catch up to him. In politics Emhyr is brilliant, in warfare however he is very well matched by the Redanian kings and that caused him and his country a lot of troubles.\n\n10 — Calanthe of Cintra. Arguably a good queen, she's loved by her people, respected by her allies, feared by her enemies. Although she was selfish and not so great of a schemist, Calanthe was good at ruling Cintra, but I don't remember her being anything special as a politician.\n\n11 — Henselt of Kaedwen. He is an asshole, but damn is he an effective asshole. Despite his war for Upper Aedirn being unsuccessful, in wars against Nilfgaard Kaedwen proved to be irreplaceable, even earning its king the title \"Vanquisher of Nilfgaard\". Under Henselt's rule Kaedwen is one of the main powers in the North. And Henselt is quite savvy, he is a good schemist, he can use political opportunities and not just his fists to solve problems. \n\n12 — Radovid of Redania. Yeah, I know, he is basically Hitler, but Radovid was the reason Nilfgaard was once again deeply stuck in a war against the North, despite all of Emhyr's schemes to weaken the North, it prevailed thanks to Radovid. He is a brilliant strategist and a very cunning bastard, although his rule was blood, blood and even more blood, his effectiveness in times of great crisis is legendary. If only he wasn't so much of a blood-thirsty maniac, Radovid would be one of the best rulers in the Witcher Saga.\n\n13 — Meve of Lyria & Rivia. Meve is a great tactician, but a poor strategist, it is her fault that a coup against her was plotted behind her back, it is her fault that her own son turned on her and usurped the throne. Meve was very neglecting of her children and as it seems couldn't be bothered to equip herself with a loyal spymaster or a court wizard, so the throne was taken right from under her and she never saw it coming. However on the battlefield Meve is a bloody genius, possibly the best tactician in the North and her bravery is unmatched among her royal colleagues, so she gets 11th place. \n\n14 — Eithné of Brokilon. Kinda hard to judge Eithné since she isn't your typical ruler. She is an isolationist, she is successful with keeping dh'oine out of the forest, but she slowly loses (humans are still cutting Brokilon down, little by little). She is an absolute monarch and doesn't seem to have any rivals in the forest, so a point for keeping stability. Eithné's entire policy is \"shoot first and don't ask anything at all\", it works so far, but at some point humans will tame Brokilon. Eithné denies progress and at some point she will be overpowered by her neighbors. \n\n15 — Francesca Findabair of Dol Blathanna. The odds aren't in her favor, but Francesca is supposed to be the most cunning diplomat in the world, she is very old, experienced, smart, however her rule wasn't long or particularly successful, so that's why she is so low. \n\n16 — Demavend of Aedirn. Not extraordinary smart, not extraordinary brave, Demavend is the average selfish king, but you gotta give him props for his campaign to retake Aedirn during the Second War. \n\n17 — Bran an Tuirseach of Skellige. He united Skellige and did his best to keep it that way, however Bran wasn't interested in developing the Isles, he would go away for half a year into raids, return with plunder and everyone would cherish him for that. Skellige was stagnating under him. \n\n18 — Hjalmar an Craite of Skellige. He is king Bran but with even less political savvy, he is interested in glory, plunder and a good death in battle, Hjalmar will just continue Skellige's viking stagnation, but with Cerys at his side he might do a few good things. Still, Hjalmar is stubborn and isn't interested in developing the Isles, at fast rate they will eventually be stuck in a war with either Nilfgaard or Redania and that war they wouldn't be able to win. \n\n? — Cirilla of Nilfgaard. I honestly can't decide whether Ciri would be a good empress or a horrible one. She knows the North, that would give her an advantage in ruling a freshly conquered region, she has a good heart, so I don't see her slaughtering her own people, but at the same time Ciri has the political savvy of a training dummy. I guess with Emhyr and Philippa at her side she could learn, but at the same time Philippa might be her downfall, just as she was for Vizimir. So I don't know. Ciri might be ok if she surrounds herself with capable and loyal advisors, but on her own? No, really don't think so, it's hard enough to rule a small kingdom, let alone a giant empire.",

        "body": "I'm reading Wheel of Time right now and I have only watched the Witcher TV adaptation and played some of the first game. But even so I am struck by the similarities. I will do my best to avoid spoiling anything you wouldn't learn by reading a few chapters of WoT book 1, and I ask that commenters do the same, please. \n\n[This article](https://screenrant.com/wheel-of-time-characters-their-witcher-counterparts-versions/) makes many of my points for me but some are not made and some I disagree with.\n\n1. The entire \"battle of the sexes\" thing between Aretuza and Ban Ard is HUGE in Wheel of Time. Male and female magic users have no love lost between them. This subplot might have been more for the show than the books, but as I saw it in the show it is *strikingly* similar to WoT in tone.\n\n2. Aretuza and the White Tower are very similar in general. The Brotherhood doesn't match WoT as well, but both Aretuza and the Tower intentionally try to station their graduates with political powers. Aes Sedai in general basically act like Tissaia does in the show. Tissaia feels a bit more like Sheriam than Moiraine for me but Jordan writes most Aes Sedai as incredibly similar people.\n\n3. That brings me to a really big one. Cintra and Andor are incredibly similar. Both have a lion symbol, both are powerful nations, both have a tradition of queens, and both have an unusually important place in the plot and key characters' lives. Morgase's relationship with Gareth Bryne is similar to Calanthe and...I have forgotten his name, but the guy from the show. Elayne is blond and of a similar age to Ciri at book/show start. From a personality and background perspective, they are very similar, but I do agree with the article that Ciri is similar to Rand in terms of value to the overarching plot.\n\n4. The Witchers are persecuted users of what might be considered magical abilities--and they are all male. Not everyone gets terribly worked up over them, but certain groups of people definitely do. This is a little like False Dragons in WoT, but it isn't the closest match.\n\n5. The Witchers resemble the Warders of WoT, though. Individually, Warders are almost exactly like watered-down Witchers. Little display of emotion, enhanced senses, enhanced speed and strength, and enhanced durability come to mind. The main difference is that Warders are servants of Aes Sedai (female magic users) and bound to them and thus share political status. Like Witchers, they can be hated by lots of people and outright persecuted in certain areas, but unlike Witchers there are a lot more of them and they have a bit more protection. I'd call Warders peak human except for their durability, which is slightly better. Oh, Warders also often have lots of knowledge about monsters (Shadowspawn in WoT) and the Warder we know best, Lan, is an outlier in this because he comes from a particularly monster-infested part of the world. Lan in particular is very Witcher-esque, though I disagree that he is particularly like Geralt out of all Witchers. Lan is not a ladies' man.\n\nI don't find the plot or metaphysics of these worlds to have much similarity, but it genuinely seems like one is taking inspiration from the other, or if not, perhaps they are taking inspiration from a common source. I have felt several times that WoT is inspired by Dune (the Aiel and Rand's relationship with them is like straight out of Dune), and that could explain some of the gender politics thing. But I don't see Dune influencing Sapkowski at all.\n\nI'm curious what fans of the Witcher who have encountered both series think about this.",

        "body": "While I'm now playing through The Witcher 3 for the 3rd time and I'm having another great gaming experience, I've been wondering why in both the games and the Netflix series pretty much all the sorceresses, besides obviously Yennefer and Triss, are completely enchanted by Geralt and all of them want to sleep with him or get his attention. \n\nI've also read the books, but I don't remember Geralt having that kind of hit with women there either, but maybe I just read over that part.\n\nIs this a power play to get back at Yennefer and hurt her or does Geralt have a special aura/role?\n\nIt can't be his profession alone, since there are other witchers who don't seduce rows and rows of sorceresses so successfully?\n\nWhat do you think makes Geralt so particularly attractive or desirable in this respect?",

        "body": "I am fully aware topics like this has been posted before, but i couldn't find any recent ones. Keep in mind i have watched some of the Netflix show, and played through the game untill you get back to the witcher fortress. Consider this a rant of sorts, but also a question to the fandom as a whole. \n\nWhy do people believe Yennefer is a good partner for Geralt?\n\nI see it in every thread that mentions the Triss VS Yennefer argument. And as someone who has had multiple abusive partners i cannot for the life of me understand why people like Yennefer. \n\nShe is rude beyond just banter, she CONSTANTLY breaks Geralts boundaries and completely disregard or ignore his attempts at establishing them (im talking about the mind reading for example). She holds a huge grudge over the amnesia stuff, yet refuses to accept apologies of any kind and constantly uses it against Geralt. Let me say that again: she is mad at geralt for liking someone else when he didnt know she existed (at least that is my understanding from the game dialogue).\n\nShe is vindictive, bossy and seems to think her relationship with Geralt is a one way street. She gets to annoy, tease and belittle him but the second he returns fire she gets pissy about it. To the point where she threatens to KILL HIM when he snaps at her for teleporting him above a river. She is also disrespectful to everyone around her that has less power than she does. Even to Vezimir (which is crossing a line in my book).\n\nBut one of the worst things for me is whenever Geralt asks \"what do you need this for?\" or \"whats your plan\" her answer is some holier than thou bs like \"I will explain when the time is right\" and so far that has always been AFTER the fact unless Geralt threaten her to leave.\n\nFrom my personal experience, and from the game i have played so far, Yennefer is abusive as all hell and Geralt deserves so much better.

(God I made that sound like a chore didn't I?) \nAnd I've rediscovered the love I have for this universe. I even had a moment of contemplation which ended with me concluding that Sapkowski has managed to write my favourite work of fiction ever, thus far at least. \n\nThese books might also be some of the most philosophical fantasy books I've ever encountered. People will probably disagree and I encourage you to sure your alternatives to enlighten me. I'm always searching for the most philosophical books I can find. But I digress.\n\nBecause even tho Sapkowskis dialouge often feels like it flip flops to and fro and often manages to feel really ridiculous I still love it. The characters use big words, what they say can often be incredibly philosophical, they feel equally as intelligent as they can feel ridiculous. The Witcher books are the only ones where I feel like I sometimes can't keep up with the characters because they're simply a level above me when it comes to using the grey matter I have in my skull, and God do I love it. \nWhen Geralt and Regis snap at each other about monsters and Witchers and morals and all that shit and they descend into incredibly philosophical discussions/arguments in the middle of no where, I fall just that much deeper in love with this work of fiction.\nThe books have definite flaws, they do. But I love them all the same.\n\nThis is guaranteed not as well thought out or expressed as I probably want it to be but I felt compelled to share and I hope someone may want to add something or share some other book recommendations 🤷",

        "title": "My opinion on Roche vs Iorveth after playing both sides",
        "body": "I finally made it through my first full playthrough of TW2 so I feel like I'd give you my opinion on the alternate paths. I liked that the two routes were different enough yet somewhat similar and both with a very intricate quest structure. In fact, I liked both of them so much that I think I might always play them together if I do another playthrough in the future. If you forced me to choose one with a crossbow on my head, I would probably say I prefer Iorveth's path by a small margin, but Roche's also has its merits. So here's my definitive pros and cons list.\n\nROCHE\n\nPROS: You get to kill Loredo - More information about the Sabrina curse - More focus on the kingslayers investigation -  the necromancy scene - Dethmold is a cool villain - Ves is a better romance (personal taste) - Roche is a bro - Some interesting characters from books like Zyvik and Pangratt  - Little Sisters is an interesting side quest - The Rotfiend Contract is less annoying than the Harpy one - overall Geralt remains neutral, he's not even part of the siege - Roche killing Henselt - Roche killing Dethmold - Some interesting political drama in Loc Muinne\n\nCONS: The camp looks cool but it's not a very witcher-y location - The consiparcy plotline could have been a little better - The search for Triss is almost entirely ignored - Stennis is killed unceremoniously - Less Saskia, Zoltan and Yarpen - Iorveth has no major role after Flotsam - We don't get to see Philippa's fate though it's an important event - The Lilies and Vipers questline is interesting but slows down the third act - We don't know the truth of Saskia\n\nIORVETH\n\nPROS: Vergen is a better location - more Zoltan and Yarpen and overall more dwarves - Stennis and Saskia are interesting additions to the cast - More Philippa ('nuff said) - The funny LOTR references - Iorveth is an unlikely friend - The plot of the poisoning of Saskia is interesting and you need to be careful to collect all the evidence - Geralt is more involved in the search for Triss - Cynthia is an interesting minor villain - LESBOMANCY! - Roche still has a relevant role in the plot, and he's still a bro - The funny succubus side quest with Dandelion - The siege quest is awsome - Dethmold dies by default - We get to see Philippa's blinding (both horrific yet somewhat deserved) - Saving Saskia vs Triss is a harder choice from player's perspective\n\nCONS: Loredo would most likely run away - The plotline of Letho and the kingslayers is almost non-existent - Sabrina's curse is less prominent in the story and feels just like an inconvenience - How exactly did Philippa managed to find two of the items needed to lift the mist? We never know and it feels like a cheap solution - Henselt can't die - While the siege is cool it feels weird to see Geralt so much involved in the Vergen conflict - Assire's death was underwhelming - We don't learn anything about what happened to Foltest's children - Secrets of Loc Muinne is a cool quest but it still feels out of place \n\nOne thing I also didn't like in both paths was the inconsistency between the events of the Prelude to War quests, before the mist is released and Geralt intervenes. That, and the choice of saving Triss vs saving Anaïs/Saskia feels artifical since the game treats it like you don't have time to do both, but you can still do whatever you want in Loc Muinne before going to the summit. \n\nAnd you? What things you loved or hated in a particular path?",

        "body": "So, in this episode, Geralt meets up with a Druid who knew his mom.\n\nWithout reminding the audience of Geralt’s mom’s name, the Druid informs Geralt that Vissenna is dead. Can’t say that info hit me very hard, since I missed the next few lines of dialogue while wracking my brain to remember who Vessenna was! \n\nAnd Geralt, in Geralt fashion, reacted in a very muted way. I wished the writers had contrived something to bring out his emotions on the matter a bit more clearly…. I suppose all the wood chopping was stress relief,  but there’s a missed opportunity there for a character we really care about to experience something profound, and bring us along for those feelings. \n\nHis whole storyline is about parenthood and his abandonment issues. His mother’s death should be treated as a major milestone, but it’s almost like a throwaway line. \n\n\nBut ok, so Vissenna is Geralt’s mom. It seems her death must have been recent, since Geralt didn’t notice it until now and actually MET his mom after Nilfgaard’s defeat (perhaps a year ago?) But we watched Geralt interacting with generations of a noble family back in season 1, firmly establishing him as over 100 years old. So how long did his mother live, and why?\n\nI thought the immortal  health of mages came from the trade of their fertility. Clearly Geralt’s mother wasn’t infertile, so?? Why did she live so long?\n\nThe real burning question for me is, why did Vissenna stay away from Geralt after he learned to keep himself safe?\n\nShe sent him to the witchers to learn how to protect for himself and provide for himself,  as she was struggling to do so. She thought he was safer facing the deadly Trial of Grass than growing up with her! \n\nBut once Geralt grew strong, why couldn’t they be together again? He’s been an adult for like 80 years now… they clearly miss each other and have unresolved feelings so… why not reunite? Instead we get a random chance meetings, no answers, and indirect news of her death. \n\n\n(I haven’t seen past season 3 episode 3 yet)",

        "body": "\"In the book, [Yennefer's] described as the most beautiful woman in the world. This was a few years ago and I'd like to think things have changed. But when you think about people's unconscious bias -- especially in the fantasy world, it felt like these worlds were predominantly white. And I remember saying, 'I feel like we need to challenge what people think of as the standard of beauty. And having a woman of color in this role does incredibly powerful things to the people watching.'\"\n\nKinda feels like you're just screwing your own goal over even more when you then make your diversity hire a considerably shittier character...\n\nI actually don't mind Anya Chalotra as Yennefer, they have just let her down hard with the atrocious writing",

        "title": "Summer Reading Reviews",
        "body": "  \n\nHi Fantasy Folks! I have been on a bit of a reading spree lately. I am sort of doing a genre triangle where I read a fantasy book, a horror book and then a SF book. This is to keep myself from burning out as well as to keep my reading fresh. (I may also do book reviews for my 6 SF books on r/printSF and have already done one for the horror books on r/horrorlit [https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/15a7jvq/review\\_sixpack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/15a7jvq/review_sixpack/) as an FYI if you like those genres as well). Preamble over! Let's review. \n\nLowest reviewed to highest.\n\n**The Time of Contempt by Andrzej Sapkowski**\n\nBasic Outline- Book 2 of The Witcher main series. Geralt must balance his need to protect his adopted daughter Ciri against her ultimate destiny. There are forces at work trying to use Ciri as a pawn in their games and Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri must decide which is the path that is right? \n\nThoughts- I had previously read The Last Wish and Blood of Elves years ago and I really enjoyed The Last Wish but Blood of Elves…not so much. In fact the years long hiatus was due to my dislike of Blood Elves where it felt like such a slog and a meandering story. Not so with The Time of Contempt. This was a very nicely paced Witcher book with lots of intrigue and plenty of action to keep momentum going. I would sort of say it is split up into three parts with parts one and two being my favourites. Part one primarily develops the relationships between the main three characters nicely, while the second part delves into major strife and action in the magical school. The final part is where it lost me a little. Without going into spoilers some of the actions of the character in part three were weird and written in my opinion questionably. However, I am interested in where that section goes and I am excited to see that character’s development in the new setting.   \n\nRating-4/5 stars. This book helped save my Witcher readthrough after almost DNFing the previous book in the series. I am back on board and interested in the next adventure. \n\n**Fairy Tale by Stephen King**\n\nBasic Outline- A highschooler saves an old hermits life on his way home from school one day. He develops a camaraderie with the crotchety old fellow and loves his old German Shepherd. What he doesn’t know is that the old man harbors a secret one that will lead him into a fantastic land where Fairy Tales are real. \n\nThoughts- As usual Stephen King is my soft spot. This was the book that started my book binge and he is old reliable to me despite sometimes missing the mark. That was not the case here. I have heard differing opinions on this book but for me I really enjoyed it. In particular the first parts with the MC and his interactions with the old curmudgeon on regular old Earth. There is something about the way King writes relationships that just work for me. You will love this dog, the relationship between the MC and old guy are wholesome and lovely. Yes it is sprinkled in with some insane passages where King attempts to be “hip” and write his teenager and it comes off out of touch but not to the point where I was take out beyond a quick eyeroll here or there. The adventure into the magical land was interesting and fun and sprinkled in some horror. I didn’t mind where that story went either in the later parts of the story despite perhaps staying there a little too long and having some of the conclusion wrapped up in an overly convenient way. It won’t be on my all-time list whatsoever for King but for his modern stuff I think it has been one of his better ones of late. \n\nRating-4/5 stars. Enjoyable story with some great relationship work. Dog lovers enjoy! Some parts go on a little long and there are some overly convenient elements to the plot. However, a just pure fun read for me. \n\n**The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie**\n\nBasic Outline- Logen Ninefingers a battle scarred northerner trying to clean up his act and become a better person, Inquisitor Glokta a maimed, crippled torturer working for the Inquisition and Jezal dan Luthar the chiseled golden boy and would-be fencing champion what do they have in common? Venture into the First Law trilogy where everyone has something to hide and no one is as innocent or guilty as they seem… \n\nThoughts- This has to be the most recommended series I have seen in a while. As someone who loves A Song of Ice and Fire this was on my radar as another “grey” series to pick up. Lo and behold I liked it a lot. Abercrombie’s strength is clearly his characters. They are so well realized and detailed that I would know who they are just based on their voice. Abercrombie gets you to root for them even when you actively dislike them or their actions. The main critique of this book and I understand it (there’s a reason why this is the lowest rated of the three) is that there is not much to the plot in this one and the trilogy is meant to be read as a trilogy and less as standalone books with a beginning, middle and end. As I said it didn’t bother me but if someone asked what the plot was of this book I’d have like three things to quickly say and then blab on about the awesome characters for thirty minutes. \n\nRating-4/5 stars. Fantastic start to an all-time trilogy, some of the best written characters in fiction. The story is pretty slow going as it is meant to be read as a trilogy. \n\n**The Winter King by Bernard Cornwell**\n\nBasic Outline- The tale of King Arthur and his knights have been told time and time again but never like this. Cornwell reimagines the legend into 5th century Britain with all of the backstabbing, violence and religious mania of the time. Book 1 of 3 of The Warlord Chronicles. \n\nThoughts- I have always wanted to read a more modern take on King Arthur. I found that this was almost universally praised as one of the great reimagining’s of the legend. I have only read this first book in the trilogy and I am already fully invested. Cornwell makes you really feel the filth and cheapness of life in this story during the time period. The constant strife between kingdoms and cultures and religion are nonstop. The new characters he creates including our narrator Derfel are outstanding. The way he reframes the ones we already know (Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin etc.) is wonderful. They seem like real people with flaws we can relate to and aspects we can hate or love. Cornwell with one character in particular changes his legend in such a way and makes his relationship with our narrator Derfel so contentious that I was actually laughing out loud at their interactions. The battle sequences are brutal and bloody and some of the best larger scale battles I have read in quite some time. I am eager to read the next two books as I hear the second book in particular is amazing. \n\nRating-4/5 stars. An amazing start to a reimagining of the tale of King Arthur. Only thing holding it back is a slightly unsatisfying conclusion which I imagine will get resolved in the next books. \n\n**Before They are Hanged by Joe Abercrombie**\n\nBasic Outline- The First Law Trilogy continues and we are dealing with sieges, searches, swords and snow! \n\nThoughts- This expanded on everything I enjoyed about the first book and made it better. Many of our characters are together and it allows for interaction between favourites. We get some development which in some characters cases it felt long overdue. For me reading the first book I didn’t dislike Dogman chapters but when I saw one I sort of went oh man and tried to get through it to the next POV. Not so in this book where Dogman and crew gets some great moments. The siege story line was great as well and Glokta and Logen are competing against each other for favourite character in this series. As usual some great fight sequences and similar to the first book an ending which was better than the first but still a little so-so. I also specifically remember finishing this book and going how is he going to wrap all this up in one final book!?\n\nRating-4.5/5 stars. Another excellent entry in the trilogy. Characters get to adventure together and interact which is awesome. Abercrombie continues to write epic battles and dialogue but where is it all leading?\n\n**Last Argument of Kings**\n\nBasic Outline- The First Law trilogy comes to close with twists, turns and turmoil. \n\nThoughts- Based on my other two blurbs you could probably expect that this book would be the highest rated of the bunch. Wow did I not expect a lot of the things that occur in this book and I loved every minute of it. In particular one of the best duels, I have ever read like come on so amazing. There’s not a lot to say without spoilers so I will say for me it concluded in a way a series like this always needed to conclude.

        "body": "  \n\nHi Fantasy Folks! I have been on a bit of a reading spree lately. I am sort of doing a genre triangle where I read a fantasy book, a horror book and then a SF book. This is to keep myself from burning out as well as to keep my reading fresh. (I may also do book reviews for my 6 SF books on r/printSF and have already done one for the horror books on r/horrorlit [https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/15a7jvq/review\\_sixpack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/15a7jvq/review_sixpack/) as an FYI if you like those genres as well). Preamble over! Let's review. \n\nLowest reviewed to highest.\n\n**The Time of Contempt by Andrzej Sapkowski**\n\nBasic Outline- Book 2 of The Witcher main series. Geralt must balance his need to protect his adopted daughter Ciri against her ultimate destiny. There are forces at work trying to use Ciri as a pawn in their games and Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri must decide which is the path that is right? \n\nThoughts- I had previously read The Last Wish and Blood of Elves years ago and I really enjoyed The Last Wish but Blood of Elves…not so much. In fact the years long hiatus was due to my dislike of Blood Elves where it felt like such a slog and a meandering story. Not so with The Time of Contempt. This was a very nicely paced Witcher book with lots of intrigue and plenty of action to keep momentum going. I would sort of say it is split up into three parts with parts one and two being my favourites. Part one primarily develops the relationships between the main three characters nicely, while the second part delves into major strife and action in the magical school. The final part is where it lost me a little. Without going into spoilers some of the actions of the character in part three were weird and written in my opinion questionably. However, I am interested in where that section goes and I am excited to see that character’s development in the new setting.   \n\nRating-4/5 stars. This book helped save my Witcher readthrough after almost DNFing the previous book in the series. I am back on board and interested in the next adventure. \n\n**Fairy Tale by Stephen King**\n\nBasic Outline- A highschooler saves an old hermits life on his way home from school one day. He develops a camaraderie with the crotchety old fellow and loves his old German Shepherd. What he doesn’t know is that the old man harbors a secret one that will lead him into a fantastic land where Fairy Tales are real. \n\nThoughts- As usual Stephen King is my soft spot. This was the book that started my book binge and he is old reliable to me despite sometimes missing the mark. That was not the case here. I have heard differing opinions on this book but for me I really enjoyed it. In particular the first parts with the MC and his interactions with the old curmudgeon on regular old Earth. There is something about the way King writes relationships that just work for me. You will love this dog, the relationship between the MC and old guy are wholesome and lovely. Yes it is sprinkled in with some insane passages where King attempts to be “hip” and write his teenager and it comes off out of touch but not to the point where I was take out beyond a quick eyeroll here or there. The adventure into the magical land was interesting and fun and sprinkled in some horror. I didn’t mind where that story went either in the later parts of the story despite perhaps staying there a little too long and having some of the conclusion wrapped up in an overly convenient way. It won’t be on my all-time list whatsoever for King but for his modern stuff I think it has been one of his better ones of late. \n\nRating-4/5 stars. Enjoyable story with some great relationship work. Dog lovers enjoy! Some parts go on a little long and there are some overly convenient elements to the plot. However, a just pure fun read for me. \n\n**The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie**\n\nBasic Outline- Logen Ninefingers a battle scarred northerner trying to clean up his act and become a better person, Inquisitor Glokta a maimed, crippled torturer working for the Inquisition and Jezal dan Luthar the chiseled golden boy and would-be fencing champion what do they have in common? Venture into the First Law trilogy where everyone has something to hide and no one is as innocent or guilty as they seem… \n\nThoughts- This has to be the most recommended series I have seen in a while. As someone who loves A Song of Ice and Fire this was on my radar as another “grey” series to pick up. Lo and behold I liked it a lot. Abercrombie’s strength is clearly his characters. They are so well realized and detailed that I would know who they are just based on their voice. Abercrombie gets you to root for them even when you actively dislike them or their actions. The main critique of this book and I understand it (there’s a reason why this is the lowest rated of the three) is that there is not much to the plot in this one and the trilogy is meant to be read as a trilogy and less as standalone books with a beginning, middle and end. As I said it didn’t bother me but if someone asked what the plot was of this book I’d have like three things to quickly say and then blab on about the awesome characters for thirty minutes. \n\nRating-4/5 stars. Fantastic start to an all-time trilogy, some of the best written characters in fiction. The story is pretty slow going as it is meant to be read as a trilogy. \n\n**The Winter King by Bernard Cornwell**\n\nBasic Outline- The tale of King Arthur and his knights have been told time and time again but never like this. Cornwell reimagines the legend into 5th century Britain with all of the backstabbing, violence and religious mania of the time. Book 1 of 3 of The Warlord Chronicles. \n\nThoughts- I have always wanted to read a more modern take on King Arthur. I found that this was almost universally praised as one of the great reimagining’s of the legend. I have only read this first book in the trilogy and I am already fully invested. Cornwell makes you really feel the filth and cheapness of life in this story during the time period. The constant strife between kingdoms and cultures and religion are nonstop. The new characters he creates including our narrator Derfel are outstanding. The way he reframes the ones we already know (Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin etc.) is wonderful. They seem like real people with flaws we can relate to and aspects we can hate or love. Cornwell with one character in particular changes his legend in such a way and makes his relationship with our narrator Derfel so contentious that I was actually laughing out loud at their interactions. The battle sequences are brutal and bloody and some of the best larger scale battles I have read in quite some time. I am eager to read the next two books as I hear the second book in particular is amazing. \n\nRating-4/5 stars. An amazing start to a reimagining of the tale of King Arthur. Only thing holding it back is a slightly unsatisfying conclusion which I imagine will get resolved in the next books. \n\n**Before They are Hanged by Joe Abercrombie**\n\nBasic Outline- The First Law Trilogy continues and we are dealing with sieges, searches, swords and snow! \n\nThoughts- This expanded on everything I enjoyed about the first book and made it better. Many of our characters are together and it allows for interaction between favourites. We get some development which in some characters cases it felt long overdue. For me reading the first book I didn’t dislike Dogman chapters but when I saw one I sort of went oh man and tried to get through it to the next POV. Not so in this book where Dogman and crew gets some great moments. The siege story line was great as well and Glokta and Logen are competing against each other for favourite character in this series. As usual some great fight sequences and similar to the first book an ending which was better than the first but still a little so-so. I also specifically remember finishing this book and going how is he going to wrap all this up in one final book!?\n\nRating-4.5/5 stars. Another excellent entry in the trilogy. Characters get to adventure together and interact which is awesome. Abercrombie continues to write epic battles and dialogue but where is it all leading?\n\n**Last Argument of Kings**\n\nBasic Outline- The First Law trilogy comes to close with twists, turns and turmoil. \n\nThoughts- Based on my other two blurbs you could probably expect that this book would be the highest rated of the bunch. Wow did I not expect a lot of the things that occur in this book and I loved every minute of it. In particular one of the best duels, I have ever read like come on so amazing. There’s not a lot to say without spoilers so I will say for me it concluded in a way a series like this always needed to conclude. I have a minor gripe here or there (most of which are in the camp of what happens now instead of I didn’t like what happened) but I am hoping to have some answers in the standalones and sequel trilogy. Abercrombie has shot up my charts as an author to follow and I am very excited to continue this series. \n\nRating-5/5 stars. Concludes one of the best trilogies I have ever read.

        "title": "Season Three - Part Two is a mess",
        "body": " Frankly, the last three episodes of the season are really more of the same, but the implications for the rest of the series is what truly frustrates me even more. The writing, editing, and acting are all carried over from part one and really don’t save or redeem the entire season. The emotional beats are stilted due to poor character development and set up and the season seems content with just riding the action and shock of its plot points. I still can’t get behind the forced relationship Yen supposedly has with Geralt and Ciri. It doesn’t work and hearing Yen say “I love you, my daughter” is the most cringe-inducing line I’ve heard in this entire show because the writers think this is genuinely emotionally responsive. The magical duels themselves are also quite bland, using the same type of magic repeatedly without any real creativity and ingenuity. The only time anything really mind blowing happens is when Tissaia and Stregobor actually decide to unleash their full power. The duel between Geralt in Vilgefortz is surprisingly well done and book-accurate for the most part, though it is undermined a little due to the changes they made to their conversation the night earlier. Then, to top it all off we have another fucking monolith, since clearly they didn’t learn their lesson the first two times. Cahir, Fringilla, and Francesca are wasted time and space, and honestly the past seasons have made me actively dislike their characters. But the writers really want to stress how important these characters are for absolutely the wrong reason. \n\nThe writers also made the strange decision to remove the main trio from the actual confines of Aretuza to wander aimlessly around the island while the mages duel Nilfgaard and the elves. So almost immediately the tension dissipates and then the writers have to force the “difficult decision” Yennefer makes just to have her run all the way back. In the books it's much more terrifying because they’re literally trapped at Aretuza because Nilfgaard and Redania are both hunting Ciri. Both Yen and Geralt are trying to clear the path and protect Ciri as she tries to escape, only then being forced into the Tower. You’re probably wondering why I’m focusing so much on the deviations from the books, but it just has to be said that the show is at its strongest when it actually includes book elements. Generally speaking not all changes from the source material is inherently bad when making an adaptation, but I can’t think of a single deviation that hasn’t been detrimental to the story they’re trying to tell. Even though I’ve understood the decision to make changes, the show immediately throws out any potential that change could have had. \n\nI’ve only covered the first episode so far. Admittedly, the second episode is probably the least offensive in this respect as it does follow the books closer when telling Ciri’s story. And Geralt is taken to Brokilon where Jaskier finds him recuperating. But, in order to pad out the runtime we also spend some time focusing on subplots, like the sorceresses cleaning up the mess and the romance between Jaskier and Radovid. The latter is something that I refused to address in my previous posts as it didn’t really affect my viewing experience. But then the scene between them at Aretuza happened and I involuntarily muttered, “why are we focusing on this right now.” Of all the plot points to continue at this time in the story, their romance should not be the priority. It’s also important to note that we already saw a conclusion to their subplot in the previous episode, only for it to be thrown out the window here. The final episode is probably my least favorite because it’s so overly drawn out. Geralt’s recovery mixed with the forming of the Lodge isn’t the most interesting part of this season. It probably would’ve been more beneficial to intercut between all three of the stories parallel to each other instead of forcing us to watch long sequences that don’t really progress the story. It might have been more worth it if Geralt didn’t just have Yennefer heal him at the end, therefore making his entire trip to Brokilon completely redundant in the first place. But I do think it was a good choice to introduce Milva here as opposed to the beginning of next season. There was a lot of talk about how Geralt’s story would end this season concerning the swapping of actors set to take place next season. I’m glad that most of the rumors were untrue, but I can’t help but feel we didn’t get the proper sendoff for this version of the character like we were promised. But it’s whatever I guess.\n\nThis season has surely shown us that even when Netflix tries to actually adapt the books they still don’t know what they're doing. Each individual season is muddled with incoherent writing and execution, only fueling the firestorm that is the overall series. At this point the only point of interest for the series moving forward is simply morbid curiosity. How much more can Netflix drag the source material through the mud?",

        "title": "Season Three - Part Two is a mess",
        "body": " Frankly, the last three episodes of the season are really more of the same, but the implications for the rest of the series is what truly frustrates me even more. The writing, editing, and acting are all carried over from part one and really don’t save or redeem the entire season. The emotional beats are stilted due to poor character development and set up and the season seems content with just riding the action and shock of its plot points. I still can’t get behind the forced relationship Yen supposedly has with Geralt and Ciri. It doesn’t work and hearing Yen say “I love you, my daughter” is the most cringe-inducing line I’ve heard in this entire show because the writers think this is genuinely emotionally responsive. The magical duels themselves are also quite bland, using the same type of magic repeatedly without any real creativity and ingenuity. The only time anything really mind blowing happens is when Tissaia and Stregobor actually decide to unleash their full power. The duel between Geralt in Vilgefortz is surprisingly well done and book-accurate for the most part, though it is undermined a little due to the changes they made to their conversation the night earlier. Then, to top it all off we have another fucking monolith, since clearly they didn’t learn their lesson the first two times. Cahir, Fringilla, and Francesca are wasted time and space, and honestly the past seasons have made me actively dislike their characters. But the writers really want to stress how important these characters are for absolutely the wrong reason.\n\nThe writers also made the strange decision to remove the main trio from the actual confines of Aretuza to wander aimlessly around the island while the mages duel Nilfgaard and the elves. So almost immediately the tension dissipates and then the writers have to force the “difficult decision” Yennefer makes just to have her run all the way back. In the books it's much more terrifying because they’re literally trapped at Aretuza because Nilfgaard and Redania are both hunting Ciri. Both Yen and Geralt are trying to clear the path and protect Ciri as she tries to escape, only then being forced into the Tower. You’re probably wondering why I’m focusing so much on the deviations from the books, but it just has to be said that the show is at its strongest when it actually includes book elements. Generally speaking not all changes from the source material is inherently bad when making an adaptation, but I can’t think of a single deviation that hasn’t been detrimental to the story they’re trying to tell. Even though I’ve understood the decision to make changes, the show immediately throws out any potential that change could have had.\n\nI’ve only covered the first episode so far. Admittedly, the second episode is probably the least offensive in this respect as it does follow the books closer when telling Ciri’s story. And Geralt is taken to Brokilon where Jaskier finds him recuperating. But, in order to pad out the runtime we also spend some time focusing on subplots, like the sorceresses cleaning up the mess and the romance between Jaskier and Radovid. The latter is something that I refused to address in my previous posts as it didn’t really affect my viewing experience. But then the scene between them at Aretuza happened and I involuntarily muttered, “why are we focusing on this right now.” Of all the plot points to continue at this time in the story, their romance should not be the priority. It’s also important to note that we already saw a conclusion to their subplot in the previous episode, only for it to be thrown out the window here.

        "body": "DISCLAIMER\\* Before anyone gets on my ass, I would like to make it known that I enjoyed the series for what it is at face value, and my criticism of the writing hasn't got anything to do with \"not following the source material\" so you can all put your pitchforks and torches down.\n\nThe show is written in such a way where emotional pay off is few and far between, and it ruins a lot of things for me as a viewer. Season 2 and 3 are very bogged down by strange decisions that rob what should be very emotionally charged moments of any true meaning whatsoever. The biggest example is of course the decision to kill of Eskel in season 2, a choice that left no impact in any way unless you count pissing people off. Eskel's death served no purpose, not in the episode he died and certainly not on the greater story as a whole, so what need was there to use such a well known and well loved character if their death wouldn't affect anything at all? Making Ciri have to chose between her parents and Geralt at the end of season 2 when at no point has she ever known them, and certainly not enough to make that scene feel like it had any real tension just made it tedious to watch.\n\nAnd now, in season 3 as well. The plotline between Ciri and Cahir was something they all but threw out in season 2, but now suddenly she's all he can think about and dream about? It makes that scene on the cliffs very empty. I thought for the most part that Yen and Ciri's relationship was done well, but then came the \"ugly one\" nickname out of nowhere as if the writer's room suddenly remembered that's how Yen refers to her when they FIRST MEET, and threw it in for a single episode (not even the whole episode either, because she calls her my daughter before it ends). These decisions are head scratching, it's like they did it just to say \"well that was in the books!\". Even Tissaia's death felt empty, and I for one sobbed when she died in the books, so to feel absolutely nothing despite MyAnna's brilliance in the role just speaks volumes. There are more examples, but I think I've covered my grievances. \n\nTLDR: On the surface level, the show works well. It's action packed and it's thrilling and the actors go as far as they can with what they're given. But it misses the emotional beats far too often to ever be more than just surface level entertainment.",

Great casting including triss. \nToss a coin to your witcher! \nHenry as geralt broke my brain, and now when i think about geralt from the books i see him as henry! \nI enjoyed yennefers back story and thought it was obvious that the best episodes were the ones that followed the books.  \nI believed it would be obvious  for the producers and the writers upon reflection too.\n\nAnd then season 2 came out.\nMother***s, what the f***k is this!

It's morning, Ciri is in danger, and Vilgefortz is out there free. He can easily defeat djikstra and his men but he decides to go with them because? Now, Philippa and her gang want to expose Vilgi, is it the best decision really, to hold other mages in chains while they do so? Of course no one believes them. Things go south and Philippa just stands there and watch while ithers fight, and Tissaia can fight her but simply tells her to never come back? Why not kill the traitor? Low budget? OK. Now Vilgi admits to his betrayal, opens a portal, and walks away and she just watches? Their battle would've been really interesting btw.\n\nMoving on to Yen, who leaves Aretuza, and somehow Lydia and Triss just happen to be there too. Lydia was way to easy btw. She finds Ciri, Rience somehow finds them, and omg this has annoyed me for far too long. Just because this guy decides to use fire magic, doesn't mean he has to do every single shit with fire. This the second time he can have Ciri and all he does is create some stupid fire circle around her. And Yen is doing basically nothing as always. The level of magical talent Yen shows in this series is even lower than Geralt's. She broke a guy's neck a few episodes earlier, but all she can manage now is do flying sword shit and geralt just shows up out of goddamn nowhere and kills him. Rience was a major villain and his death is even more stupid and Lydia's. Now Yen goes to Aretuza and tells Triss to look for Geralt because...? Does she know Geralt is fighting Vilgefortz at the same time? No. And Triss does so because...? Any way what's up with Cahir. I liked how he promised Ciri they will meet again and fought the elves for her, because it'll make the future events more reasonable. But what was the whole \"Please kill me I love you\" crap? It was so stupid compared to how he's been during the previous episodes. So inconsistent. Now Geralt is fighting Vilgi and for some reason he doesn't kill Geralt. Then Ciri goes for Tor Lara because...? And Vilgi knows that because...?\n\nAnd please, give Yen something to do with her magic. She's one of the most powerful mages there, and all she does is aard-level magic. Artorious Vigo got more badass magic scenes than Yen. And Francessca, Queen if the elves, one of the greatest sorceresses out there, all she does is break that fire-chandelier thing. Very disappointing. Btw what the hell is Fringilla doing in there? And why kill her uncle?\n\nKorath was nice, but they didn't have to make her say everything out load. We get it. What's going on with Milva btw? She's just... I don't know, not right for some reason. Didn't like her at all. Tissaia's death was book accurate but disappointing anyway. She was not the kind to give up and break so easily. Now, Yen comes to Brokilon, and somehow it doesn't cross their minds that she can teleport geralt to nilfgaard or somewhere closer to it? Really? And what the hell was that \"lead the mages\" crap geralt told Yen to do? So their daughter isn't as important as taking Tissaia's place? And Yen is taking control now? Then she heals him! I mean, of a mage could do it, why take him to Brokilon in the first place.\n\nWorst part is, Emhyr wants Ciri as a daughter, not a wife. How is Geralt supposed to look for Ciri all this time and not find out she's the princess of Nilfgaard? Emhyr wants ciri for her uterus. That's something she must be saved from. Why save a girl who's reunited with her loving father and is titled princess of Cintra and an empire? Yen is somehow not going to know this either, I suppose.

The cast are nothing like the books, but at least this group is about people from different corners of the continent. Diversity is not that big a deal to me at least. And Ciri's fight in the end with that man, the way she was \"playing with him\" was beautifully done.\n\nBtw, I must mention Geralt and Vilgi's fight was perfection.

Regardless, it is his one motivation.  His command stems from being the one tasked to find Ciri, and he has dominion over other Nilfgard troops and generals for this end.\n\nIn Season 2, Cahir is captured and becomes a rogue for most of the season.  At the end, he teams with Fringilla and attempts to regain his favor with Nilfgard only for Emhyr to cast him down from his station.  Not much about Ciri and Cahir this season.\n\nIn Season 3, Cahir regains his station a second time and attempts to ally with the elf queen to...what exactly?  It seems they both want to find Ciri again for their own reasons.  Cahir then actually finds her at Aretuza and...just lets her go.  Why?\n\nedit - I just want to add that Cahir killed his good friend the squirrel leader so that he could continue his hunt for Ciri in the name of his emperor...and then he completely abandons his mission and lets her go.  Why did Cahir murder his good friend?  Is it because he is confused?  Not the smartest tool in the shed?

And of course the overall action, s3 has had some great choreography and there were some obvious highlights here too. Just all in all great, *this* is how good The Witcher can be when it's really working well.",

        "body": "Disclaimer: I have not read the books or played the games, so this opinion is just based on the show.\n\nI finished season 3 the other day, and while in previous seasons I was tepid about Ciri, season 3 has me oscillating between being proud of her and feeling really frustrated, and I think it's the writing.\n\nShe wants to be independent and do some \"normal\" family things, and that's sweet if a little naive. The writers want me to believe this tiny person is a formidable fighter who can hold her own fighting alongside Geralt...sure, I'll suspend disbelief, she's got elven blood or something (although the elves in the show don't seem to be any more formidable than humans).\n\nBut I keep wondering if I'm supposed to be impressed by her or if I'm supposed to feel sorry for her. Yeah, she's had a rough go. So have a lot of people in the world of the Witcher. At least she got to live her first 15 years or so as a fucking princess with very little strife. But then, she's a teenager, she's going to lack perspective, I get it. But the show seems to show her growing in capability and judgment in season 3.\n\nBut then comes episode 7. She's determined, yes, but ultimately shown to be seriously incompetent. I dunno if it's for TV reasons or what, but she literally is getting her face burned off and she still doesn't cover it with the shawl she made. Just her hair. She also can't navigate for shit, and needs rescuing yet again. She's a perpetual damsel, unless she's a Mary Sue. The show can't decide. But she comes across as kind of stupid mixed with angsty, and that just isn't sympathetic.\n\nThe choice to use fire magic should have felt important, and it did, and I was with her to save her friend. But then she seems to realize that it's too dangerous and \"relinquishes her power\"...the fuck does that even mean? Then she's found by some bad people because of course she is, and held hostage. She kills the dude holding her captive because some random gave her a sword and he was trying to kill her. Fine. She doesn't kill Cahir when she has the chance and he literally asks her to, but she kills this dude. Ok. But now, with zero reasons, she turns 180 from her desert epiphany and decides to call herself Falka because....angst? She's been kidnapped and detoured and treated poorly the whole series but this one dude tied her up for a couple days at most (as it reads in the show) and it's enough to tip her whole character towards nihilism?\n\nI don't really care about her. I care that Geralt and Yennefer care about her. Ciri isn't growing up or really maturing in meaningful ways, and that's partly the fault of the adults in her life, but it's also on her. And I just find myself not liking her. I dunno. Maybe the story is going somewhere and I'll change my mind, but right now I honestly don't even care what happens to her.",

Even though I read it in an hour!\n\nAnd I’m reading, you’re not, Barbara!\n\nYou’ll have to understand Okakura’s disdain for the West as back in the 1900s, Westerners were ignorant to Japanese culture so he’s here to mansplain with his tea essay and whiplash you back to your weeb roots. You’ll also read tales that revolve around the philosophy of Teaism, so it almost feels like you’re nested in a short story anthology within a philosophical essay. Although let’s just say you’ll have a new urge to raid your teabag cabinet while reading this book because getting good Sencha is out of the ballpark for you.\n\n**Ö** *Theme:* **Tea Expert Guesses Cheap vs Expensive Tea:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O\\_VsxGdECYI&pp=ygUII3lvb2xvbmc%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_VsxGdECYI&pp=ygUII3lvb2xvbmc%3D) (shlurp, shlurp)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**Elantris**](https://www.amazon.com/Elantris-Tenth-Anniversary-Authors-Definitive/dp/0765381028/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12PG8RCQTC0VA&keywords=elantris&qid=1690826135&sprefix=elantris%2Caps%2C132&sr=8-1) **by Brandon Sanderson**\n\nRead if you have never read anything by Sanderson, which, you didn’t plan on reading anything by him, but this r/ will never let you walk a centimeter in here without mentioning him every other second.So, you have no choice and struggle to understand where the fuck to even start.\n\nHere, start literally with his first novel.\n\nFor the people who throw darts wondering “recommend to me a Dark Souls novel”, *here.* No really, it’s a good start.\n\nWord of warning, compared to his later works which you hear praises for all time, this is not Sanderson’s best work. However, for being a debut, you could have sworn he probably time-warped Tolkien to make this book for him and made it more modern and time-warped him back. Given how Sanderson makes his worlds, I wouldn’t be surprised.\n\nYou also don’t mind ships sailing and sinking harder than current events. And probably one of the best POC characters I’ve read in a while.

The vampire is a tree vampire that now dies like regular people (aka live to be 500) and they start to get 1st world disorder that they’re not living to be 1,000 years old anymore.\n\nThe love interest is the “not like other girls” MC that was enslaved in a sleep drug tower islands that love giant bats. You’ll also get a character called Vintage which is pushed aside most of the time by Edward Cullen and Bella’s relationship.\n\nThough there is a potential Yaoi side ship that happens with Hestillion’s cousin and a Viking guy that I wish fruition in this book. Maybe it’ll happen in the next books. Probably.\n\nYou’re dropped into a world where giant bugs and warped spirits threaten humanity every few centuries. The plot is typical Sword & Sorcery fair, but if Deborah hasn’t read a book since “Twilight”, it’ll be original, so don’t worry.Imagine Dragons is also playing in your head because you can’t leave the Tens decade still and drinking to your lost childhood that was traumatic, so I don’t know why Deborah keeps downing the sake.\n\n**Ö** ***Theme***\\*\\*: Imagine Dragons – Believer:\\*\\* [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wtfhZwyrcc**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wtfhZwyrcc)\n\n***Runner up clip:*** **Ponycraft II: Queen of the Swarm:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cd3PC8uZfU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cd3PC8uZfU)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**Baptism of Fire**](https://www.amazon.com/Baptism-of-Fire-Andrzej-Sapkowski-audiobook/dp/B012DHBZ2Y/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=baptism+of+fire+andrzej+sapkowski&qid=1690826346&sprefix=baptism+of+fire%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-1) **by Andrzej Sapkowski**\n\nRead if the thought of going on an adventure with an unlikely cast of characters is up your alley. A being so powerful he could destroy the world if he wanted to (Dio), a tsundere archer that backs up her smack talk (Monique from Arknights (I know she’s not a tsundere, but work with me), Dandelion, and a sulky Boomer go on an adventure to save Ciri from her bi (or gay) love interest.\n\nAlso, Yennefer got SAO’d Yui’d. If you don’t get it, don’t worry about it.\n\nOnce again, hard to judge the book since it’s part of the series and quality and prose are pretty much the same, but the length of chapters can make you double-take that we were reading “The Fifth Season”. No rocks or cache bread in sight, thank Stillness.\n\nOh, and somewhere in the middle, the women of the wizards want to take real power, which would have been a killer book idea, though Sapkowski didn’t want to focus it on the entire series.\n\nI think he’s fine in his wooden bathtub sipping wine while reading this thinking I’m crazy for making him ever work again.\n\n**Edit:** On looking at his net worth after writing this, apparently there was a licensing issue when he sold the rights of Witcher, and he is sadly not worth as much money as I originally thought. If you want to know more, Google his net worth and you’ll get some idea of what happened.\n\n***Ö*** *Theme*: **JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Opening 2:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcuTPjgMiXw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcuTPjgMiXw)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**I’ve Been Killing Slimes Vol 7**.](https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Slimes-Years-Maxed-Level-ebook/dp/B0827J31JY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=BKJISIUFESJ1&keywords=i%27ve+been+killing+slimes+for+300+years+and+maxed+out+my+level+vol+7&qid=1690826401&sprefix=i%27ve+been+killing+slimes+for+300+years+and+maxed+out+my+level+vol+7%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-1) **By Kisetsu Morita**\n\nRead if you want to have a meta-commentary about gods and immortality. You didn’t expect it as you want a fluffy slice of life isekai then – WHAM! Philosophy on gods and immortality in the latter half. Ignore the part of mushrooms turning people into furries. Not important.\n\nAnd for some reason, we go on a carriage, Amazing Race style in the middle, though it’s fine, it’s based on Pecora’s love of books so you should let it slide. Though you now wish this book series existed because according to the book, there are 40+ of these in the series. If only it was real…\n\nAs I said for “Baptism” hard to judge a series for its individual parts, though it feels like it upped the worldbuilding in this volume. Not because we include a new character, but for the fact it makes you have an existential crisis at 1 AM and you have to raid the fridge for aburaage.\n\nAnd there is none. Fuck.\n\n**Ö** *Theme*: **When an anime opening completely clashes in tone:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud\\_yNZ19A4c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud_yNZ19A4c)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**The Library**](https://www.amazon.com/Library-Librarian-Alexandria-Book-ebook/dp/B08GM27XLY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3S8RYHGOFXCGJ&keywords=the+library+casey+white&qid=1690826469&sprefix=the+library+casey+whit%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-1) **by Casey White:**\n\nRead if you always fantasized about dating the Library of Alexandria. The main character won’t date her sadly and will comment she’s beautiful at a few points in the story. Didn’t think Bibliophila would take it this far, but here we are.\n\nThe book is about if the Library of Alexandria was in someone’s mind rather than physically existing. And what if it had many Librarians over the year to watch over it?\n\nIf you turn your brain off and squint hard, it may be a meta-commentary of the “don’t torch a whole library just because you’re wrapped up in your ideals” type of thing. I’m fucking lookin’ at you, arsonists of Alexandria.\n\nYou won’t find much description about what’s in these books, this book is more focused on the Librarians, not the contents the Library holds. This sucks, because you would want to find the book that may have documented who really found tea in China and what compelled him to eat a leaf. Or where the fuck is damn Atlantis.\n\n**Ö** *Theme:* **I built a bridge**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrXPefXStoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrXPefXStoc)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**The Hollow Places**](https://www.amazon.com/The-Hollow-Places/dp/B084HN1LPH/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+hollow+places&qid=1690826639&sprefix=the+hollow+places%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-1) **by T. Kingfisher**\n\nRead if the thought of taxidermy doesn’t raise questions of how moral it is to display them in a museum with no permits.\n\nBut for real, you will have to question if you’re ok with walking into a portal that exists in the back of the museum. It'll lead you to \"Evil Narnia\".\n\nDo you remember that world between worlds in “Magician’s Nephew”? Now imagine that, with fucked up shit going on. What if the government got involved, what happens when random strangers get in, and why is there a school bus that is an off shade of yellow?!\n\nThings like that.\n\nThe main character is as close of a representation with me, (hates her ex, does art, writes fanfic and reads them, browses forums, and can be petty as shit) that I feel like Kingfisher might be following me around on this r/. (Although, this was published in 2020 and I didn’t write anything here for a long ass time.))\n\nAnyway, it’s two characters that are self-aware and stuck in this creepy world and no amount of deus ex machina is saving them this time. Though this was the book that taught you that coffee laced with alcohol can be a thing, and you thank Simon for his coffee addiction.\n\n***Ö*** *Theme*: **WTF Richard?** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIG0pBQw8X4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIG0pBQw8X4)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Conclusion**: @\n\nI was nearly done with “The Book That Wouldn’t Burn”, but been bombarded with heat stroke, cats not deciding if they wanted to be in a room or not, depression, and a dollop of family drama.

Even though I read it in an hour!\n\nAnd I’m reading, you’re not, Barbara!\n\nYou’ll have to understand Okakura’s disdain for the West as back in the 1900s, Westerners were ignorant to Japanese culture so he’s here to mansplain with his tea essay and whiplash you back to your weeb roots. You’ll also read tales that revolve around the philosophy of Teaism, so it almost feels like you’re nested in a short story anthology within a philosophical essay. Although let’s just say you’ll have a new urge to raid your teabag cabinet while reading this book because getting good Sencha is out of the ballpark for you.\n\n**Ö** *Theme:* **Tea Expert Guesses Cheap vs Expensive Tea:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O\\_VsxGdECYI&pp=ygUII3lvb2xvbmc%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_VsxGdECYI&pp=ygUII3lvb2xvbmc%3D) (shlurp, shlurp)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**Elantris**](https://www.amazon.com/Elantris-Tenth-Anniversary-Authors-Definitive/dp/0765381028/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12PG8RCQTC0VA&keywords=elantris&qid=1690826135&sprefix=elantris%2Caps%2C132&sr=8-1) **by Brandon Sanderson**\n\nRead if you have never read anything by Sanderson, which, you didn’t plan on reading anything by him, but this r/ will never let you walk a centimeter in here without mentioning him every other second.So, you have no choice and struggle to understand where the fuck to even start.\n\nHere, start literally with his first novel.\n\nFor the people who throw darts wondering “recommend to me a Dark Souls novel”, *here.* No really, it’s a good start.\n\nWord of warning, compared to his later works which you hear praises for all time, this is not Sanderson’s best work. However, for being a debut, you could have sworn he probably time-warped Tolkien to make this book for him and made it more modern and time-warped him back. Given how Sanderson makes his worlds, I wouldn’t be surprised.\n\nYou also don’t mind ships sailing and sinking harder than current events. And probably one of the best POC characters I’ve read in a while.

The vampire is a tree vampire that now dies like regular people (aka live to be 500) and they start to get 1st world disorder that they’re not living to be 1,000 years old anymore.\n\nThe love interest is the “not like other girls” MC that was enslaved in a sleep drug tower islands that love giant bats. You’ll also get a character called Vintage which is pushed aside most of the time by Edward Cullen and Bella’s relationship.\n\nThough there is a potential Yaoi side ship that happens with Hestillion’s cousin and a Viking guy that I wish fruition in this book. Maybe it’ll happen in the next books. Probably.\n\nYou’re dropped into a world where giant bugs and warped spirits threaten humanity every few centuries. The plot is typical Sword & Sorcery fair, but if Deborah hasn’t read a book since “Twilight”, it’ll be original, so don’t worry.Imagine Dragons is also playing in your head because you can’t leave the Tens decade still and drinking to your lost childhood that was traumatic, so I don’t know why Deborah keeps downing the sake.\n\n**Ö** ***Theme***\\*\\*: Imagine Dragons – Believer:\\*\\* [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wtfhZwyrcc**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wtfhZwyrcc)\n\n***Runner up clip:*** **Ponycraft II: Queen of the Swarm:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cd3PC8uZfU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cd3PC8uZfU)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**Baptism of Fire**](https://www.amazon.com/Baptism-of-Fire-Andrzej-Sapkowski-audiobook/dp/B012DHBZ2Y/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=baptism+of+fire+andrzej+sapkowski&qid=1690826346&sprefix=baptism+of+fire%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-1) **by Andrzej Sapkowski**\n\nRead if the thought of going on an adventure with an unlikely cast of characters is up your alley. A being so powerful he could destroy the world if he wanted to (Dio), a tsundere archer that backs up her smack talk (Monique from Arknights (I know she’s not a tsundere, but work with me), Dandelion, and a sulky Boomer go on an adventure to save Ciri from her bi (or gay) love interest.\n\nAlso, Yennefer got SAO’d Yui’d. If you don’t get it, don’t worry about it.\n\nOnce again, hard to judge the book since it’s part of the series and quality and prose are pretty much the same, but the length of chapters can make you double-take that we were reading “The Fifth Season”. No rocks or cache bread in sight, thank Stillness.\n\nOh, and somewhere in the middle, the women of the wizards want to take real power, which would have been a killer book idea, though Sapkowski didn’t want to focus it on the entire series.\n\nI think he’s fine in his wooden bathtub sipping wine while reading this thinking I’m crazy for making him ever work again.\n\n**Edit:** On looking at his net worth after writing this, apparently there was a licensing issue when he sold the rights of Witcher, and he is sadly not worth as much money as I originally thought. If you want to know more, Google his net worth and you’ll get some idea of what happened.\n\n***Ö*** *Theme*: **JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Opening 2:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcuTPjgMiXw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcuTPjgMiXw)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**I’ve Been Killing Slimes Vol 7**.](https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Slimes-Years-Maxed-Level-ebook/dp/B0827J31JY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=BKJISIUFESJ1&keywords=i%27ve+been+killing+slimes+for+300+years+and+maxed+out+my+level+vol+7&qid=1690826401&sprefix=i%27ve+been+killing+slimes+for+300+years+and+maxed+out+my+level+vol+7%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-1) **By Kisetsu Morita**\n\nRead if you want to have a meta-commentary about gods and immortality. You didn’t expect it as you want a fluffy slice of life isekai then – WHAM! Philosophy on gods and immortality in the latter half. Ignore the part of mushrooms turning people into furries. Not important.\n\nAnd for some reason, we go on a carriage, Amazing Race style in the middle, though it’s fine, it’s based on Pecora’s love of books so you should let it slide. Though you now wish this book series existed because according to the book, there are 40+ of these in the series. If only it was real…\n\nAs I said for “Baptism” hard to judge a series for its individual parts, though it feels like it upped the worldbuilding in this volume. Not because we include a new character, but for the fact it makes you have an existential crisis at 1 AM and you have to raid the fridge for aburaage.\n\nAnd there is none. Fuck.\n\n**Ö** *Theme*: **When an anime opening completely clashes in tone:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud\\_yNZ19A4c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud_yNZ19A4c)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**The Library**](https://www.amazon.com/Library-Librarian-Alexandria-Book-ebook/dp/B08GM27XLY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3S8RYHGOFXCGJ&keywords=the+library+casey+white&qid=1690826469&sprefix=the+library+casey+whit%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-1) **by Casey White:**\n\nRead if you always fantasized about dating the Library of Alexandria. The main character won’t date her sadly and will comment she’s beautiful at a few points in the story. Didn’t think Bibliophila would take it this far, but here we are.\n\nThe book is about if the Library of Alexandria was in someone’s mind rather than physically existing. And what if it had many Librarians over the year to watch over it?\n\nIf you turn your brain off and squint hard, it may be a meta-commentary of the “don’t torch a whole library just because you’re wrapped up in your ideals” type of thing. I’m fucking lookin’ at you, arsonists of Alexandria.\n\nYou won’t find much description about what’s in these books, this book is more focused on the Librarians, not the contents the Library holds. This sucks, because you would want to find the book that may have documented who really found tea in China and what compelled him to eat a leaf. Or where the fuck is damn Atlantis.\n\n**Ö** *Theme:* **I built a bridge**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrXPefXStoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrXPefXStoc)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**The Hollow Places**](https://www.amazon.com/The-Hollow-Places/dp/B084HN1LPH/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+hollow+places&qid=1690826639&sprefix=the+hollow+places%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-1) **by T. Kingfisher**\n\nRead if the thought of taxidermy doesn’t raise questions of how moral it is to display them in a museum with no permits.\n\nBut for real, you will have to question if you’re ok with walking into a portal that exists in the back of the museum. It'll lead you to \"Evil Narnia\".\n\nDo you remember that world between worlds in “Magician’s Nephew”? Now imagine that, with fucked up shit going on. What if the government got involved, what happens when random strangers get in, and why is there a school bus that is an off shade of yellow?!\n\nThings like that.\n\nThe main character is as close of a representation with me, (hates her ex, does art, writes fanfic and reads them, browses forums, and can be petty as shit) that I feel like Kingfisher might be following me around on this r/. (Although, this was published in 2020 and I didn’t write anything here for a long ass time.))\n\nAnyway, it’s two characters that are self-aware and stuck in this creepy world and no amount of deus ex machina is saving them this time. Though this was the book that taught you that coffee laced with alcohol can be a thing, and you thank Simon for his coffee addiction.\n\n***Ö*** *Theme*: **WTF Richard?** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIG0pBQw8X4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIG0pBQw8X4)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Conclusion**: @\n\nI was nearly done with “The Book That Wouldn’t Burn”, but been bombarded with heat stroke, cats not deciding if they wanted to be in a room or not, depression, and a dollop of family drama.

Obviously this is all my opinion but this are some additions I enjoyed:\n\n* Framing Stregabor - This is a GREAT way to use this character who was only around for one short story, and didn't really have much to do in the show besides be a mustache twirling racist. I think its a great misdirect for people who haven't read the books.\n* Vilgefortz and Tissaia de Vries as lovers - I think this is a great way to get inside the mind of Vilgefortz prior to his betrayal at Thanedd. I also think really works in how it contributes to Tissia's mental state AFTER the coup and leads to her suicide. She not only failed the brotherhood but was intimately betrayed. It gives Vilgefortz more status as an evil mastermind and manipulator.\n* Fake Ciri is a Vilgefortz experiment -  Aside from some questionable CGI this episode does some great setup of Vilgefortz's evil plans. In the book this character was just a commoner but it makes sense that she was targeted by Vilgefortz for her faint elven heritage and by Emyr for her resemblance to Ciri. Its a great bridge across different story lines that makes sense.\n* Ciri's visions of Falka - The desert episode is very similar to its portrayal in the novel but adds in visions of Falka narrating a possible future for Ciri as a monstrous tyrant. The series has never been great about giving backstory and characters like Falka that only exist in the lore usually get brushed over. Giving this character a voice and screen presence was a great choice\n\nHonestly I think season 3 made some smart moves with the set up it had, but suffers from most of the problems that each of these seasons has. Going forward I think it will be tough to invent things for some characters to do. Characters like Yennefer and Fringilla will have a long stretch of the story where there isn't much material from the books to adapt for them and their plotlines will have to be invented from whole cloth.\n\nI don't love everything from this season but I think this was as close as we might get to a satisfactory adaptation. Plus man the costumes and wigs were waaay less distracting this go around.",

        "title": "Venting about season three (Ughhhh) (Thorough spoilers of show and books)",
        "body": "I am a huge fan of the books and have not been the harshest critic of the show. I have tried to look on the positives within the show until now but since this was possibly the last season here I go!\n\nStarting with positives, there are two episodes i enjoy. I enjoy the prelude to the coup on Thanedd. I think the mystery and Red Herring are well executed and despite being quite far from the books it is enjoyable and not too badly written. My biggest critique of the episode would be costumes(especially Yenn's since it's a tad too simplistic for what i could see Yenn wearing but that's a bit of a nitpick).\n\nAnother episode I liked was the one right after the coup on Thanedd, where Ciri walks through the desert, meets little horse and renounces her magical abilities. It follows what happens in the books pretty faithfully, although perhaps there wasn't that much to change. The one thing they do change feels very cliche and that's Pavetta and Calanthe appearing as hallusinations. In the books, her visions in the fire were also far more severe. She sees all those who she could ever have considered her loved ones on stakes and on gallows and it is way more hard hitting than what the show shows. The visions through fire isn't all that bad, once again I'm more just nitpicking.\n\nThe two original songs go hard. The ride of the witcher and A little sacrifice are easily the best thing in season three. \n\nSome miscellaneous things i liked were the limited depiction of the rats, the acting and casting as well as Geralts new outfits. Also Sabrina's rack.\n\nNow to the negatives. \n\nWHY DID THEY KILL RIENCE HALF-WAY THROUGH THE SEASON!?\n\nHe dies in the second to last book. It feels like in the show they felt like they need to give the main characters a win, but Thanedd is supposed to be a low point. Geralt is crippled, Yennefer is turned to a jade statuette on a shelf and Ciri is lost. \n\nThe payoff to The art of illusion, ep 5 is just very all over the place with the only positive being the call back to Applegat and the undelivered message. The fight between the Scoia'tael and mages is quite boring and goes nowhere, it feels like Geralt, Ciri and Yenn are running in a circle outside the school and them separating feels very forced. Tissaia's suicide feels very clumsy and again, forced. the drama between mages is just not really there even though they try and the whole coup is very anticlimactic. Also Filavandrel's death honestly was more funny than anything. The show's handling of Lydia is also just all over the place and flavourless, she seems more like Bellatrix from harry potter.\n\nAnother problem i have is that Vilgefortz feels like Emhyr's pawn, not a scheming, evil mage. He also knows that Emhyr is Duni, why would he bring the false Ciri to him in person!? With Rience dead and Schirru not even in the show I wonder what the plan even was for Vilgefortz if there was one. \n\nThe CGI budget must have gone down along with choreography because both seem to have gone down hill for this season. Same with the wardrobe since some characters have very fancy and cool costumes whereas Ciri, Yenn and others have very mundane ones.\n\nYennefer not being a statuette does not work. In the books as soon as she is freed, she feverishly searches for Ciri with barely any other priorities. She does in a few months what took Geralt around a year. Now in the show, her being with the other sorceresses it feels like she is just standing around without taking action.\n\nCiri just casually killing also bugs me in the season, since Ciri deliberately does not kill anyone in the books before joining the rats. She does not kill any elves in Shaerrawedd and her finally having to kill when out on her own is a very concrete sign of her childish innocence(that she still has in the books) fading and her having to grow up whether she is ready to or not, which in it's self is a part of Ciri's character.\n\nThen finally some miscellaneous things I didn't like. The first episode feels kinda pointless, they removed the \"my friend\" joke from it's context and it is no longer funny. Because of the lack of actual drama between sorceresses, i don't see Fringilla and Francesca joining the lodge, especially since Filavandrel was killed by Tissaia and the whole storyline of the lodge just won't work as well. It's implied that Milva is a dryad in the show, which also just isn't a thing in the books. Also they introduce Milva as if the audience is supposed to know her and as if she already had some kind of relationship with Geralt, which she does not have. Cahir's premature redemption arc wanna be also just springs out of nowhere.\n\nTL:DR Show bad... why bad? Very bad. ",

        "body": "Specifically, Tissaia turning failed students into eels, which season 3 seems to confirm, with a line from Fabio, is a standard practice at Aretuza. I haven’t seen much discussion around it, so I’m wondering if it’s just me personally that finds it monumentally more disturbing than how the show actually presents it (almost like it is of little consequence).\n\nIf I am understanding it correctly, Aretuza turns the young girls in their care into living batteries for the school if they don’t show enough potential? They take them from their homes, trick them, then take away their free will and sentience to act as magical conduits for the remainder of their lives. Or maybe they actually maintain their sentience? In which case they are being condemned to a sort of living hell. Worse than just killing them outright. I dunno, I think it is all sorts of screwed up.\n\nCorrect me if I’m wrong, but I don’t recall the books or games mentioning anything about this. It feels more like it was thrown in there for the sake of being dark, but they didn’t consider how morally hypocritical it paints some of the characters. \n\nI am not necessarily referring to Tissaia when I say this. I am only a few episodes into season 3, but I’m getting the impression that there is something up with Tissaia, considering how much effort the show seems to be putting toward convincing me she is a good guy. But Yennefer is clearly aware of it and still idolizes Tissaia AND wants to take Ciri there. I assume Triss is aware of it too if she is teaching at Aretuza. I’d like to believe that neither of them, especially with Triss being portrayed as so stoic, would allow something like that to continue or play any part in it. \n\nI always thought that scene was really horrifying in its implications, so it bothers me that the show made it seem so trivial. Now that Fabio and Ciri brought it back up in season 3, all of those thoughts are going through my head again…",

        "title": "Ciri in the desert episode",
        "body": "Let’s do this. \n\nI’ve seen a lot of criticism for the Ciri in the desert episode. And I’ve seen a lot of criticism for the show not following the books.\n\nAs a person who played the game (Witcher 3) plus read some books (needed a break after Lady of The Lake started), I find that this episode is closest to the source material.\n\nSo for the people complaining, I want to explain why I like that episode. (When I say like, I mean mildly. This last season is a disaster and we all know it, we’ve all said it. Let’s not dwell on that anymore). It shows the following:\n\n\n1. Ciri is a survivor. She drinks dew and eats bugs.\n\n\n2. Ciri is a virgin. This is not explained in the show (because these writers are so awful), but unicorns only appear to virgin girls as per the lord in the books. She has, so far, been an innocent girl running away from danger. \n\n\n3. Ciri’s trauma is getting to her. The visions of Falka, Calanthe and Pavetta show a moral degradation. She starts off saying I’ve got to find G and Y. But her hallucinations are telling her that they’re better off without them.\n\n\n4. Ciri is a Witcher. Again this is not shown properly in the show but the idea that she is able to kill a monster despite being depraved is a very Witcher thing. There’s a theme till now of - what are Ciri’s powers (which we still don’t know). Is she a great swords fighter or a mage? A princess or a elf? This clearly establishes the impact of Geralt on her. She is a Witcher (even though she hasn’t gone through the mutations) in spirit.\n\n\n5. Ciri is no longer a mage. She relinquishes her power. Again shown poorly, but Ciri has basically given up her magic entirely. That’s why when she’s back in civilisation, she doesn’t use the locket to call Yennefer. She can’t.\n\n\n6. Ciri is no longer innocent. This is the arc we see in this episode (as in the books). She started off looking for G and Y. She faces unbearable heat, loneliness, hunger, thirst. By the time she meets the Rats, she’s no longer the young girl we met at first. She kills a man for the first time and her innocence is now gone forever. This is why she says her name is Falka. It’s almost like she no longer wants to be Ciri - the hunted, the lost, the royal. She wants to be the hunter, the independent, the Rat. Minor spoiler: We see a very different Ciri from here on out in the books.\n\nSo I thought the episode tried to do that. Now of course, with show runners so terrible if it didn’t come across then I don’t blame anyone. But I felt like it was the first time (since season 1) they at least tried to show what was on the page instead of all that Voleth Meir nonsense. Hence I mildly liked the episode.\n\nThoughts?",

        "title": "Your five best and five worst things about the Show",
        "body": "Listen, I hate the show as much as the next person here. But I can't deny that there are things in here that are so strangely good, I wanted to acknowledge them. So feel free to make your own list!\n\nFive best things:\n\n1. Music in Season 1. The games (not W2) always had amazing scores. The atmosphere in W1 was largely conveyed by Pawel Blaszczak is still what set the tone for me, even throughout reading the books. Not to mention the track for the first w3 gameplay trailer at e3, the amazing tracks in w3s main game, the eery Gaunter Theme in HoS, the beautiful atmosphere in Toussaint. Some parts of the music of the show reach that.\n\n2. The fight scences. Witcher never was about combat for me, thats why I still prefer some parts of w1 to w2 and w3. I also dislike most shows and movies where there is a lot of fighting. Mostly it's done relativly lazy, doesn't advance the plot or story, doesn't give us something about the characters and could just be skipped over. Not so with this. First fight in Blaviken was staged so well, that I couldn't stopped watching. Even after so many shit episodes, no coherent characters, no caring about any of that shit, fights still are done well enough to keep me watching. I don't even know what they did to make that happen. \n\n3. Some of the casting. I don't think Cavill is a part of that, I don't particularly like him as Geralt, even though he aint bad. Batey as Jaskier/Dandelion is fantastic. Its such a shame they didn't do anthing with him after season 1, except give him the worst haircut ever devised. Other high points to me are Cahir, Buring as De Vries and McTavish as Sigi. He may not look like in the books or games, but I feel with a decent script and direction, MgTavish would have been an amzingly disgusting and imposing Dijkstra. Honorable mention, Kristofer Hivju as Nivellen was absolutely fantastic and succeeded in making me excited for the second season before it all came crashing down with drunk russian vesemir. \n\n4. The fact that its not okay but really bad and severly hated. As a long time witcher fan I was scared it would do to me as it did with things like star wars or the hobbit. I feel either you make something so great that it's as good as its source material, so you can be a genuin fan of the new mass media piece (like the LOTR movies), or it's as bad as this and you can dissociate. If it's in between, then a million normies without any taste love it, its everywhere, and it ruins your perception of the old good stuff. This doesn't happen here, it is literally so bad that my brain doesn't even register it as witcher media, and I don't have to talk to people casually about the witcher at work or family gatherings and need to point out how bad it is. Thats not fun. Lauren spared us that.\n\n5. Sapkovski made a lot of money and probably likes the games much more now maybe. I count that as a positive. Maybe if CDPR makes another witcher universe game at some point, its even more of a success than witcher 3. That would also be great.\n\nI realize I was reaching at some point and felt like I'm doing a Mr Plinkett Review of the The Witcher the Show. \n\nNow to the bad stuff:\n\n1. The writing is just so bad on so many levels, one would need to make a whole video essay about explaining just the basics. I hope someone does at some point. Dan Olson had a great video about why editing in Suicide Squad is the worst hes ever seen, something like that would be great.\n\n2. The Casting we all mentioned. I don't even have a problem with all the diversity casting. The problem isn't its diverse, the problem is its all bad. The script, direction, editting is all bad, so idk if these people have better material in them but man some choices are baffeling. Lars Mikkelsen as Stregobor is the worst for me, Vesemirs casting is without words, I have no idea how this happened. Fringilla is also a horrible choice, but so is Vizimir, Moussack, even Yarpen. I take an indian vilgefortz and black istredd over these jokers any day of the week. How did Netflix assemble this team is beyond me.\n\n3. Art direction / atmosphere\nI think adaptionwise witcher 1 did this best. Vizima and her outskirts, Murky Waters, there was just so much design in there that gave it an amzing sense of place. It made me feel like the old town of my city probably used to look like this, and life probably was like this a thousand years before I was born (minus the monsters and magic). Witcher 3 had that as well, especially in Oxenfurt and Toussaint. Everything felt distinct, real and thoughtful. Nothing about the costumes, the architecture, the set design feels thoughtful in the show. It looks like midjourney spit out \"sets for medieval fantasy show\". The only things that feel alright are when theyy realized how bad they are at their job and just mimic the games, like with cahirs armour. Thats the biggest reason why everything, every second of the show, felt empty to me. It just didn't look like it was a place, it looked like it was a generic set. Because it was.\n\n\n5. The structure has to be pointed out specifically again. I am a person who read all seven books twice, played the first game about 9 times, 2 one about 4 times and third one about 6 times. I read trivia and wikis. Granted, the reading part has been ten years ago, but still, I don't come from nothing. I don't remeber anything that happened plot-wise in the first three seasons except for the short story first episodes of the first episodes in season one and two. It's so poorly structured that my mind cannot keep track of what is happening. What happened in Season 2? idk they went to kaer morhen at some point I think, what happened in season three that I just watched? I don't remember they went to thanedd at some point and Ciri went into Tor Lara and also Elves did things? It's just, man Idk how this happened. It's not that I remember most things that happened in the pentalogy, plot wise, but I remember enough that I should have an easier time than most people coming fresh towards it to have it refresh my memory and go \"oh right, its this story line now\". That literally never happened. You really need to fuck up amazingly to be this bad. Which, I still think is a good thing.\n\nBut yeah thats my list. Feel free to comment.",

I don't hold this against The Witcher franchise whatsoever because I trust that the show did NOT live up to the books or games at all, just based on what basically everyone has said for years now. I did find the show 'entertaining enough' most of the time which is why I kept watching.\n\nDespite the shows bad reputation, it does seem like people generally appreciated Cavill as Geralt? I liked his performance however I am curious if he was too often... soft? Maybe I am COMPLETELY wrong about that. As I've said I haven't read the books or played the games much but my surface-level understanding of Geralt was that he didn't have much of a soft side. If he is a more complex character then maybe I owe Cavill more credit because he did seem to perform Geralt as a complex character.\n\nJust curious what the general consensus is in terms of Cavill's portrayal of Geralt during his 3 seasons on the show.",

        "title": "Geralt vs. Vilgefortz Scene Analysis",
        "body": "I've already invested a lot more time in this TV show than I'd want to, but given how much this book series means to me and how badly I wanted the show to be good, I might as well say my final peace.\n\nI figured that instead of focusing on the more obvious flaws, I'll talk a bit about arguably the best scene in episode 6, the showdown between Vilgefortz and Geralt.\n\nFirst of all, the fight scene was truly great. There are only some minor narrative issues with it. In the books, Vilgefortz bested Geralt without the overt use of magic, which made the scene even more shocking, because the reader witnessed multiple times, the impressive manner in which White Wolf dispatched multiple groups of skilled mercenaries. That's why two instances in which Vilgefortz uses magic - to deflect the Aard sign, and use his own version of it - stem from not understanding the fact, that Vilgefortz beating Geratl with just an iron staff, was actually a deliberate narrative choice. Also, in the first book, Triss points out that Witcher's Aard is primitive in comparison to what a wizard can do with a similar spell, so if the writers really wanted to showcase Vilgefortz's might, they might as well show that (though magic in the show has much bigger issues with how unimpressive other wizards were in the same episode, and how inconsistent the rules of magic are).\n\nNow, this is not that big of a deal, easily excusable in the context of visual medium. Furthermore, even though Vilgefortz was a skilled mercenary before becoming a wizard, it is implied that both his staff and his capabilities are indeed magically enhanced, and that's why he was able to dispatch Geralt so easily. Also, the staff does indeed materialize in his hand at the start of the duel, so taking that to the extreme and making it able to teleport during the fight was actually a brilliant decision on the part of either the writer or the fight coordinator. Bravo. Again, narratively, this might be slightly messing with the choice the author made, but this is exactly the kind of thing that could enhance the show in the context of a new medium at a slight cost to the book accuracy.\n\nI'm sure most new and old fans (baring a small subset of people you can never please) would be happy with book inaccuracies that enhance the story or, at the very least, are \"viable choices\". Unfortunately, instead of that, we got a bunch of changes that made the show much worse than sticking with the books would've been.\n\nEven though much of the dialogue was ripped straight out of the books in this one, the omissions and additions are to the show's detriment. Here are a few examples.\n\n1)\"Do you like my staff\" reads like a line written by a 16-year-old and approved by a 14-year-old. It's completely incompatible with the character. If the writers wanted to bring the viewers' attention to the iron staff (which, in the books, is conveyed via Geralt's thoughts), the sound cue and the staff slowly materializing in Vilgefortz's hand were more than enough. Anything beyond that is condescending to the viewer in the context of a visual medium.\n\nAt best, this is just a dumb joke. At worst, it's a poor attempt at \"deconstructing\" the showdown between a hero and a villain by implying it's a \"dick measuring contest\". That was not needed. Vilgefortz already deconstructed the banality of \"final battle against good and evil\" in the books in a much more elegant way. Geralt added to that by sincerely hoping that Phillipa would be a part of the final showdown and not him.\n\n2) There's quite a bit of talk about politics and intrigue during the pre-fight conversation in the books. Now, scrapping that was probably a good choice for a TV show... if all of it was well explained in the rest of the episode (it wasn't). Instead, we got Vilgefortz visibly annoyed, insecurely stating: \"I have no strings!\" when accused of being Emhyr's puppet. Compare that with a measured, calm, book response to a similar accusation:\n\n\"You're shooting widely. What if I told you that Emhyr is my tool?\" - wouldn't that be a touch more menacing?\n\n3) In the books, Vilgefortz doesn't have to state on two separate occasions that he was \"holding back\". His power up until that point was only implied (he was a young, extremely talented member of the Council who got that place by leading other wizards during the battle of Sodden Hill), and made shockingly self-evident during the fight. The mystery worked much better, than the stupid \"bait and switch\" of writers diminishing him by making him lose a fight with Cahir back in season one.\n\nConsider the book quote: \"I have no desire to kill you, I kill with reluctance\" vs. what basically amounted to the immature \"I could've killed everyone all the time, but I was holding back because... reasons\"?   Why was he holding back, exactly? The fact that Wizards are powerful is obvious in the books. Every member of the chapter can, obviously, easily \"take any life, at any time\" (at lest in the case of 99% of the human/monster population, it gets more tricky once they meet their match). Well, maybe not the show wizards because their power is inconsistent, all over the place, and not very impressive.\n\n4) Despite the aforementioned claims by the TV show's Vilgefortz that he'd very much like to do a lot of killing, but didn't because \"reasons\", at this point in the story, Vilgefortz is not yet painted as an unhinged sociopath.  He sounds like a good villain is supposed to - borderline reasonable. Instead of some generic remarks, about him and Geralt, both being \"smart\" and \"warriors touched by magic\", he made him a somewhat attractive offer. Vilgefortz claimed that he just wanted to help Ciri fulfil her destiny as the child of Elder Blood, and Geralt can simply join him, and be at Ciri's side throughout the whole process.\n\nGeralt only manages to throw Vilgefortz off balance by seeing through this \"too good to be true\" proposal. He mentioned that Lydia - an artist that loved Vilgefortz platonically - proved to be a tool that mage willingly sacrificed. So instead of the sociopathic \"I could've killed everyone all the time!\", Vilgefortz actually felt or acted like he felt some remorse. That, in turn, made him angry. Geralt also indicated that Vilgefortz's willingness to sacrifice Lydia is the reason why he can't really trust this fairy tale scenario in which Vilgefortz allows Geralt to accompany Ciri as she fulfils her destiny. This is what ultimately triggers the fight both of them were reluctant to take part in.\n\nAll very logical, based on plot points that the readers can evaluate for themselves. It doesn't work in the show, of course, because show-Lydia was a moustache twirling henchmen. Her face disfigurement, which in the books was only visible to everyone once she died, was used in the show to portray her as a monster. A low blow, greatly simplifying this tragic character.\n\n\\----------\n\nI'm writing this post for the benefit of people who haven't read the books, wondering where the hate or disappointment from the more reasonable book readers comes from. I purposefully started with the things the scene arguably or objectively improved, because that was indeed possible for the entire show. The often mentioned \"book accuracy\" is misunderstood. The Witcher books have some fat on them that could've been trimmed. Some parts could've been changed and adjusted to benefit the story in a new medium. Instead, we got a bunch of chaotic, immature, reductive, and often strictly worse versions of the book plot points.",

        "title": "Season 3 has been my favourite so far",
        "body": "Big Witcher fan here. Like most played Witcher 3 which led me to read the books and then led me to the show. Enjoyed all the seasons, but Season 3 was a lot of fun for me. This is mostly just a collection of ramblings.\n\nI know the producer has said Time of Contempt is her favourite book of the lot and it's the one I reread least because it's the most depressing and the ending is rather... urrrr... ewww. It felt really satisfying to see the past two and half seasons lead to the confrontation on Thaned and the revelation of Vilgerfortz. The slow buildup of the first half of the season was appreciated as was homage to Season of Storms with the cave in epsiode two.\n\nEnjoyed the fights, the extra time Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri had together compared to the books, and the monsters. The desert episode was fantastic as well as it showed Ciri battling abandonment issues and the risk of fire magic. \n\nI also excited for the next season. Baptism of Fire is my favourite book and the Tower of the Swallow has my favourite scene in the entire series (I wonder how the battle of the ice will be without Rience?) As we'll get lots more of the dynamic duo of Geralt and Jaskier along with their Hanse. \n\nYennefer has had the best treatment overall. She's gotten much more screentime then she had pages in the book where she basically got turned into a statue at Thaned and only appeared halfway through Baptism of Fire. I wonder how the Lodge will be formed? Phillipa vs Yennefer seems most likely. I hope Anya gets good work from her breakout Performance on the show.\n\nI'm also curious where Radovid will go. Book Radovid is basically nonexistant until the very end where he has some grumpy teenage thoughts about missing out on the glory so making him Visimr's brother and having a clever, but listless temperment worked well for me. \n\nSome gripes:\n\n* I think Dijkstra and Phillipa are a bit too cavalier in their murdering in the Redanian court, though by the end Dijkstra also seems to have grasped that.\n* The eyeliner on the men isn't to my taste, but that's very subjective. \n* Cahir's finale was satisfying for me, but his road there with his eleven buddy was strange on reflection. Happy to give his motivations a pass for this season since they weren't explained until the penultimate book. But yeah, murder tour elf so you can seek forgiveness of Ciri seemed like a weird road.\n* Milva, love her in the books, but for now don't have much to go on. Her acting seems a bit out of place, like she is from lands far away. Not sure what her dynamic with the others will be, though it was usually pulling others out of the fire. Gripe, but reserving judgement.\n\nI'm looking forwards to future seasons, but am sad to see Henry Cavil go. Enjoyed his performance and sword swinging even if he talks much less than book Geralt. Think that was a strength given the medium. Do more, say less. Best of luck to Hemsworth!\n\nWhat were your thoughts? What did you like? What didn't you like? Why?",

Would there even be enough soldiers in the North to take back Cintra and conquer Nazair for example? Because all they do is sit around and take the beating from Nilfgaard all the time, every time there is a conflict the North goes defensive. Now I get it, they're a bunch of very different states who hate each other, but what if they unite specifically to take the fight to Nilfgaard? \n\nImagine a scenario somewhere before the Third War: Foltest crosses the Yaruga with Temerian, Lyrian, Aedirnian, Kaedwenian and Redanian forces combined, going for Cintra and beyond. How far can he go into Nilfgaard's territory before being stopped? Suppose the Northern intel managed to fool Nilfgaardians into thinking that the main strike will come from Lyria, so Foltest has an element of surprise. How far can he go?",

I would like to start by saying that i’ve never played the game nor have i read the book, so i have zero knowledge about the source material, but i am a fan of the show, or WAS a fan.  \n\nI just finished watching volume 2 of season 3 and my god, i was left fuming! \n\nFirst of all, how long are they gonna drag out the “Find Ciri, Lose Ciri” storyline?! Will we seeing more of this boring shit in season 4. Quite frankly, i have zero interest in continuing! I now understand why Henry Cavill left the show!\n\nI enjoyed the first part of season 3, i thought it would culminate to something good for the show and maybe for Henry Cavill to go out with a bang! But it did not and he did not. I was left feeling puzzled and empty after episode 8.\n\nEpisode 6 - The fall of Aretuza. Wtf was that?! The writing was terrible! It felt like a cheesy B-grade film writing. It was anti-climactic. Tissaia doing the “powerful” thunder spell, only to kill a handful of soldiers. What a waste! When she started the spell, i was like “oh shit! This is it!” ..and then i was like “huh? That’s it??”\n\nEpisode 7 - What even is that?! 30+ mins of Ciri in the desert and it led to absolutely nothing! For her to become like Falka? I’m no writer, but surely there are better ways to make it engaging for the audience and not make them want to fall asleep trying to get to the end! (I’m starting to get bored of her now! Anyone else feels the same way??) \n\nEpisode 8 - Firstly, why did the writers have to do Tissaia dirty like that?! One of the most powerful mages in the show calling it quits by committing suicide because she felt like a failure for her poor taste of judgment in men?! Was it meant to be a poetic death or something? Because if the writers meant her to go down that route, well, it fell flat and plain useless. \n\nSecondly, they wasted so much time focusing on useless scenes not suitable for a final episode! The forest scene took too long imo. Wasted so much of Henry Cavill’s final moments in the show. \n\nThirdly, here we go again, back to square one; losing Ciri and finding Ciri! I don’t need to elaborate further. But, enough is enough! \n\nHonestly, they should just rename this show to “Finding Ciri”! \n\n😤\nBORED. DISAPPOINTED. DONE WITH THIS TRAINWRECK.",

        "body": "I've honestly enjoyed most of this season until Episodes 6 and 7. Mostly I just have questions and complaints because some things were just...insanely bizarre.\n\n1). The mages who killed thousands at Sodden are defeated by 50 Elven soldiers, deus ex Fringilla, and Mr. I Lost the Battle of Sodden aka Cahir?\n\n2). Tissaia, the most powerful and terrifying mage on the continent, unleashes the power of lightning which is supposed to be a big badass move and it kills 2 soldiers and barely inconveniences Francesca.\n\n3). Stregabor shows up and saves the day, nevermind all of his previous racism, he's a hero now!\n\n4). The mages are seen sad and mourning while watching their home burn at the end of episode 6...but when episode 7 starts they're back inside Aretuza. Did they lose or not?\n\n5). Yen and Geralt killing Rience I actually enjoyed, was a cool move.\n\n6). Geralt got a few broken bones, why is he dying now? Also Vilgefortz didn't drag his body into the ocean so why was he drowning? How did they get him to the forest in like 5 minutes?\n\n7). Jaskiers love fling with the prince feels odd and forced. Like dude he just tried to kidnap your goddaughter, do not fall in love with him.\n\n8). Why does Cahir feel bad for Cirri? How did he and the other elves escape that battle when they were pinned down with lightning? Where did they get horses if they arrived on some small ships?\n\n9). Cirri did you really just put a fucking tiny bandage on a massive stab wound?\n\n10). The unicorn balls were pretty funny.",

        "body": " \n\nA thread on The Witcher book lore that is different from how the Netflix series presented things so far.\n\nFor those interested in knowing the canon lore of the Witcher books by Andrzej Sapkowski, but have not gotten around to reading them yet.\n\nSPOILERS, obviously:\n\n\\- Mousesack is not killed and replaced by a doppler. In fact, Mousesack survives through the entire book series.\n\n\\- Geralt is not surprised by Pavetta’s pregnancy after he already invokes the Law of Surprise. In fact, Geralt already knew Pavetta was pregnant and invoked the Law specifically to claim the unborn Ciri, although he doesn’t seem to know why he did it and later tries to backtrack. This is a key moment in which Fate basically makes Geralt do something that is necessary for the prophecy to be fulfilled\n\n\\- The incestuous relationship between King Foltest and his sister was not a secret, and was relatively commonly known. It is also widely accepted that their daughter was turned into a Striga by a curse prior to birth, although it is never known with certainty who spoke the curse\n\n\\- Yennefer hears Geralt’s exact words when he makes the Last Wish to the djinn. They even speak about it right afterwards. There is no plot point in which Yen finds out later and gets angry at Geralt for making the wish. \n\nThe Last Wish, incidentally, has nothing to do with falling in love. Geralt was already in love with Yen when he spoke the wish, and merely wished for them to always find a way to get back in each other’s presence. He made this wish as a way to ensure the djinn would not murder Yen, as this would mean he would die as well (and killing the wish maker goes against the principles of a djinn).\n\n\\- There is no baby born to Francesca Findabair and Filavandrel, nor is the birth of an elven child a very rare occurrence. The only thing the lore says is that elves generally have a shorter fertile window than humans and can only procreate early in their long lives. This means that the elven population grows much slower than the human one, but it’s not like there haven’t been elven births in years or something like that. Also the elves don’t get Cintra from Emhyr, they fight specifically for Dol Blathanna.\n\n\\- Yen never loses her magic powers. Also, fire magic is not forbidden magic, nor even particularly controversial. It’s just considered more dangerous and more difficult to control\n\n\\- Voleth Meir doesn’t exist and is never mentioned\n\n\\- Eskel doesn’t die at all\n\n\\- Kaer Morhen is never attacked at all\n\n\\- the entire plot point of giant obelisks doesn’t exist at all\n\n\\- Tissaia de Vries and Vilgefortz never have a relationship. If anything, Tissaia is somewhat of a mentor to Vilgefortz (who is much younger than her) and simply trusts him as an upcoming powerful mage.\n\n\\- Jaskier is not gay or bisexual. Also, Radovid is the baby son of king Vizimir, not his brother\n\n\\- Only Vizimir gets assassinated, and this happens during the events of the Thanedd Coup. The assassination seems to be done by Nilfgaard, but is later revealed to have been the work of Philippa Eilhart. Dijkstra doesn’t find out about this until much later. Queen Hedwig is never killed.\n\n\\- Cahir doesn’t suddenly repent and offer Ciri the chance to kill him. He only recants much later in the books and develops personal feelings for her.\n\n\\- Rience is not killed by Geralt. His death is way more brutal and satisfying, and takes place much later in the story. Basically, Ciri lures him into a trap on a thin pack of ice that he falls through, after which she ice skates over his fingers, making him lose his grip and drown in the icy water. It’s also not Rience himself who killed Codringher and Fenn\n\n\\- Yen never deliberately gives up her fertility, and sure doesn’t do it through some sort of surgical procedure. In fact, Yen’s backstory is never fully explained in the books but only alluded to.   \nThe only thing mentioned about sorceresses and fertility is that the majority of them become infertile as a natural consequence of learning to control Chaos. There are exceptions however, like Geralt’s own mother Visenna. These exceptions are why Yen is so keen on trying to get her fertility back, because she knows that in some cases it is possible. Just not in her case, as Nenneke points out to her in the book.\n\nI’m not sure if the series properly makes this clear by the way, but Witchers are always sterile as a consequence of their transformation during the Trial of the Grasses. There are no exceptions\n\n\\- Vesemir never tries to turn Ciri into a Witcher. For one this has never been done to a female subject, and secondly nobody knows what the “recipe” is for the Trial of the Grasses. All knowledge about making Witchers was lost back when Vesemir was much younger, during the Sack of Kaer Morhen. In the sack, all documents about the Trial were destroyed and all mages responsible for creati by Witchers were killed. So it’s impossible to make new Witchers on the first place.\n\n\\- Ciri is saved by a group of unicorns when she passes out in the desert after her “encounter” with Falka. The unicorns decide to save her life because of her earlier help to the unicorn she called Little Horse\n\nFeel free to add more things I may have overlooked!\n\n(This thread was a repost from a friend on a Witcher FB group.)",

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ef12oxn324ib1.jpg?width=360&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a57e20e32ce701e29c4552031bb34ad5a3ad52c2\n\nReview originally on [JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/the-wicked-and-the-willing-by-lianyu-tan)\n\n \n\n*The Wicked and The Willing* is an F/F Gothic Horror vampire novel, written by Lianyu Tan, which has won a Lambda and a Golden Crown. A story set in the 1920s in Singapore, touching themes such as colonialism and racism; but don't forget this is a horror novel, as we will see when the gothic elements appear, and at the same time, containing a romance plot, a love triangle between three characters whose origins and goals are really different. And before we dive into details, let me remember you to read the content warnings before going into this novel.\n\nGean Choo needs money; the debts she has inherited from her father are putting her in a dangerous situation, so when the mysterious Mrs. Edevane offers her a job, refusing it is not an option. But once in her service, Gean Choo starts discovering that there's more hidden than she expected; Verity Edevane is not a sick woman, but a vampire who needs blood to survive.  \nBut for Verity Edevane, getting any blood is not enough; she wants the sweet, salty blood that can be found in young woman's vein. And she's also looking for somebody to serve her with fealty and desire. Gean Choo is like a ring that perfectly fits her finger; showing her true nature to Gean Choo will mark the start of a steamy and obsessive relationship between them.  \nAs the third character, we have Po Lam, who is just seeking absolution after twenty years of serving faithfully Mrs Edevane. This life covering the consequences of Verity's acts has been too much; and seeing how Gean Choo falls for a love that will destroy her only reinforces her determination to save Gean Choo.\n\nWith this triangle established, we start delving into a slow burn romance story, a relationship that develops between Verity and Gean Choo; and while, at the first compasses, it is gently and even just lovely, soon it becomes an obsessive and a toxic one. Verity never considers Gean Choo as an equal, but more than a pet whose only purpose is to fulfill all her needs without questioning herself; not only because of the vampire-human difference but also due to their origins (Verity is from the metropolis and Gean Choo from the colony).   \nGean Choo falls under her spell and charm, even when Po Lam is trying to keep her safe; the perspective of financial security, the gifts from Verity and the comfort of living on the manor are enough to outweigh Po Lam's advertences.  \nBut as Verity's toxicity becomes more evident, the spell cracks and finally Gean Choo perceives the danger of staying with Mrs. Edevane. Not only that, but she's also able to grasp the contempt of Verity towards natives, realising she's not an equal but a pet to the colonizer.\n\nThe more we advance in the story, the more horror elements become prevalent. The oppressive atmosphere and the sensation of fear slowly oppresses us; we have spent a big time getting attached to the characters, and once the danger is obvious, it is omnipresent.\n\nLianyu Tan has exquisitely crafted the setting, a post WWI Singapore, a colony for Great Britain, full of tension and incidents related to the oppression from the invaders; the story starts with the Kreta Ayer Incident. Plenty of minor details are over the whole novel, reinforcing the historical sensation; and it captures marvelously the way colonizers behave as if they were superior to the Singaporean people.  \nIn this context, vampires are living in this world, some of them being part of the local politics, influencing it. But their society is extremely complex, based on a rigid hierarchy, and Verity has to plea to the desires of more powerful vampires. And in the same way British people see themselves over the native people, vampires consider themselves superior to humans, they are not much more than pets and blood bags.\n\nAnother peculiar aspect of this book is the possibility of being able to choose one of three endings (two in the book, one as a bonus for becoming a newsletter subscriber). I think it was neatly done (read the three, but finally I ended choosing what my heart felt), eliminating an aspect that tends to frustrate me on romance genre, as sometimes you want the main characters to end with other people, so this was a nice addition.\n\nIn general, all the praise I can give to *The Wicked and The Willing* won't probably be enough, because I seriously enjoyed much the experience this book it is. If you are looking for a steamy horror novel, with sapphic relationships, this is the perfect book for you. I'm really eager to read the next Lianyu Tan's books.",

Are they still technically on the same side?\n\n2) Also at some point geralt says to vilgefortz ‘emhyr is pulling your strings’. Does this mean its public knowledge that ciris dad is alive? And if he knows, why doesn’t ciri know? \n\n3) Also, why did cahir hand the sword to ciri and say he realised he was wrong for what he did to her kingdom and that she should kill him. He still works for nilfgaard, the same people who ordered him to sack cintra in the first place?",

It got me thinking, which characters in fantasy have the best titles/monikers? Specifically ones that evoke a certain image or idea, or for characters in which their reputation truly precede them.  \n\n\nSome of my favourites:\n\nSix of Crows: Kaz Brekker - Dirtyhands  \nMistborn: Kelsier - >!Survivor of Hathsin!<  \nWitcher Series: Geralt - The Butcher of Blaviken, The White Wolf  \nEmhyr Var Emreis - The White Flame that dances on the graves of his foes  \nASOIAF: Daenerys and all her monikers  \n\n\nWhat are yours?",

The acting is great, the underlying plot is there and keeps me engaged but something is amiss. \n\nI am not trying to be negative or disparage the show - it's still been a great journey. But I am asking a question - do you notice a change in writing between seasons 1/2 and season 3? Is that change due to something  specific or just following the books? \n\nJust as an example, I am on episode 6 and shortly after Yen split from Geralt/Ciri to go help Tissaia, Yen runs into the courtyard, gets \"saved\" by Stregobor to run away, and as she is running away she tells Triss to \"go find Geralt\". How does any of that make any sense? Another big gripe and inconsistency is seen earlier in the season where Yen literally abandons Ciri to go to Aretuza while she promised on her life to watch over Ciri. I get that they had a fight but one would thing a \"mother\" wouldn't jsut let her adopted mother run off into the wild while she goes politicking in Aretuza.\n\nI guess the reason for my post is just to see if people generally share the feeling and if there is an identifiable reason for this seemingly big difference in writing style between season 1/2 and 3?",

The tie-in to the main series with Jaskier in a battle of the Scoia'tael rescuing him as the Sandpiper got me thinking -- his role as Sandpiper is pretty much over by the end of Season 3, as the elves have mostly migrated and he is now busy finding Ciri with Geralt again. So I'm wondering, doesn't that mean he should have had his little experience with the ancient bard already, and shouldn't he have that knowledge about the monoliths (which seems like it would be helpful to present-day doings)? (Was this link present in the books? I think I read somewhere that Origin was totally new/not in the books.) I realize there are plot holes and if this is just another one, fine, but I wanted to know if I was thinking about this right.",

Did Dijkstra and Philippa bring in enough soldiers to stage a coup and just no one noticed?\n\nHow did the soldiers subdue all of the Continent’s most powerful mages? It looks like it was quick and easy. There look to be about ten soldiers (although I assume there are more). The mages seem weak and useless. How did the soldiers get them into those cuffs?\n\nAs Tissaia incants a spell to release the mages, the soldiers just stand there watching. There's a long pause where they could step in. Why don't they?\n\nAs the mages are released and attack his soldiers, Dijkstra takes the time to pat Geralt on the shoulder, before exiting the room through a door. He doesn’t run, he just walks. He does snap his fingers to indicate that his soldiers are to do something - presumably protect his retreat. To get past them, Geralt just has to punch one guard in the stomach. Then walk through the door. Outside the door, Dijkstra is still just walking, not running. He is then surprised that Geralt was also able to walk through the door and confront him. I am baffled by this. Is there a plausible explanation?\n\nThanks.",

        "body": "The Dark Tower remains one of my favorite series of all time, at least in part because of the way King blends fantasy, scifi and horror. I started my first read completely cold, so I got knocked off my feet >!when the story world started to bleed into the real world!<, and I'm always pleasantly surprised when I encounter similar themes in other texts.\n\nFor instance, when reading The Witcher, I loved all the chapters in which >!Ciri was bouncing between worlds and encountering tons of characters from other texts, postapocalyptic ruins!< and so-on. Recently, I finished The Shattered Seas by Joe Abercrombie, and I loved his creation of this convincing, albeit somewhat traditional, fantasy world >!inside the postapocalyptic future of our own. The moment the curtain came down to fully reveal the true nature of the \"elves\" and their \"magic\" was awesome!<.\n\nCan anyone recommend any other series that play with a similar theme? Bonus points if the reveal is handled subtly by breadcrumbing hints the reader can piece together before completely dropping the curtain. Thanks!",

        "body": "Between Geralt and Yennefer's timelines in 1x07 and Ciri's timeline in 1x01, it's quite hard to know how everything shakes out chronologically.\n\nFrom what I have so far:\n\n1. Geralt sees the Nilfgaard army near the Amell Pass and goes to Cintra, meets Mousesack in the tunnels and speaks with Calanthe in the streets with him where she \"Agrees\" to give Ciri up (1x07)\n\n2. Geralt's in the palace and meets Calanthe and the Ciri decoy but knows something is wrong, he sees the decoy say goodbye to the real Ciri from the archway as she plays with her friends in the street (1x07) - \\*Ciri plays with her friends in the streets and thinks she sees something in the archway before Sir Lazlo takes her away (1x01)\\* - Geralt then confronts Calanthe as Eist returns from Skellige, Geralt speaks with him outside and gets trapped between two metal gates afterwards (1x07)\n\n3. Ciri attends the knight swearing-in ceremony, still in the daytime (1x01)\n\n? Yenn and Istrid meet up again before Vilgefortz summons her back to Aretuza (1x07) still daylight but kind of iffy because in a different place in the continent\n\n? Ciri, Calanthe and Eist are feasting in the evening when they learn Nilfgaard is right on their doorstep (1x01)\n\n? Battle of Marnadal begins in its first scene where the Cintrans realise they're badly outnumbered, Ciri waits with Mousesack, second scene of battle where Cahir shoots Eist from across the battlefield. Calanthe returns to the palace wounded (1x01)\n\n? Mousesack holds the gate with his power from day until night but it doesn't last forever (1x01) then Calanthe, Ciri and Mousesack speak, including bits about Geralt - but it's like two fractured halves between 1x01 and 1x07 so it's not easy putting them together.  \n\n? The sorceror's convene at Aretuza and discuss the upcoming battle at Sodden but Fringilla's speech includes the siege at Cintra in progress (1x07) - \\*It's said on the Witcher wiki that \"A few days later\" Cintra is attacked by the Nilfgaardians following Geralt being trapped between the gates as he tries to leave\\*\n\n? Fighting in the Cintran streets breaks out and it goes between 1x01 and 1x07 with Ciri, Lazlo and Mousesack escaping before Cahir abducts her - and Geralt fighting to find information about Ciri. Plus Calanthe's death is seen in both episodes too\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I have everything there but I'm not sure. Is there anything I missed, or are things that are obviously in a certain order but I just can't see it?",

        "body": "I agree with most of the criticisms of this show. Season 2 was dreadful, most of season 3 was also quite bad. But I don’t regret watching this show because of one reason and one reason alone - MyAnna Buring as Tissaia de Vries.\n\nTissaia was already one of my favorite characters in the books. Despite her very limited time in the spotlight, she was beautifully developed, thematically important, and incredibly admirable while also being very realistically flawed. For a character with like 20 lines, she had a very coherent philosophy and worldview, which strongly shape both the readers’ view of events in the series, and other mages’. You could feel the effects of her presence and later her loss emanate throughout the entire series. She also had some of the most badass moments in the series (instantly breaking the barrier that took another mage a month to create, and my personal favorite, chewing out Philippa lol).\n\nNetflix Tissaia is definitely nowhere near as well written. Tissaia and Vilgefortz was just a terrible idea. I wish they kept Tissaia’s motivations more centered on responsibility towards the common people, and hope for Brotherhood cooperation, rather than her more personal-relationship driven motivations in the show. But, Tissaia was still Tissaia. Her power and poise were amazing. Her relationship with Yennefer was handled surprisingly well (IMO most believable relationship in the show outside of Geralt/Ciri). Her death was beautiful. And most importantly, MyAnna Buring gave it her all. Just an incredible performance by a very underrated actress. Tissaia single-handedly took the show from a 3/10 to a 5/10 for me.",

Also Geralt lost his memory and did he regain all of it at the end of 2 with Letho?

You have to learn how to swim real quick.\n\nYou’ll question if Muir, Cook, and Erikson have a friendship going because you have fucking no idea what’s going on in any of their books.\n\nBasically, this book is set in a futuristic society where manipulating the dead is our bread and gruel. There are 9 main Houses and each House has a necromancer and a cavalier (aka, swordsman/woman). You follow an MC cavalier and the adept (a fancy word for necromancer in this book) of the edge lord house, the 9th.\n\nThe goal: win immortality for a necromancer vs. seven other Houses. Oh, and my weird ass humor lives in this book too.\n\n2 brain cells live in our darling MC but that’s OK, you share that brain cell with her as you both have no fucking idea what’s going on. You forgot the other part where someone…? Uh, what is this?... Might... be in love with a dead girl in a coffi- For fuck’s sake, Gideon, get away from my script!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ö** ***Theme:*** Guiding Ahead Battle Theme - Arknights: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEuNaF3Dbeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEuNaF3Dbeo)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**Th**](https://www.amazon.com/Blacktongue-Thief-1/dp/125079997X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2VMDSCO5R2T6Y&keywords=the+blacktongue+thief&qid=1695987080&sprefix=the+blacktongue+thie%2Caps%2C203&sr=8-1)[**e Blacktongue Thie**](https://www.amazon.com/Blacktongue-Thief-1/dp/125079997X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2VMDSCO5R2T6Y&keywords=the+blacktongue+thief&qid=1695987080&sprefix=the+blacktongue+thie%2Caps%2C203&sr=8-1)[**f**](https://www.amazon.com/Blacktongue-Thief-1/dp/125079997X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2VMDSCO5R2T6Y&keywords=the+blacktongue+thief&qid=1695987080&sprefix=the+blacktongue+thie%2Caps%2C203&sr=8-1)  **by Christopher Buehlman**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Link to Review:** [**No Kyle, get \"Dune\" away from me**](https://cannedbreadblog.wordpress.com/2023/09/12/review-the-blacktongue-thief-by-christopher-buehlman-a-fox-god-at-court-5/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e3hzwdywerb1.jpg?width=493&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94318b567095efa82837485639c075814f2879e5\n\nRead if you appreciated “Between Two Fires” and/or you are one of the many believers that cats are your children. Because they fucking are, Kyle, I don’t care that your 2 kids are “what counts as real kids”. My cats are my children. Deal with it.\n\nSeriously, there’s a damn cat that plays a huge role in this book and accompanies the MC. That’s reason enough to throw money at Buehlman just so you can read about Bully Boy going “rao rao rao” and then hug your own cat that gives you the side eye like you committed treason.\n\nThe book follows a party that travels to a city for reasons not known to 2/3 of the party, including dry humor. The party has Patches from Dark Souls 1, Five Below ™ female Guts that has the giant crow from Dark Souls 1 as a summon, and a Mary Sue that has malware, occasionally snapping quips at people being annoying.\n\nEventually, there is a smut scene that makes you loop Moldova’s Eurovision entry over and over that it took 2 weeks to get out of your head, and now it’s back again. Thanks, Kyle.\n\n**Ö** ***Theme:*** Pasha Parfeni - Soarele şi Luna: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se9LDgFW6ak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se9LDgFW6ak)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**The Witcher Vol 6(?) “The Tower of Swallows”** ](https://www.amazon.com/The-Tower-of-Swallows-audiobook/dp/B01DDZ3HGC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KW4NC8WGHLHM&keywords=The+tower+of+swallows&qid=1695987912&sprefix=the+tower+of+swallow%2Caps%2C205&sr=8-1)**by Andrzej Sapkowski**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **No Review, Ongoing Series**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s1z25i90xerb1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c1c5ec420f1bf9af07803f5367dfdd9e04e03ca\n\nRead if you ever fantasized about ice skating pro, Yuzuru Hanyu, turning into a speed demon with a sword.\n\nThis volume is a bit more tragic in content as it deals with Ciri and what has been going on while Geralt is trekking with his Fellowship of Boomers™.\n\nWithout spoilers, it becomes an oddly enchanting tale of an old hermit and a young person talking to each other for about 70% of the book. Geralt and Yennefer take a back seat, sipping amaretto on the porch. For once, they are not heavy-lifting this book.\n\nLike every ending of Witcher volumes, the climaxes are always unexpected and the reveal hypes up the ante of the next book. You get a bit worried as this is the 2nd last book of the official series (not counting the prequel) though you’ll procrastinate as long as you can, like the ending of “Attack on Titan”...Yeah...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Ö*** ***Theme***: Yuzuru Hanyu PyeongChang 2018 : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EfsN7vEOA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EfsN7vEOA)\n\n**Runner-Up** **Clip**: Vincent Zhou's “Slow Dancing in the Dark” Routine: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vipIgnIGhLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vipIgnIGhLU)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years (Vol. 8)**](https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Slimes-Years-Maxed-Level-ebook/dp/B0894HSBRN/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1SYE5D60ZBC2A&keywords=i%27ve+been+killing+slimes+for+300+years+vol+8&qid=1695988853&sprefix=i%27ve+been+killing+slimes+for+300+years+vol+%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-2) **by Kisetsu Morita**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **No Review, Ongoing Series**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5q3wx52xerb1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0cf7b613d1e21e14443fd702f3665eb54ca68f8\n\nRead if you like chaotic problems...wait that’s every book in this series. But even more so that our intrepid MC meets god...or rather, more gods, discovers Twitch, and deals with teenage emotions.\n\nThe light novels trump the anime series by not wasting any time on descriptors and heading straight into dialogue and shenanigans. If you watched the anime series, it’s easy to graduate to the light novels by using the anime's visuals to be your guiding imagination, so don’t worry about the transition phase.\n\n*Do* worry about your wallet as none of these light novels are usually in libraries and you’ll find yourself spending more than you have on physical books in a year. *On one series.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ö** ***Theme***: Priorities in Yugioh: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh1nqnZAKxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh1nqnZAKxw)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**Th**](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rithmatist-audiobook/dp/B00BGSDWTG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PITJK079PKEC&keywords=rithmatist&qid=1695991113&sprefix=rithmatis%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1)[**e Rithm**](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rithmatist-audiobook/dp/B00BGSDWTG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PITJK079PKEC&keywords=rithmatist&qid=1695991113&sprefix=rithmatis%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1)[**atist**](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rithmatist-audiobook/dp/B00BGSDWTG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PITJK079PKEC&keywords=rithmatist&qid=1695991113&sprefix=rithmatis%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1)[ ](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rithmatist-audiobook/dp/B00BGSDWTG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PITJK079PKEC&keywords=rithmatist&qid=1695991113&sprefix=rithmatis%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1)**by Brandon Sanderson:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Link to Review:** [**It took me till now to realize**](https://cannedbreadblog.wordpress.com/2023/09/19/review-the-rithmatist-by-brandon-sanderson-soy-saucey-italian-food-sure-why-not/)[ **soy sauce in spaghetti if heated up by a wok, is just a noodle stir-fry**](https://cannedbreadblog.wordpress.com/2023/09/19/review-the-rithmatist-by-brandon-sanderson-soy-saucey-italian-food-sure-why-not/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2n7ikl3xerb1.jpg?width=489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=653c5fe10c92d8fc669d063271e3a3f952a2a57f\n\nRead if you ever wondered what Brandon Sanderson would do if he was in charge of “Harry Potter” in the 90s. You also want to read this if you were kept up at night wondering how Aons were taught at school after you finished reading “Elantris”. The answer is probably this book.\n\nYou are also a Koreaboo and wished Great Britain never ruled the world but wanted South Korea to do so….You question if this book saw the rise of K-pop...\n\nThis book is about 2 students trying to solve a missing person case using magic based on chalk drawings called rithmatics.\n\nOne kid is the Pokemon card game expert but he owns no cards and the other is a nepo baby but wishes she wasn’t.

This is what you imagined “The Long Dark” game in book format but with more BAMFs. You also would want to read this when “Prince of Thorns” is too long for your attention span and you realize this book is only 4 hours long. Suck it, Lawrence.\n\nYou’ll read about an MC being tasked with carrying wolf pelts to the next town over to sell for a profit. However, like all books, something goes wrong. Only...it gets worse by each step, in a gruesome way.\n\nYou also wanted to read about two weird medical practices done on others that may scar you for life. One would scar you for life when you’re terrified of needles. The other is asinine.\n\nOh, and your existent/non-existent balls are grabbed and referenced so hold on to those grapes for dear life.\n\nThere is a sense of dread as this is the prologue of Stang’s debut and the lead-up may well be hyped up. Does it pay off?

South Asian aka Brown like Jenoure 2. Literally as tall as an Emperor Penguin, give or take a few inches)!<\n\nCompared to Vol 1., Vol 2. goes into darker themes like parental abuse, gaslighting, prostitution, class divides, physical abuse, etc. There are not as many jovial cooking or eating-together events happening, but you can expect a chuckle or two here and there regardless.\n\nSince reading so many dark fantasies this year, you consider this “light-hearted” compared to shit happening in “Witcher” or “Black Company”.\n\nStill, this series does bring warmth to your stone-cold soul as it reminds you of your relationship with your partner (change hair and eye color, but personalities fit)\n\nAnd don’t forget Kraken doing his shenanigans that might *add* to that “warmth”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ö** ***Theme:*** *Farewell to the Summer Sun – Matt Berry:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TKm0uvwqNA*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TKm0uvwqNA)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**A Game of Thrones**](https://www.amazon.com/A-Game-of-Thrones-audiobook/dp/B0001DBI1Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NM5CYH537U86&keywords=game+of+thrones+book&qid=1696004438&sprefix=game+of+thrones+boo%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-1) **by GRRM:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Link to Review: TBA**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kniioyoaxerb1.jpg?width=459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cd5310c5a8429284abe2f75a7de4c89f8776ff9\n\nRead when the emotion of “happiness” is as foreign as the love Catelyn Stark has for Jon Snow.\n\nYou don’t want to feel any good emotions but submerge yourself in ***suffering***. Kyle, this is definitely what you read after fawning over “Nevernight”.\n\nIn short, the story is a second-in-command is needed in King’s Landing and the king of Lannister has chosen tired as fuck Boomer, Ned Stark of the House of Winterfell.\n\nThe House of Winterfell has the following characters: **Ned** the tired as fuck dad, **Sansa** the unlikable bitch, **Arya** the tomcat, **Bran** the innocent, **Catelyn** the mom bitch, **Jon** the luckless, **Robb** the “too young for this shit”, and **Rickon** the \"reason why I'm never having human children\".\n\nLannister has **Ceresei** the Queen Bitch, **Jamie** the twin brother to the Queen aka Asshat, and **Tyrion** the disinherited brother that gets flack for being a little person (*Not* dwarf), but probably the best personality in this entire book, sharing that throne with Arya.\n\nThere are too many characters that appear in this story so it is perfectly fine not to remember everyone. Ignore the side characters and focus on remembering the names of the MCs of each House.\n\nThere’s also a side story of the Targaryens, the House that was booted off of King’s Landing by the Lannisters, alongside this mess of the Winterfell House. You just need to remember 3 characters there: **Viserys** the screaming man-child, **Daenerys** the ticking time bomb, and **Drogo** the guy who “bought” Daenerys.\n\nAlso read if you’re the type of person who *loves* to be on Twitter because there’s always someone to be mad at, pity over, argue with, back-stab you, mesmerized by art >!(I loved reading about the ice Wall)!< and you’re always rooting for at least *one person* to not die. And there’s plenty of doggos….That may or may not die (Look up trigger warnings for this if you haven’t read the book...there’s a lot.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ö** ***Theme:*** *Forever and a Day  – Freddie Gibbs:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmF-46tgP6c*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmF-46tgP6c)\n\n>!(Weirdly fitting of this whole book)!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Conclusion**: @\n\nI’m still sick AF when writing this and probably after I finish this entire blog post I’m gonna lie down forever.\n\nReviews for “The House Witch” and “AGoT” will happen sometime in October.

Because they fucking are, Kyle, I don’t care that your 2 kids are “what counts as real kids”. My cats are my children. Deal with it.\n\nSeriously, there’s a damn cat that plays a huge role in this book and accompanies the MC. That’s reason enough to throw money at Buehlman just so you can read about Bully Boy going “rao rao rao” and then hug your own cat that gives you the side eye like you committed treason.\n\nThe book follows a party that travels to a city for reasons not known to 2/3 of the party, including dry humor. The party has Patches from Dark Souls 1, Five Below ™ female Guts that has the giant crow from Dark Souls 1 as a summon, and a Mary Sue that has malware, occasionally snapping quips at people being annoying.\n\nEventually, there is a smut scene that makes you loop Moldova’s Eurovision entry over and over that it took 2 weeks to get out of your head, and now it’s back again. Thanks, Kyle.\n\n**Ö** ***Theme:*** Pasha Parfeni - Soarele şi Luna: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se9LDgFW6ak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se9LDgFW6ak)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**The Witcher Vol 6(?) “The Tower of Swallows”** ](https://www.amazon.com/The-Tower-of-Swallows-audiobook/dp/B01DDZ3HGC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KW4NC8WGHLHM&keywords=The+tower+of+swallows&qid=1695987912&sprefix=the+tower+of+swallow%2Caps%2C205&sr=8-1)**by Andrzej Sapkowski**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **No Review, Ongoing Series**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s1z25i90xerb1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c1c5ec420f1bf9af07803f5367dfdd9e04e03ca\n\nRead if you ever fantasized about ice skating pro, Yuzuru Hanyu, turning into a speed demon with a sword.\n\nThis volume is a bit more tragic in content as it deals with Ciri and what has been going on while Geralt is trekking with his Fellowship of Boomers™.\n\nWithout spoilers, it becomes an oddly enchanting tale of an old hermit and a young person talking to each other for about 70% of the book. Geralt and Yennefer take a back seat, sipping amaretto on the porch. For once, they are not heavy-lifting this book.\n\nLike every ending of Witcher volumes, the climaxes are always unexpected and the reveal hypes up the ante of the next book. You get a bit worried as this is the 2nd last book of the official series (not counting the prequel) though you’ll procrastinate as long as you can, like the ending of “Attack on Titan”...Yeah...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Ö*** ***Theme***: Yuzuru Hanyu PyeongChang 2018 : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EfsN7vEOA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23EfsN7vEOA)\n\n**Runner-Up** **Clip**: Vincent Zhou's “Slow Dancing in the Dark” Routine: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vipIgnIGhLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vipIgnIGhLU)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years (Vol. 8)**](https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Slimes-Years-Maxed-Level-ebook/dp/B0894HSBRN/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1SYE5D60ZBC2A&keywords=i%27ve+been+killing+slimes+for+300+years+vol+8&qid=1695988853&sprefix=i%27ve+been+killing+slimes+for+300+years+vol+%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-2) **by Kisetsu Morita**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **No Review, Ongoing Series**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5q3wx52xerb1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0cf7b613d1e21e14443fd702f3665eb54ca68f8\n\nRead if you like chaotic problems...wait that’s every book in this series. But even more so that our intrepid MC meets god...or rather, more gods, discovers Twitch, and deals with teenage emotions.\n\nThe light novels trump the anime series by not wasting any time on descriptors and heading straight into dialogue and shenanigans. If you watched the anime series, it’s easy to graduate to the light novels by using the anime's visuals to be your guiding imagination, so don’t worry about the transition phase.\n\n*Do* worry about your wallet as none of these light novels are usually in libraries and you’ll find yourself spending more than you have on physical books in a year. *On one series.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ö** ***Theme***: Priorities in Yugioh: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh1nqnZAKxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh1nqnZAKxw)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**Th**](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rithmatist-audiobook/dp/B00BGSDWTG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PITJK079PKEC&keywords=rithmatist&qid=1695991113&sprefix=rithmatis%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1)[**e Rithm**](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rithmatist-audiobook/dp/B00BGSDWTG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PITJK079PKEC&keywords=rithmatist&qid=1695991113&sprefix=rithmatis%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1)[**atist**](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rithmatist-audiobook/dp/B00BGSDWTG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PITJK079PKEC&keywords=rithmatist&qid=1695991113&sprefix=rithmatis%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1)[ ](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rithmatist-audiobook/dp/B00BGSDWTG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PITJK079PKEC&keywords=rithmatist&qid=1695991113&sprefix=rithmatis%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1)**by Brandon Sanderson:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Link to Review:** [**It took me till now to realize**](https://cannedbreadblog.wordpress.com/2023/09/19/review-the-rithmatist-by-brandon-sanderson-soy-saucey-italian-food-sure-why-not/)[ **soy sauce in spaghetti if heated up by a wok, is just a noodle stir-fry**](https://cannedbreadblog.wordpress.com/2023/09/19/review-the-rithmatist-by-brandon-sanderson-soy-saucey-italian-food-sure-why-not/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2n7ikl3xerb1.jpg?width=489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=653c5fe10c92d8fc669d063271e3a3f952a2a57f\n\nRead if you ever wondered what Brandon Sanderson would do if he was in charge of “Harry Potter” in the 90s. You also want to read this if you were kept up at night wondering how Aons were taught at school after you finished reading “Elantris”. The answer is probably this book.\n\nYou are also a Koreaboo and wished Great Britain never ruled the world but wanted South Korea to do so….You question if this book saw the rise of K-pop...\n\nThis book is about 2 students trying to solve a missing person case using magic based on chalk drawings called rithmatics.\n\nOne kid is the Pokemon card game expert but he owns no cards and the other is a nepo baby but wishes she wasn’t. Just imagine how many books you could buy if you were a nepo baby...\n\nDaydreaming aside, the MC always points to the Sanderson version of “HP Book 1 Snape” but everyone’s just like, “Right Joel, whatever you say, Zoomer.

This is what you imagined “The Long Dark” game in book format but with more BAMFs. You also would want to read this when “Prince of Thorns” is too long for your attention span and you realize this book is only 4 hours long. Suck it, Lawrence.\n\nYou’ll read about an MC being tasked with carrying wolf pelts to the next town over to sell for a profit. However, like all books, something goes wrong. Only...it gets worse by each step, in a gruesome way.\n\nYou also wanted to read about two weird medical practices done on others that may scar you for life. One would scar you for life when you’re terrified of needles. The other is asinine.\n\nOh, and your existent/non-existent balls are grabbed and referenced so hold on to those grapes for dear life.\n\nThere is a sense of dread as this is the prologue of Stang’s debut and the lead-up may well be hyped up. Does it pay off?

South Asian aka Brown like Jenoure 2. Literally as tall as an Emperor Penguin, give or take a few inches)!<\n\nCompared to Vol 1., Vol 2. goes into darker themes like parental abuse, gaslighting, prostitution, class divides, physical abuse, etc. There are not as many jovial cooking or eating-together events happening, but you can expect a chuckle or two here and there regardless.\n\nSince reading so many dark fantasies this year, you consider this “light-hearted” compared to shit happening in “Witcher” or “Black Company”.\n\nStill, this series does bring warmth to your stone-cold soul as it reminds you of your relationship with your partner (change hair and eye color, but personalities fit)\n\nAnd don’t forget Kraken doing his shenanigans that might *add* to that “warmth”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ö** ***Theme:*** *Farewell to the Summer Sun – Matt Berry:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TKm0uvwqNA*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TKm0uvwqNA)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**A Game of Thrones**](https://www.amazon.com/A-Game-of-Thrones-audiobook/dp/B0001DBI1Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NM5CYH537U86&keywords=game+of+thrones+book&qid=1696004438&sprefix=game+of+thrones+boo%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-1) **by GRRM:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Link to Review: TBA**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kniioyoaxerb1.jpg?width=459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cd5310c5a8429284abe2f75a7de4c89f8776ff9\n\nRead when the emotion of “happiness” is as foreign as the love Catelyn Stark has for Jon Snow.\n\nYou don’t want to feel any good emotions but submerge yourself in ***suffering***. Kyle, this is definitely what you read after fawning over “Nevernight”.\n\nIn short, the story is a second-in-command is needed in King’s Landing and the king of Lannister has chosen tired as fuck Boomer, Ned Stark of the House of Winterfell.\n\nThe House of Winterfell has the following characters: **Ned** the tired as fuck dad, **Sansa** the unlikable bitch, **Arya** the tomcat, **Bran** the innocent, **Catelyn** the mom bitch, **Jon** the luckless, **Robb** the “too young for this shit”, and **Rickon** the \"reason why I'm never having human children\".\n\nLannister has **Ceresei** the Queen Bitch, **Jamie** the twin brother to the Queen aka Asshat, and **Tyrion** the disinherited brother that gets flack for being a little person (*Not* dwarf), but probably the best personality in this entire book, sharing that throne with Arya.\n\nThere are too many characters that appear in this story so it is perfectly fine not to remember everyone. Ignore the side characters and focus on remembering the names of the MCs of each House.\n\nThere’s also a side story of the Targaryens, the House that was booted off of King’s Landing by the Lannisters, alongside this mess of the Winterfell House. You just need to remember 3 characters there: **Viserys** the screaming man-child, **Daenerys** the ticking time bomb, and **Drogo** the guy who “bought” Daenerys.\n\nAlso read if you’re the type of person who *loves* to be on Twitter because there’s always someone to be mad at, pity over, argue with, back-stab you, mesmerized by art >!(I loved reading about the ice Wall)!< and you’re always rooting for at least *one person* to not die. And there’s plenty of doggos….That may or may not die (Look up trigger warnings for this if you haven’t read the book...there’s a lot.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ö** ***Theme:*** *Forever and a Day  – Freddie Gibbs:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmF-46tgP6c*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmF-46tgP6c)\n\n>!(Weirdly fitting of this whole book)!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Conclusion**: @\n\nI’m still sick AF when writing this and probably after I finish this entire blog post I’m gonna lie down forever.\n\nReviews for “The House Witch” and “AGoT” will happen sometime in October.

(Facebook and Twitter don’t exist)\n\nYou mindlessly scroll through your feed.\n\nAh, someone’s pregnant? Cool.\n\nA lucrative job offer is up for grabs? Awesome.\n\nYour friend found wolves in the back of their woods and now they’ve adopted them as the sole protectors of their children because who needs parents? Huh?\n\nSomewhere during this scrolling, you stop and sip your drink. You have a momentary post-social media clarity that everything….everything in social media is made for you to react strongly.\n\nThat shitty guy killed your best friend? You want to get mad and tell him he’s a piece of shit.\n\nWill he change? Probably not.\n\nReport him to the police? Won’t do shit, he’s still assaulting people left and right like a temper tantrum because he’s rich and famous.\n\nIs your other friend being abusive to her stepson? No amount of mansplaining will save that child unless he or you contact the authorities.\n\nYour childhood crush gets shipped to exile but he’s still posting hot selfies? Nice.\n\nAnd then it encourages you to keep scrolling to find more injustices (or hot selfies of your exiled crush) in society that you start drowning from all the evil (or OnlyFans) there is in this world and you find yourself imagining you’re part of Anonymous to fix the world. (Or a Suga parent)\n\nBut then…two people you follow are like your guiding light. They tell their followers they’re moving from these social media platforms to focus on their blogs and you sigh in relief.\n\nYou finally have a reason to escape the shittiness of social media. (…but still want to see that OF). At the end of the day, someone else will get mad for you, report that asshole being a dick to wolves, or the dipshit who’s murdered your friend’s husband, because let’s face it\n\nMost people want to be a queen or king of social clout. Even for a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Real Thoughts:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!I read this book to catch up from a decade-plus of not reading anything. In the 10s, it was THE fire thing to talk about, hell, even my partner’s mom knew of GoT. Before I even read this book, I paused and thought, “OK, this show/book has some of the most toxic characters and plot I have ever seen….it’s nothing but pain, why do people like this?”!<\n\n>!There’s 100% a study on why people like GoT even though the world and characters are so depressingly “realistic” or toxic, however, I’m going to theorize myself without research.!<\n\n>!My conclusion is: that people usually love to hate on something or remember people they hate, far more than the people they love.!<\n\n>!Why?!<\n\n>!Early survival instincts taught us to remember a bad thing because it meant we lived to another day. For example, if your best friend got eaten by a lion yesterday in a savanna that had a lake, you are more likely to remember that savanna for days to come, rather than the time your mom gave you a banana.!<\n\n>!And Larry here only remembers about the banana and not the savanna and goes waltzing to his funeral. Survival of the fittest, err, smartest.!<\n\n>!Now for GoT, remembering this logic, you remember Cersei and Joffrey plenty, and when you talk to them with your friends or colleagues and y’all are like, “Man, they’re such assholes, right?!”!<\n\n>!So you rag on them more to your friends, then your other friends are like, “Wtf is GoT?” “Why should I read it?” “CAUSE JON SNOW IS SO HOT” “…” “What?”!<\n\n>!The amount of unlikable to likable characters is favored more over to unlikable and I feel the only likable ones that aren’t deranged are Arya, Jon, Bran, and to a lesser extent Tyrion.!<\n\n>!Eddard/Ned I feel like is the tired mid-life crisis dad, tired of everyone trying to be a badass or evil, and is seemingly the only sane person in King’s Landing before he’s executed. But he’s also a hypocrite for fucking up a lot in his life, how he handled the situation with Jon and Catelyn, and the fact he brought his daughters to Land’s End where there was a strong possibility they could have been held for ransom when he knew how batshit the Lannisters are….And it happened anyway.!<\n\n>!Daenerys is pitiable for her situation and straight up raped after their wedding night to an older guy the following weeks, but her viewpoints I unfortunately got spoiled by how she turns out at the “end” of the series.!<\n\n>!Robert is morally gray but he’s still a touch mad cause of the Lannisters.!<\n\n>!There is so much evil and it was trying to portray a “realistic” fantasy society but… I doubt half of the population is so unlikable and evil 24/7. I guess that’s why GRRM focused on House Stark since most of them are morally gray.!<\n\n>!But there was so much shit going on without any dopamine hit, that I rather read “Harrow” than GoT (I’m reading “Harrow” as my distraction reading, that’s how much it felt like my rescue inhaler compared to GoT.)!<\n\n>!I doubt I’m going to read any more of ASOIAF but if I do, it’ll mostly be Wiki articles to read characters and lore. GoT has good worldbuilding and prose though. It flows like silk. However, characters like side characters are thrown in so much that the reader can’t remember any of them. The plot was a character and political drama. When it was around characters I cared for (Sansa can suck Joffrey’s dick) I was focused a lot on the story. When it came to Sansa or Catelyn, my eyes rolled to the back of my brain. It’s like reading your high school bully’s diary. Realistically, how much would you want to read a diary that says they want to kill their sister or kill their son, by heavens, why would I want to read that?!<\n\n>!A defense could be that there will be justice eventually. Right? Or do you want to see how it would end? But like hun…I got boundaries. I ain’t got time for this angst fic.!<\n\n>!Vampa is waiting for me to read her next tetralogy book, there could be better Soulsbourne books waiting for me at my door, and Delemhach is dangling the last book of “The House Witch” at me. And I rather read “Harrow” and “Raven Tower” than any of this. (In “Raven Tower”’s defense, I haven’t read enough of it to determine if I don’t like it, my point is, I’m enjoying it more than “GoT”)!<\n\n>!Some mind dumping: I think the reason why I like “Soulsbourne” so much even though it’s about as grimdark as well, is that at least I can have some hit of dopamine when I beat a boss. What dopamine do I get when I get to a Catelyn chapter? That she dunks more on Jon and hates a random bastard girl who did nothing wrong to Catelyn? Sure, Arya, Jon, Bran, and Tyrion chapters can be counted as dopamine, but that’s no guarantee anything good will happen to them. They’re the ones that suffer the most in my opinion.!<\n\n>!You can argue that all of these are human and it’s a breath of fresh air but at some point…that fresh air is gonna become toxic with the amount of CO2 you’re pumpin’.!<\n\n>!Only Tyrion, Arya, Bran, and Jon are gonna be of any decent(ish) human enough to take refuge in so huff that COPIUM that all 4 of these characters get a happy end (which they probably won’t)!<\n\n>!Random thought: Do people just skip the chapters of the characters they don’t like? Is that normal?!<\n\n**Cover Art:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibeyo6c1getb1.jpg?width=459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02dfb189673d72b8b2d322c433e096d7d7ccdca7\n\nLike Sanderson’s books, there are so many editions and cover artists that it’s impossible to recognize all of them.\n\nThe artist who did the cover for the book I read I sadly was not able to track down, however, if you know who created it, please comment below!\n\nIt has a visually appealing cover.\n\nThe dragon eyes seemed like a bit of a weird addition at first as a way to insert dragons into everything until I thought about it. >!True, dragons aren’t exactly seen until the last page, but the hints and the meaning behind the dragons embedded into the Iron Throne itself are seen throughout its history and were a nod to it.!<\n\nNot the best cover, but not bad either. It does the job of selling you a book, nothing more, nothing less.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tags**:\n\n**High Fantasy**, **Dark**, **Character Drama**, **Fantasy Politics**, **Court Intrigue**, **Rape**, **Sexual Assault**, **Step-Parental Abuse**, **Animal Abuse**, **Multiple POVs**, **Blood, Gore**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Plot**:\n\nThe plot revolves around King Robert who married into House Lannister and needs a new second-in-command at King’s Landing. He travels to Winterfell to appeal to Lord Eddard Stark to accept the position. Seemingly having no choice but to accept, Stark travels with his two daughters, Arya and Sansa, to King’s Landing to serve his new job.\n\nAt this point, House Stark is separated and various events happen that mainly divide the house into 3 branches: one at King’s Landing, one still at Winterfell, and the last is exiled to defend the Wall, a place where only low members of society are taken to serve for the rest of their life.\n\nThere is also a side story plot alongside these POVs of House Targaryen, the exiled House thanks to the Lannisters.\n\nIt’s a solid plot, I give points where it’s due. If you want something engrossing, this book might just be for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Characters**:\n\nCharacters, huh?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Publisher:* How many characters do you want in your story?\n\n*GRRM:* Yes.\n\nI swear, more side characters in this story randomly get named for doing nothing but moving a horse to the left side of the barn but I’m still supposed to remember him because of reasons. GRRM forgot he was not on the writing staff of Pokemon.\n\nStill, he does give all the main characters depth that they truly are living and breathing people.\n\nThe question of whether you would like them is another story altogether.\n\nEach POV will give you a good grasp of what they are like, down to their flaws and good traits and you swear you’re reading a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pacing**:\n\nHere is where I deduct 2 points from the whole book. It’s not just about the pacing but how GRRM designed his whole novel. It’s the structure itself. I mentioned it in “Characters” but he introduces so many side characters that I start to not understand what the point the book was trying to make to begin with. It throws the structure off because we’re exploring this side character that maybe gets mentioned 3 times in a book only to be killed off.\n\nAnd he throws a big revelation in certain POVs only to slow it down by not going into it until like 5 POVs later.\n\nIt’s not the pacing, but more of how he structured the book. But the pacing suffers as a result of the structure if that makes sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prose**:\n\nGRRM is a strong-ass writer. You can *really* tell in his work that he knows how to write a novel. If he wrote a novel about frogs, it’ll probably be a bestseller. [Because…what are frogs?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJRKedSUHg4)\n\nI want to say that his prose style is not similar to Sanderson at all but also not similar to Tolkien, but neither similar to Lawrence either.\n\nGRRM is like his own style combining these guys’ works to just have his own. This is incredible given Sanderson and Lawrence didn’t even start publishing until way later.\n\nHe knows when to be flowery with his prose, historical in exposition, and natural in dialogue. He has a good balance of it all that when he drones on about the world, it’s engaging and mysterious. Props to GRRM for knowing how to write his prose cause that’s something every writer needs to master.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vibe**:\n\nThe vibe is hard to pinpoint since we juggle so many POVs that the only vibe is ***suffering*** as barely anyone gets a satisfactory conclusion by the end of this book. In fairness, it is a series so no one gets an ending per se.\n\nImagine reading every character’s diary of their thoughts and feelings in a typical fantasy setting. Castles, dragon heritage, court drama, except insert direwolves in the mix. Just make sure to put a healthy dollop of ***depression*** to top it off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Worldbuilding**:\n\nHere is where I wish GRRM focused his work more on. When he does talk about worldbuilding it makes the whole book shine. However it took the backseat and instead, he made this book a character and political drama. I wasn’t a fan of it, though that’s just my opinion. (Now deep breaths, and say after me, “Everyone has an opinion. It’s ok that I don’t agree with every random person online. And- No…don’t break that keyboard, I just got that…)\n\nGRRM’s worldbuiliding includes the history of the world and how the territories came to be. Occasionally there is a backstory on different Houses like Stark and Targaryen.\n\nIt is in the Orderly Method: information is presented in usually uniform pieces and can be seen as its own separate text if placed back to back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fix It AU:**\n\nIf I were personally in charge of fixing GoT:\n\nI would switch up which characters get POVs, less rape, eliminate the number of side characters by half, focus more on Worldbuilding, fix the pacing to take advantage of hyped-up revelations and mellow it out when it needs to just have Ned walking a hallway in one sentence, not 5 paragraphs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Warning:**\n\nIf you’re new to “Game of Thrones” like I was, I highly recommend looking up trigger warning sites as there is a lot of shit happening. Doesthedogdie.com is pretty good at listing a ton of media triggers but it might be helpful to look at multiple sources to be safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, Who Should Read This?**\n\nRead if you had a shitty breakup and need to be depressed and engrossed in a book that could rival how shitty your life is at present.\n\nYou also like reading unlikable characters that remind you of your ex and don’t want to stray too far from fantasy elements. You want **DEATH, BLOOD, AND KNIVES-** wait wrong- no it’s the right book, Kyle.\n\nDon’t fret too much about it being depressing, because life is infinitely way better than anything happening in GoT. Just look at Jon Snow’s OF and you’ll be fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.5/5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(It was originally a 3 in last month’s RRR, but after further brewing of this book, I didn’t like it. It has a very strong skeleton that I can’t ignore and will study it at my own pace, but ultimately, I didn’t enjoy the meat of it.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevious Review: [The Wolf and the She-Bear by Morgan Stang](https://cannedbreadblog.wordpress.com/2023/09/26/review-the-wolf-and-the-she-bear-by-morgan-stang-med-school-never-signed-anyone-up-for-that/)\n\nUpdate: “Half a King” review will be up Friday 12 PM CT, stay tuned!",

The Netflix tv show, while being a mostly horrendous mess didn't dissuade me. After all, we all know books are better than their adaptions. So I dove in. Now I've read them all. Both short story collections, the five main novels, and the standalone Season of Storms, which I finished this morning.\n\nThe short stories are the reason I completed the series.

They provided the momentum for me to dive into the first of the 5 mainline novels.\n\nFrom there, things really quickly go off the rails. I can best describe the series as overly sprawling and meandering. Viewpoints are more numerous than rats in the cellar. We spend undue amounts of time in the company of individuals debating at length on the complicated politics that at best tangentially relate to our heroes' journeys. One might argue this can be a strong point of the series. A pivotal battle scene takes place with none of our protagonists present. It's riveting, and monumentally significant in the political landscape. I enjoyed reading it. But it's also unnecessary, and saps the momentum from our heroes' adventures.\n\nThough I use the term \"adventure\" loosely. Really it's more like a rollercoaster ride of brutality and suffering on which our protagonists are merely along for the ride. There is something to be said for the tone setting of a story in which the main characters have little control over the events happening to them, but I found it tiringly so here. Five books is a long time to spend with characters unable to make proactive progress to their goals.\n\nNot to mention proactive character growth. I lost count of the number of times Geralt would struggle with accepting the help of his friends. An inner conflict can only be re-hashed so often before it becomes tiresome. Perhaps it was because of the eternally rotating cast of companions. I like good side characters as much as the next reader, but there comes a certain point where I'm just not going to care about this new young woman. I don't care about her backstory. I don't care about her hopes and dreams. I've grown attached to the barber surgeon from book 3 and my capacity has reached its limit.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't some terrific scenes. Suffice to say I won't ever think about skating on a frozen lake the same after a particularly fantastic (and hella bloody) section. But at the same time, the books have an irritating knack of setting up interesting action, then skipping it over and recapping it in dialog afterwards. I wanted to see the mages battling on the boat in the midst of a whirlpool. Not hear the winner gloating about it down the line.\n\nOddly enough (or perhaps not oddly at all) the world that first drew me in does stay strong throughout. In fact, over the course of the full series the infusion of classic Arthurian legends makes it even better. It's a grim world though, sometimes to a fault. When it becomes predictable that any place of respite will soon be stripped away you begin to stray close to almost a parody. Humorous in its effort to immerse itself in tragedy. A good time for a note on content: I don't think I was completely ready for what the grimdark genre entails. There were one or two points where I seriously considered abandoning the series because I was starting to feel a bit sick to my stomach.\n\nOnce finished with the series I gained sympathy for the Netflix show writers.

I'm familiar with the games and some information from the books, but not very much. \n\nI'm still confused as to why tissaia told yennefer to wait for the knocks unless she *wanted* yennefer to see her turn the other girls into eels. OR if she was still debating whether or not she was going to let yennefer ascend. \n\nDoes anyone else have anymore insight on this that I may not have? I'm open to any interpretations obviously. \n\nI personally think Tissaia may have wanted Yennefer to see what could have happened to her, had she not gotten the flower (the name eludes me right now) from istred.",

        "body": "To start, The Witcher 3 is my first Witcher game and experience with The Witcher overall, I've yet to watch the show or read any of the books. I first started my journey with this game back in 2018 and made it to Skellige, I remember the quest I left on as well, I was to meet up with Yen after getting dressed for \"The King is Dead\" quest. Unfortunately leading up to that point I had burned myself out on doing all the side content in White Orchard, Velen and Novigrad. Before I dropped the game though I remember working on Triss' side quest and managed to kiss her at the party and knew I wanted to romance her since a friend who finished the game told me about the two romance options and suggested I go with Yen. I'm a sucker for red heads and I liked how sweet Triss was so she was the obvious choice for me.\n\nFast forward to 2023 and I'm finally returning to The Witcher 3 in hopes to finish it this time and I'm romancing Triss again but now that I'm close to finishing Act 1 I can see why so many go with Yen instead. She appears a bit much for Geralt to handle at times but my god they're perfect for each other. I've already gone and done Triss' side quest and told her I loved her, I do have a backup save but it's way too far back for my liking and realistically I should have made a save before I finished Triss' quest. This post probably seems pointless since I'm sure I'm not the first nor will I be the last to be this conflicted over these two but dammit, right when I was thinking \"Nah Yen has nothing on Triss\" she slowly starts to grow on me. Now I'm afraid to do her side quest, I don't want to reject her but I have to.",

He’s someone who despite standing amongst strong individuals shine son his own. I want a performer not a fighter like Jaskier. Someone who people might misinterpret like Geralt and Yenneffer did with Jaskier when calling him shallow. A character who isn’t emotionally unavailable but shows it with no regards. A character who sticks to others like glue once he likes them well enough. I’m not really good at descriptions but I hope this helps. If he’s funny it’s also a bonus.",

I love the funny scene where some Sorceresses gossip about him in front of him in Elder Speech, and he pretends to not understand, and they pretend not to realize. Later they call him on it.\n\nI also feel like he'd have held his own in conversations with Dijsktra and Radovid better. Things like: \"What do you think made Redania strong?\" \"I’ll wager her armies\". Pah. A simpleton's answer that's only there to give Dijkstra an opening to display his statesmanship.

For some reason they have yennifer be mad at geralt even though she should be furious at Triss for taking advantage of her soulmate knowing full well he was in a vulnerable situation.\n\n\n\nIt's the reason why they had to sacrifice Yennifer and Ciri's mother/daughter relationship in this game. CD projects obsession with this character is the reason why Ciri couldn't call Yennifer mother and why Yennifer never refers to Ciri as her daughter( she only ever calls her by name). When they reunite they act like a couple of best friends that haven't seen each other in 2 years instead of a parent and child that have been separated for far too long. They always drive home to point that Gerald and Siri are father and daughter, but for some reason(triss) they leave Yennifer out of the whole parent child dynamic. I wish there was a scene where you could see Jennifer comforting and hugging Ciri after all of the traumatizing shit she went through or during(or after) visimers funeral you can see Yennifer hugging a crying Ciri.\n\nThey knew if those two had that kind of connection shown it would make people not want to reject Yennifer in the lore breaking quest The Last Wish( don't even get me started on how that Quest doesn't make an once of and how it completely reverses already established character development).",

        "title": "In defense of Triss Merigold",
        "body": "So it seems there's a running notion in the Witcher fanbase that Triss Merigold is a completely awful character with few redeeming qualities, and that her relationship with Geralt in the games is completely ridiculous (as justified by certain excerpts from the books). Well I've just finished reading the books, and would like to offer a counterargument for each of the accusations levied against the character.\n\n1. \"Triss used magic to take advantage of Geralt in the books.\"\n\nIn Blood of Elves, Triss describes her first romantic encounter with Geralt:\n\n\"...she had seduced the witcher - with the help of a little magic\". \n\nThe assumption that Triss used any mind-altering spells on Geralt is the most dramatic possible interpretation of that statement. It's important to remember that seduction is a vital part of being a sorcerer/ess in the Witcher universe. They all use this constantly through magically augmenting their appearance with a magical makeup called Glamarye. She \"seduced the witcher\", she didn't \"coerce the witcher\". It is far more likely that she magically augmented her appearance than manipulated Geralt. However, even assuming Triss did coerce Geralt, she would be no worse than Geralt's other lovers who manipulated/controlled him with or without magic (Yennefer, Fringilla, etc.).\n\n\n2. \"Triss is a bad person and surrogate sister to Ciri, who she plans to give to the lodge. She also betrays Geralt multiple times.\"\n\nThis one makes some sense. Triss refuses to help Yen find Ciri and instead assists the Lodge, who plan to use Ciri against Nilfgaard. This illustrates Triss' glaring character flaw in the books: she is a coward.\nMultiple times Triss tries to disobey the Lodge and help Yen, only to immediately back down when confronted by Phillippa Eilhart. Triss is destined to die after surviving the battle of Sodden Hill, and is in a state where she will do anything to keep herself alive. Phillippa knows this. The end of her character arc in the books is facing her fears and \"finding a hill to die on\", willingly disobeying the Lodge and Phillippa by protecting Yen, Geralt and Ciri. At the end of the books, she has overcome her flaws and is someone who is brave and selfless. This is contradicted in the Witcher 1 and 2, where she immediately bows down to Phillippa and the Lodge again. That's not the character still being awful, that's those games being poorly written.\n\n\n3. \"Triss takes advantage of Geralt's amnesia in the Witcher 1 by not telling him about Yen or Ciri.\"\n\nAgain, how much of this is the first 2 games' weird writing and how much is Triss being awful? At this time, Geralt doesn't remember Yen or Ciri, and players can initiate a romance with Triss. Some call Triss being intimate with Geralt in this state cruel or exploitative, because she fails to inform him about his relationship with Yen. However, EVERY character that knew Geralt prior to the amnesia (the other witchers, Dandelion, Zoltan and Shani) also refuse to tell Geralt about his past. This isn't an attempt by Triss to steal him away from Yen, because at this point in the story EVERYONE else in Geralt's life assumes Yen and Ciri are dead, and they are all equally silent. Zoltan and Dandelion actively encourage Geralt's relationship with Triss, after all.\n\nSo why does no one tell him? Well, the games claim that Geralt has to remember or relearn who he is by himself, and an attempt by anyone else to tell him who he is would mould him into their warped perceptions of \"the real Geralt\". Triss in the books has a very selective view of Geralt. She thinks he's gallant and dashing, and she swoons at his every mention, so it's natural she'd acknowledge this bias and not want to force him into being this person. In the same way, Dandelion would embellish Geralt into a cartoonishly extravagant version of himself, and the other witchers don't have the full picture of who he is either.\n\n\n4. \"Geralt loves Yen, not Triss.\"\n\nThe games kind of provide the best possible answer as to why Geralt might love them both. In the books, Geralt only ever loved Yen. However, their love affair was begun by Geralt tying their fates with a Djinn's wish. They frequently get into awful rows and separate for long stretches, only for fate (or love) to force them back together. The caveat with them is that they can't be certain whether the wish (or genuinely feelings) keep them together. However, in his obsession with Yen, he doesn't entertain the thought of loving anyone else.\n\nWhen Geralt develops amnesia in the first game and forgets Yen, he develops feelings for Triss, because he's not got the same single-minded focus on Yen that he had before. When Yen re-enters the picture in Witcher 3, Geralt remembers his feelings for her and they're both on perfectly even footing. The choice is really down to the player as to which is better for Geralt, and that's for the best. Neither seems implausible, if you're willing to detach the games ever so slightly from the books. It's understandable that book lore purists will have a hard time doing this.\n\n\nFeel free to debate me down in the comments.",

        "body": "hello mutants, so i just got done with the 4th book, and id like to sum up the books in terms of content, meaning the major themes. Might be some of you agree and some dont, id love to read your comments.\n\nSo, first book was the last wish, i thoroughly enjoyed it. It introduced the world perfectly, with the monsters and everything. Id say so far its got the most fantasy like feel in the series, not counting the last three books of course. The short stories were great.\n\n2nd book, the sword of destiny, things got darker compared to the first book. and had more of a connected story between chapters. I see why they suggested it to be read second, building up the main story, but i feel it didnt quite grip me like the first (or second) book, thus would have preffered to have read it first.\n\n3rd book, LOVED IT! perfect balance of politics, drama, and action. esp the parts with the ambushes and the non humans backstory.\n\nFourth book was slow at first, then came the full blown head severing, thrusting and dismembering action, right up to the end. Also very entertaining. And we get to see the badass entrance of the  white flame.\n\nTBH, the variety in the writing style is keeping me curios as to what ill encounter in the last books haha.",

        "body": "  Hi Fantasy Folks! I am back with a few more reviews. I am doing a genre triangle where I read a fantasy book, a horror book and then a SF book. This is to keep myself from burning out as well as to keep my reading fresh. (I have done previous book reviews for my SF books on r/printSF and for the horror books on r/horrorlit as an FYI if you like those genres as well). Preamble over! Let's review. \n\nLowest reviewed to highest.\n\n**Sword of Destiny by Andrzej Sapkowski**\n\nBasic Outline- The second short story collection for The Witcher. More adventures of Geralt of Rivia! Dragon hunts, dryads and death abound in this collection which develops and cements relationships with characters who will be integral to the main series. \n\nThoughts- I technically read the books out of order since I started with the Last Wish (correct) but skipped over this one and went right into the main series reading Blood of Elves and recently Time of Contempt. I previously reviewed Time of Contempt and mentioned that it saved my Witcher readthrough after liking The Last Wish but really struggling though Blood of Elves. I was interested to get back to some short stories featuring Geralt since The Last Wish is probably my favourite book so far, however, I found Sword of Destiny to be much more of a mixed bag. The stories I enjoyed the most were The Bounds of Reason and Sword of Destiny with the somewhat fun romp of Eternal Flame being a distant third. It also featured probably my least favourite story I have read in this series A Little Sacrifice which was beyond ridiculous and cringeworthy. Its strange to say that despite being overall disappointed in this collection I would recommend it since it did feature some important character development between Ciri and Geralt which didn’t impede my enjoyment of the main series but could have elevated it had I read this first. I felt like the side stories in The Last Wish were just better told and more interesting than what was featured here. I would still continue reading more collections like this from Sapkowski because the world and characters are so compelling even if they aren’t all hits.  \n\nRating-3/5 stars. A weaker collection than The Last Wish with some quality stories or character moments sprinkled within. \n\n**Excalibur by Bernard Cornwell**\n\nBasic Outline- Book 3 of The Warlord Chronicles. Derfel completes his tale of Arthur and the battle for Britain. Who lives? Who dies? Who is forever changed?\n\nThoughts- You will see below how much I gushed about book 2 in this series and in my previous post for book 1. This series rocks. If you like historical fiction, have an interest in Arthurian lore or just want some awesome medieval intrigue/battles/setting do yourself a favour and get these now. I think this book’s major problem is that book 2 was SO strong. As a result this book is a tiny bit disappointing in comparison. There were some great character moments as usual including a redemption which I was shocked by and was surprised Cornwell wrote well enough to convince me of the change in the character (I was totally against them). A few great comeuppance moments for characters you hate and a truly heartfelt moment between two characters who in different circumstances would be working together. Some things felt a little rushed and the ending was slightly a miss for me (mostly I wished the framing story got one more sequence at the end). \n\nRating-4/5 stars. The trilogy as a whole would be 5/5 since it is so hard to write a full trilogy this consistently well. READ IT. \n\n**The Black Company by Glen Cook**\n\nBasic Outline- The Black Company takes any commission no matter the job. Full of black hearts, hard men and true brotherhood. When enlisted by the ultimate villainess The Lady to lead her armies against the Rebels will the brothers break or succeed in casting The Lady’s shadow over all?\n\nThoughts- I had heard this series was the grim dark subgenres founding tome. I would have to agree but it’s a little less “everyone sucks” to “everyone sucks for a reason” in which case it is the brotherhood that binds the characters together. It does really read like an analogue for the Vietnam war which I believe was Cook’s intention where people realize they are doing mostly the wrong thing but are bound by powerful orders and camaraderie for the man next to them. Cook writes great characters but at first I was slightly overwhelmed with names, places and concepts but once I was about halfway in it all settled down and I began to really enjoy the world he had built. If I was to be reductive The Black Company is sort of like if you were in the Lord of the Rings but were following a group of mercenaries enlisted into Sauron’s army and regularly fighting under the Witch King of Angmar. There is so much to engage with especially with the in fighting between the Taken and their different personalities and abilities. My favourite stuff though had to do with the actual people operating in the Black Company itself. Croaker is a great MC with flaws and fancies (some of which entangle him badly by the end of the book) and the three main wizards in the company One-Eye, Silent and Goblin all offer an interesting more mundane magic mixed with pure comedy when they are pranking and riling each other up. At first I wasn’t really sure where Cook was going with this story but by the end I am hooked and super interested in seeing where we go in this fantasy epic. \n\nRating- 4/5 stars. Great characters and an intriguing plot set in a bleak dark world. A great start for a larger series which I am excited to explore more of. \n\n**The Blacktongue Thief by Christopher Buehlman**\n\nBasic Outline- Kinch Na Shannack is a humble member of the Takers Guild. Unfortunately for Kinch he also owes them a large amount of gold. That is because they taught him how to knife fight, cloak himself, lock pick and most importantly thieve. In exchange for his debt he is sent on a dangerous mission to track down a lost Queen whose kingdom has been ransacked by giants. It was a large debt, ok? \n\nThoughts- Christopher Buehlman was put on my radar not because of his fantasy work but his well regarded horror novels. In particular his medieval horror mashup *Between Two Fires* which is lauded all over horrorlit. In my attempt to track that book down I found this one to be the only Buehlman book available on my discount book site. The cover blurb sounded interesting and it seemed well regarded so I decided to place the order. It was a ton of fun. That is the best way to describe this book. At first I was a little worried since the MC was a little overly snarky but he grew on me as the book went on. The cast of characters and the world building Buehlman introduces is fascinating and I particularly loved the dynamics between the various kingdoms and the explanation toward history which puts women in charge of many roles many fantasy books would automatically give to men. It has some great set pieces including a fantastic ship sequence and the most memorable tug of war you will ever experience. It is very much a part one kind of book so go in knowing that this is not self contained and will not give you all the answers you are looking for. I am much looking forward to the sequel which is coming out soon and even more excited to see what he does in the horror genre (since he does have some very effecting descriptions of scary situations). \n\nRating-4/5 stars. A great start to a new fantasy series. The characters are colourful and the world is vibrant and most importantly fun. \n\n**Enemy of God by Bernard Cornwell**\n\nBasic Outline- Book 2 of 3 of The Warlord Chronicles. Arthur continues his attempt to unite and solidify Briton. Supported by his faithful friend (and narrator) Derfel he will be beset by Saxons, religious strife and betrayal. \n\nThoughts- These books are so good. They just put you in such a specific place and you feel a part of the atmosphere. The battle sequences are amazing and the characters once again are brilliantly painted by Cornwell as flawed but relatable. I try to keep these reviews as spoiler free as possible but there are moments in this book where I was so wrapped up in the losses that certain characters go through that I felt as passionate as they did. Cornwell really pushes the story along in this one and I am almost afraid of where we go next because it felt like a tragedy was brewing even in book 1 but now things seem truly on the brink. The villains are so slowly developed that when certain ones were introduced in book 1 I was laughing while describing them to my fiancée since our narrator holds them in such contempt but by this book they become real threats and I hate them with such a passion. I really don’t have a lot of negatives to say about this book or series perhaps certain parts take a little to develop but once they do it is like a rollercoaster. Certainly, the last hundred pages or so had me gripping the book with rage and anticipation but we will have to wait for book 3 for the conclusion and I for one cannot wait. \n\nRating- 4.5/5 stars. I think when all is said and done this trilogy as a whole will be a 5 star recommend for me (unless the 3rd book really drops the ball). Amazing characters, atmosphere and story if you like Arthurian trappings you need to read these like now!\n\n**THANKS FOR READING!**\n\nIf you want to read my previous fantasy reviews I will post the link here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/15b05qn/summer\\_reading\\_reviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/15b05qn/summer_reading_reviews/)\n\nBooks reviewed include: The Time of Contempt, Fairy Tale, The Blade Itself, Before they are Hanged, The Last Argument of Kings and The Winter King. \n\n**Potential Options Upcoming books:**\n\nOwned- Legends & Lattes by Baldree, Shadows Linger & The White Rose Company by Cook, Tooth & Claw by Walton\n\nWishlist- Shadow of the Gods by Gwynne, Assassin’s Apprentice by Hobb and Best Served Cold by Abercrombie.",

        "body": "My favourite type of character in fantasy is the kind that's super competent, a bit depressed, but also kinda grumpy and a little shit. These characters are powerful, strategic and maybe even feared, acts like a total ass hole, but their hearts are in the right place and they do their best to help their friends and do what's right.\n\nHowever, by themselves I think these characters can be a bit much. The BEST is when they're paired with someone, whether a group of friends, a partner or a lover who is goofy, weird or maybe a bit dumb and they tend to banter or rip on the serious character.\n\nI think what makes this dynamic so compelling is that the serious character is usually someone who has given up on life, or has a lot of issues, so as a reader you feel this sense of sympathy or pity and want to see that character be happy. And it's lovely seeing the sunshine characters provide that in some way.\n\nSome places I've seen this are (these are all from books, games and tv shows):\n\n* Kaladin/Bridge 4 (Stormlight Archive)\n* Sec-Unit/ART and humans from Preservation (Murderbot Diaries)\n* Geralt/Dandelion and some of the other side characters (The Witcher book series)\n* >!Emet-Selch/Scions and Hythlodaeus !<(Final Fantasy 14)\n* Trafalgar Law/Straw Hat crew (One Piece)\n* Harry Dresden/Bob (Dresden Files)\n* Mandalorian/Grogu (The Mandalorian)\n\nI'm wondering if there are other books, tv shows, or games people have seen this dynamic? And just to be clear, this dynamic **doesn't need** to be romantic (though I'm cool with that). More than anything, I like to see the banter between the grumpy/sunshine characters. It also doesn't need to be between protagonist and side characters. It could also be the antagonist between the protagonist etc etc.",

I felt the side quest adventures were a fun way of getting to know the characters. \n\nTherefore I 100% see why it's almost essential to read those before starting BOE. Not from a stance of understanding the story, but moreso for the caring for the characters. \n\nI did enjoy the book, but it was so different than the previous 2 novels. Geralt was missing from a guesstimate of more than 50% of the book, and if BOE was my introduction to Geralt, Dandelion, Yennefer, and othersI don't think this book would have made me care. It feels very much like its a set up book. I hope Geralt does not feel so much as a side character in the rest of the series. \n\nI really loved the caravan chapter, the Yennefer and Ciri training and the training at Kaer Morhen. I did enjoy the book overall, but I am very happy I read the short story novels first. Ciri was the star of the book for sure. \n\nCan't wait to start Time of Contempt!",

        "body": "The major studios invested huge money to the right of well-established IPs like Netflix's The Witcher, Amazon's The Wheel of Time and Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power. All three adaptations share the same mistakes:\n\n1. Uninspired writing: The intricate plots, well-developed characters, and nuanced themes that made the source materials compelling were oversimplified and altered to the point that barely keep any connection to the source material. This can be particularly evident in the dialogues and interactions, where the emotion and depth present in the source materials was replaced with clichés or generic lines. Rings of Power made Celebrimbor a fool who is taking ideas from others  and seemingly just learns about alloying materials.\n2. Uninspired visuals: Visuals is a crucial role in conveying the atmosphere and tone of a story and  giving non-verbal traits to the characters. In all three cases the costumes, locations all forgettable and generic. Rings of Power looks good but nothing extraordinary, meanwhile Wither and Wheel of Time just awfully cheap looking.\n3. Uninspired plotlines: Another common issue that the adaptations are significantly alter storylines due to implementing too much of the writers' own ideas or misunderstanding the source material. This is resuling the loss of key subplots, character development arcs or crucial twists that contributed to the richness of the original narrative. A good example for this when Witcher's S2 was leading the story into the corner and S3 just abandoned the major plot decisions and the show lost consistency completely. Yen is Ciri's mother just because and she is forgiven by the sorcerers just because.",

Not only is he a witcher, but he is a special witcher with white hair and even more mutations.
