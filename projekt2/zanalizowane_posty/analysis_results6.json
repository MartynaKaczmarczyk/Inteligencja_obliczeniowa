I also know geralt as a person so much more as well, which makes decision making so much easier knowing what his answer would be from reading the books. Gotta say, the game captured the vision of the author to a T and added so much more. Feel like this playthrough is even more enjoyable than my first time",

        "title": "A thought about season 2. [SPOILERS]",
        "body": "A strange thought occurred to me while watching the second season.\n\nObviously, **HUGE SPOILERS to *ALL BOOKS*** and Netflix’s series. **If you are planning to read the books, *proceed with CAUTION***.\n\nI was somewhere mid-season, when I thought *\"Well... They claimed to carefully treat the source material in season 2...And when I think about it now, they actually did, but not the way I was expecting\"*.\nThe bottom line is - they actually **did** pay attention to the books, but looks like they intended to **completely reverse** almost everything they could. \nI'm serious, look at this:\n\n- **Books**: Tissaia is an extremely restrained and orderly person that doesn't trust Vilgefortz. \"There is nothing more pathetic than a sorceress in tears\". She's pedantic, rules and order are everything to her.\n  \n**Series**: Tissaia sleeps with Vilgefortz and takes his side in the Brotherhood's matters. She spends more screen time crying than not. In Sodden she uses magic that is borderline (if not) necromancy, in Aretusa she breaks the rules and tortures a prisoner.\n\n- **Books**: Yennefer looses her ability to have children, which leads her to alienate from the Brotherhood, she spends a great deal of her time trying to fix it and have children. She has no thirst for power. She never for a second thinks of betraying Geralt. She cares for Ciri from the moment they meet, even though she hides it very well. Yennefer has elven roots but it has literally no effect on her life.\n\n**Series**: All she cares for is power, and when she loses magic, she is ready to do literally everything to get it back, even betraying Geralt. She is trying convince Fringilla that mages didn't took anything from them, but instead gave them power and taught them how to influence kings. She doesn't care for Ciri and betrays Geralt by taking her away from him, and later even tries to bargain Ciri to get her magic back. Almost everything bad that happens to Yennefer is somehow tied to the fact that she has elven roots.\n\n- **Books**: Eskel is a kind-hearted, gentle-mannered, respectful and smart witcher, a brother-figure to Geralt. Vesemir is a sword master who knows nothing about turning boys to witchers, and he **DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT**. He is not vengeful, he is a kind and welcoming character, also orderly and self-restraint, he does not endanger anyone needlessly.\n \n**Series**: Eskel is an immature asshole who turns Kaer Morhen into a whorehouse, who just shouts out how he hates everyone around him. Vesemir now knows how to create mutagens and mutate people into witchers. He is easily convinced to turn Ciri into a witcher, and he wants to breed more witchers (even though he saw with his own eyes what this line of thinking did to his teacher and Kaer Morhen in Nightmare of the Wolf). If it wasn't for Geralt, he'd turn Ciri into a witcher and later would without second thought kill her because she was possessed by a demon. \n\n- **Books**: The Elves are not innocent beings, they have committed **genocide** towards dwarves and gnomes, and before that to other species. They know how to wage wars and kill, they are **as racist and cruel as humans**, but they've lost the war with humans for biological and cultural reasons. They do not seek any alliances with men, let alone submitting to any human being, because they believe to be superior to anyone. During our time the Northern Kingdoms started to go after elves **because of the continuous raids on human villages** and partisanship, encouraged by Nilfgaard. \n \n**Series**: The Elves are innocent beings that don't even know how to defend themselves, they only resort to cruelty and violence when they are pushed far enough by humans. They easily submit themselves to be soldiers fighting for Nilfgaard.\n\n- **Books**: The Brotherhood understands the consequences for them of Nilfgaard conquering the North, so the Chapter orders wizards to go and fight in Sodden, and they go and fight there. After the battle Vilgefortz gets a huge amount of respect and influence among mages for his actions in battle and for his role in settling a peace between Nilfgaard and the North. \n \n**Series**: The Brotherhood is indifferent to fate of both Cintra and the North, they order all the mages to stand down. A group of mages under Vilgefortz's command disobeys orders. After the battle it is clear that Yennefer is the main reason for victory, but she has to step down for political reasons and let Vilgefortz claim victory and respect, even though he barely did anything and doesn't deserve it.\n\n - **Books**: Jaskier understands the importance of what's happening, he saw what Nifgaardians did in Cintra and wants to somehow help the North, so he becomes a spy for Dijkstra. He is a **loyal friend** to Geralt, so he doesn't give Riens any valuable information under the torture, so that Riens has no clues on how to find Geralt or Ciri\n \n**Series**: Jaskier helps elves to escape to Nilfgaard. He **hates Geralt** and doesn't give Riens any intel because he has none. So Riens **just teleports to Kaer Morhen**, a place which location he has no idea of, and he doesn't kill anyone, even though he is a vicious bastard that never leaves witnesses if there is an opportunity. \n\n- **Books**: (Dijkstra is one of the most accurate characters is S2, but still there is a little detail that bothers me) Dijkstra is a spy, he **never ever** gets his own hands dirty under any circumstances. He is quite literally Varys from GOT.\n\n **Series**: Dijkstra kills two mages in front of his king - with a dagger and poison. \n\n- **Books**: The kings of Northern Kingdoms in Hagga decide that Ciri is dangerous to them alive, since Emhyr wants to marry her to rightfully claim Cintra, and they don't trust each other enough to take her into custody and secretly marry her to claim Cintra for themselves. They come to a conclusion that she needs to be killed. They **understand** that this is wrong, they **feel bad** that they have to do it.\n \n**Series**: The kings decide to kill Ciri just because Emhyr wants her, and they behave like murdering a child for such reason is no big deal at all.\n\n - **Books**: Ciri doesn't have any controllable magic abilities until after *weeks and months* of hard training with Yennefer.\n \n**Series**: Ciri successfully opens a portal at her first attempt in an extremely stressful situation.\n\n- **Books**: Witchers are killing monsters and demons.\n\n**Series**: Witchers incarcerated an extremely dangerous demon that can possess humans, instead of killing for no freaking given reason at all.\n\n - **Books**: Kahyr is a logical character, which looks like an enemy until we see things from *his perspective*. \n  \n**Series**: Kahyr is a ruthless and evil guy from the start. There is no way he can come up with a meaningful redemption arc.\n \n- **Books**: Calanthe is a reasonable woman that's **not** proud of her war victories, she **doesn't hate** elves, she respects and admires Geralt, and even though she had a moment when she wanted to kill Geralt so that he couldn't claim Ciri, she quickly changes her mind, and after that even offers him to come and claim Ciri anytime he wants.\n \n**Series**: Calanthe is a barbarian brute that **celebrates and proud of** the number of elves she killed. She openly mocks Nilfgaardian ambassadors in front of nobles from other countries. She has no respect for Geralt, she deceives and imprisons him when he comes to Cintra to claim Ciri. \n\n- **Series**: Geralt: *\"I will kill Yennefer\"*. What?! Seriously? Geralt that I know would never kill her, even when he believes that she betrayed him, he comes to this conclusion when there is no other possible explanation that he could see, and even then he feels sad and depressed, not hateful and doesn't want to kill her.\n\n**Books**: Nivellen is not aware of who Vereenna is, he took her in for a long period of time because she wasn't scared of him. When he realizes what she is, he helps Geralt to kill her. The end is bittersweet, since he experiences true love, but she turns out to be a monster, and after her death and his curse lifted, he's happy but at the same time sad. Moral of the story: *true love is a very powerful force*.\n\n**Series**: Nivellen knows that she is a vampire, that she butchered a whole village, and he *doesn't care*. He even lets her feed on himself. All because she loves him. When she is killed he almost blames Geralt and becomes suicidal. Moral of this story: if you make a mistake (like he raped a priestess not really knowing what he did) you don't get redemption, you are as much a moster as a bruxa that massacres villages and you *deserve to be torn apart by suicidal thoughts and not being brave enough to kill yourself*.\n\n**EDIT:** *Addition to Nivellen’s story*: Geralt states in the first book (and season 1 epiosode 1), that he is **not the one to judge anyone**, since he also did some very bad shit and made serious mistakes in his life which led to innocent casualties and unnecessary deaths. So when he hears Nivellen's story **he doesn't judge him**. He sees that Nivellen is not a bad guy, but rather was trapped in bad circumstances and didn't opt out in time, which led to him making serious mistakes. Book Geralt understands that. This is why he ***doesn’t say*** anything when he hears that Nivellen raped the girl. In the series the disgusted look on his face after Nivellen confesses is **out of character** and completely diminishes the original point. \n\n**Addition 2**: In the books Nivellen says that he ended up with bad company, and since they were the only thing he had, he tried to keep up with them so he wouldn’t be completely alone. But he’s actually not this kind of guy that would rape a random girl. I don’t say he’s blameless, **he’s done some serious awful mistakes**, and should be punished for this, which he actually is. I’m just saying that in the books he gets his punishent, first by being cursed and left alone, then by losing the one he loved and cared for, and once again being alone. In the books his punishment is complete and the lift of the curse symbolizes his redemption (as I can see it), and he has some future ahead of him. In the series he is left heartbroken, hating himself, Ciri and Geralt leaving him with an expression of disgust for him, he literally begs Geralt to kill him.\n\nAnd this list goes on and on and on (I just don't have enough patience to remember something more), from little details to large events, characters and their motivations. And this series is a complete opposite of adaptation.\n\nFeel free to point out the opposites I’ve missed and let me know what you think about it.,",

        "body": "Looks like the writers jumped the gun and introduced Ciri jumping between worlds (her most powerful ability) and treat it like it's something normal. It was completely out of the blue without any explanation or reason what so ever. And she learned how to do it in a instant. Jumped to another world with Yen and Geralt and brought them back to the same space and time.\n\nCiri is very interesting character without \"Powers\" I don't understand why they felt that it's needs to be shown now destroying entire Ciri story arc.\n\nI don't know how S03 gonna follow the books closer with all the wrong, unjustified plot points they introduced in the S02. It makes no sense. Now she can say \"fuck fuck fuck\" like she did for the first time she teleported in the show and jump wherever she pleases.\n\nHer entire arc is ruined.\n\nIn the books Ciri did not jump space and time until 5th book (if I am not mistaken) and it was only with a help of a \"Konik\" a Unicorn, then eventually she learned how to control it to some degree. Entire 5th books in about her trying to get back to the world she comes from but here we are, in the show she can just do it no problem.",

        "body": "I enjoyed second season a lot, including the stuff that wasnt in the book, until episodes 7 and 8. \n\n-First, the whole Yennefer character. Its different character. She is simply unlikable, she doesnt have solid core, she runs from one extreme to another like some kid, and not 100yo sorceress. Its impossible to look at her and think \"Yeah, thats the furious hound that would protect Ciri at all cost from the very beginning\". She seriously wanted to harm Ciri, Geralt's child.\n\n-Vesemir. They straight butchered him. What the hell was that. Dont give me \"its an adaptation\" excuse, they turned Vesemir from Eps 2, 3 and 4 into an absolutely different character - unwise, rush, merciless etc. He tried to kill Ciri and fought against Geralt. WTF?\n\n-Yennefer and Ciri has no chemistry at all. Triss became better mother figure to Ciri in the show in less screen time. What was that?\n\n-Yennefer and Geralt lost all their chemistry at all. Their last dialogue was terrible. Writers basically made them divorced parents who dont love each other and only agreed to communicate because they have a kid, while the beauty of their couple in the source material was that they LOVED each other and Ciri gave them the chance to fulfill their love.\n\n-Geralt fights Ciri. The hell.\n\n-Posessed Ciri killed some witchers, her brothers, with basically no self-reflection on Ciri side.\n\n-The whole Voleth Meir line was integrated badly into Ciri story line. She was all about finding her place, whether its being a witcher or sorceress or prophet, and they put the absolutely separate arc resolution as the resolution of her arc for this season. Why couldnt they just made Yennefer possessed instead and use it as the tool to show how Geralt love and Ciri's powers helped her? It would have brought us to the same conclusion without the butchering of numerous characters and dynamic.\n\nTo me it seemed like eps 7 and 8 writers didnt even read the  scripts of previous episodes. Im disappointed. I loved first 6 episodes despite Eskel story, and last two episodes literally took carefully written and build characters and crushed them into dust. \n\nAt least the build up for the next Season seems solid.",

And he kinda admits to going soft so I'm not terrible sure how much of a silent big white haired witcher profile is left with that personality change. I feel like it would be more enjoyable to watch him have soft moments instead of going soft altogether. Like when he said \"jaskier you are okay\" in season 1. Subtle but valuable \"softness\"\nAnd there weren't as many jaskier songs this season compared to the first season right?",

Therefore, there is actually no need to call a banquet to discuss the growing dissent between mages and royalty. \n\nTissaia herself is also in on the whole hunt after Ciri, which adds another complication to the entire thing. She's clearly being manipulated by Vilgefortz, in hopes of guarding Ciri, which is perhaps why she might suggest to Yennefer to bring her to Aretuza where she could be trained in secret. \n\nI just don't see a single reason to hold a banquet now - we saw Foltest talking about how they couldn't trust their advisors any longer during the memorial for the fallen of the Sodden Hill but in the finale, this doesn't seem to be a problem as Tissaia herself is present as well at their meeting.",

Some of the liberties they took with the script I thought were interesting, although I will say that episode 3 I had figured out all the connections and called the ending. Some people dislike it, I kind of enjoy it but it’s no fun if I can unravel the whole thing in one go, give me a little mystery to toy with.\nI did feel that the script was too bloated.\nIn the books Ciri and Geralt have a very equal relationship and they do joke around, not a lot of that this season unfortunately. I really hate what they did to Yen, for various reasons I am a lot like Yen, having her basically grovel for Geralt to love her? C’mon. I thought it was compelling to look at Yen if everything had been taken from her but I feel like Yen wouldn’t have gone to the brotherhood but just to Tissaia she also would have tried everything-So show that.\nThey butchered Vesemir, I think Kim’s portrayal was good but it all comes down to script. They villainized Vesemir, which isn’t a good look when you’re introducing a character the audience is intended to adore.\nNo TV show has ever followed source material, so I feel like that was a foolish and illogical assumption which let you all down, expectations are a bitch, learn to suspend them. Looking at the series for what it was I thought it was an interesting take but ultimately too full, several plot lines could have been culled.",

        "body": "Lauren clearly does listen to the fan feedback. Things that were fixed in S1 and treated with care:\n- Geralt. Noticeably fewer hmms and grunts. He actually talks and expresses emotion. \n\n- Triss. Not only did they change her look, clearly there was a lot of care put into her character. That's a book Triss for the most part. Her relationships with Ciri, Geralt, and the other witchers are on point. I'm not Team Triss at all, but I liked her a lot in this season and actually felt for her when Geralt rejected her.\n\n- Jaskier. His appearance is now more in line with game Dandelion. There was clearly lots of thought put into his characterization, his relationships with Geralt and Yen, his song lyrics. Geralt actually apologized to him, and I can't remember him apologizing often (or ever?) in the show. \n\nHaving said that, the characters/relationships that the show creators fucked up:\n\n- Yennefer. Yen in S2 didn't even seem like the same woman from S1. She was a lot softer--until she decided to betray Geralt (and by extension Ciri). As a result, her relationship with both isn't what it should have been. I felt like Geralt had no chemistry with Yen this season. Their relationship was like that of a divorced couple who have no idea how to act around each other anymore. Because of Yen's betrayal, I wasn't even sure why Yen was there next to Ciri and Geralt at the end--she seemed very out of place. Either Triss or Jaskier would have been more fitting in that scene. Yen just seemed to be there because the show creators put her there, not because she earned her place in the family.\n\n- Vesemir. He was flat often. His emotions sometimes didn't land. Part of it was the writing, part of it might be the acting. Either way, he didn't feel like a wise father figure for Geralt and the others. It often didn't even seem like Geralt respected him much. The characterization was off.\n\nIt's still a good show, and I liked what they did with Geralt, Triss, and Jaskier, but those few issues were pretty glaring and didn't allow the season to be truly great.",

        "body": "Heavy spoilers for the books and Season 2!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not all-encompassing. I'll forget some changes--Heaven knows the writers made enough changes. I'll also preface this by saying: This isn't a commentary on the quality of the season itself. It is simply a collection of the differences between the novel and the show.\n\n**Characters**\n\n* Voleth Meir is not in the books. Completely new character.\n* Geralt wouldn't use Ciri as bait in the books. Nor did he.\n* Ciri is never possessed by a witch.\n* Yennefer does not lose her magic in the books.\n   * Yennefer never considers sacrificing Ciri for power. Nor does the opportunity ever arise.\n* Yennefer is not captured by Niilfgard in the books.\n   * Instead, she is blinded following Sodden after taking a fireball to the face from Fringilla. She then spends lots of time in recovery, then--on Dijkstra's orders--tails and saves Dandelion from Rience.\n   * No one ever thinks she's dead in the books either (Geralt worries that she died after Sodden, if I recall, but finds out rather quickly she's still out there after visiting the Sodden memorial)\n* Later in the series (Post Time of Contempt/Late Season 3 or early Season 4 by comparison), people suspect Yennefer of being a Nilfgaardian spy. But at no point does anyone suspect her of being a spy following Sodden.\n* In the book, Triss is the Fourteenth mage who died at Sodden Hill (she didn't actually die, but everyone thought she did). In the show, Yennefer becomes the Fourteenth mage who died at Sodden Hill\n* The Stregobor stuff isn't a thing in the books. He's there, but plays no important role.\n* Vessemir wouldn't try to use Ciri's blood to create more witchers in the books. Nor would he ever allow Ciri to undergo the Trial. Nor would he let Eskel bring a bunch of hookers to Kaer Morhen\n* In the books, Dandelion is actively working with Djikstra and the Redanian Secret Service. ~~This is removed in the show~~ It is implied that Djikstra is funding Dandelion's sandpiper activities, though Dandelion doesn't seem to be aware of who he is working with. This is speculative on my part though.\n   * Also in the books, Dandelion is not nearly as comedic as he was in Season 2. He is funny, but they seemed to lean into that aspect of him for Season 2.\n   * This is more my interpretation, but in the books, Dandelion is far wittier than he is in the show. He certainly doesn't come across as the type to talk to rats in the book.\n* Djikstra is not a rambling drunk in the books (although I didn't find that to be a bad change. It was pretty interesting IMO).\n* I don't believe Istredd even appears in Blood of Elves\n* Francesa Findabar is *not* with the Scoia'tael in the books. By this, I mean she's not in the field with them, acting as their leader.\n   * She is a member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, though she does harbor sympathies for their cause and occasionally meets with Scoia'tel leaders (Filavandrel, as an example). This relationship becomes relevant when she aids Niilfgaard during the Coup at Thanned\n* Fringilla Vigo does not become de facto leader of Cintra in the books. Instead, she fucks off to Niilfgard\n* Cahir is not captured by the Brotherhood following Sodden in the books. I don't even recall if he was at Sodden. As far as I recall, he traveled back to Niilfgard following the Fall of Cintra, and was imprisoned for failing to capture Ciri. We don't see him again for another two books after Sodden.\n   * His execution plot-point never happened in the books.\n   * Book Cahir is also not nearly as mustache-twirly-evil-villain as he is in the show. Cahir fans will know what I mean.\n* Tissaia is hardly a significant character in the books.\n   * Though when she is in the books, she explicitly does not trust the hero-act that Vilgefortz puts on. She is suspicious of him.\n* Rience is not a magical bounty hunter in the books. He's an almost fanatical follower of Vilgefortz in the books.\n   * Rience is scarred in the show and books, but in the books, it's because Yennefer uses her magic to wound him as he's interrogating Dandelion.\n* Lydia Van Bredevoort does not develop her scars from sniffing a vial of elder blood in the books. Instead, her scars are a result of magical experimentation on Vilgefortz' orders, and her wounds are hidden with an illusion.\n* Eskel is not turned into a Leshen and then killed (as far as we know. He's not in the books for long.)\n* Vilgefortz and Tissaia are not a romantic thing, as far as I could tell. Nor are they really even partners. Vilgefortz is also the genuine champion of Sodden in the books. He does this to gain more authority in the Brotherhood.\n   * Vilgy is also way stronger and smarter in the books then how he is depicted in the show. Also, Vilgy never says his classic line. This is a cardinal sin, imo.\n* Nenekke is an old and religious lady. She doesn't go around dropping f-bombs in the books.\n* Emhyr kept the fact that Ciri was his daughter a big secret in the books. Understandable, given his plans for her (**cough** Imperial Incest **cough**)\n* Jarre in the books is a bit of a geek, who is very clearly awkward around girls, and has a crush on Ciri. But he's also smart, and good-intentioned. The show reduces him to a dick joke.\n* Phillipa plays a much larger role in the book. She meets Geralt in Oxenfurt, and together, with Dandelion and Shani's help, they locate Rience.\n* Shani was in the books. Where the hell is Shani in the show?\n* Coen is a witcher from the gryphon school. However, in the show he bears a wolf school medallion\n\n**Plot Points**\n\n* Except for Ciri's training, there is not a single fight at Kaer Morhen. Never. There is no Leshen, nor is there the centipede thing with the claws. There is no possession.\n   * There are only four witchers at Kaer Morhen (Vessemir, Eskel, Lambert, and Coen)\n   * At Kaer Morhen, Ciri trains and exercises. Eventually, Triss arrives (on Geralt's request) and instructs Ciri on the basics of magic, as well as the Elder language.\n* The plot point with Ciri's blood being able to make more witchers is not in the books.\n   * Vesemir never collects her blood either. The thought of making more witchers is only ever entertained in the context of Ciri being raised as a girl vs. being raised as a witcher. But the mutagenic process itself/Trial of Grasses is never brought up.\n* In the book, Triss travels with Ciri and Geralt to the Temple. In the show, she doesn't. We don't see her get sick.\n   * On the path to the Temple is when they run into Yarpen Zigrin again. This doesn't happen in the show. As a result, Ciri doesn't visit Shaerrawedd, and there is no fight with the Scoia'tael.\n* There is no fight at Melitele's Temple in the books. Never.\n* Yennefer does not travel to the Temple to kidnap Ciri and sacrifice her in the books.\n   * In the books, Ciri and Yennefer stay at the temple for a while. Ciri learns more magic.\n   * Yennefer is invited to the temple by Geralt after Geralt has already left. See the 'Dear Friend,' bullet point further down.\n   * There is no reunion between Geralt and Yennefer in Blood of Elves. They reunite outside Gors Velen in the next book.\n* In the books, Rience does not find Ciri at the Temple. Instead, Geralt leaves Ciri in Nenekke's care to find Rience at Oxenfurt.\n   * While in Oxenfurt, Geralt meets Phillipa, Dandelion, and Shani. They then track and fight Rience.\n      * There is no Shani in the show. >:(\n      * In the show, Phillipa does not help Geralt find Rience, nor does she help Rience escape\n   * In fact, Rience doesn't meet Ciri till the Time of Contempt, which is the next book following Blood of Elves.\n* Dandelion doesn't sing at a tavern in Oxenfurt. He sings at Bleobheris, a sacred tree.\n   * His Sandpiper plot is not a thing in the books.\n   * Dandelion is not arrested in the books.\n* The elf and Cintra plot is not in the books.\n   * There is a non-human uprising in the North in the books, led by the Scoia'tael, but they are not given Cintra as a place of refuge by the Niilfgardians. Instead, Niilfgard is suspected of funding and arming them behind the scenes to stoke instability in the North.\n* Francesca never gets pregnant. Nor does Emhyr commit infanticide against an elven baby in the books.\n   * The notion that a pure-blooded elf hasn't been born in decades is also a Netflix invention. Elves have a much smaller window of time to get pregnant, but it still happens in the books. Avallach and Geralt talk about this in Tower of Swallow.\n* The magical politics is a thing in the books, but is very different from the magical politics in the show. Stregobor does not interrogate or harm Yennefer, and neither do Tissaia/Vilgy use that as an excuse to seize Council seats.\n   * Instead, the magical politics in the book are concerned with the growing distrust between the Kings and their magical advisors\n      * The meeting of the Kings at the end of Season 2 is the meeting of the Kings in BoE that puts the Mages on edge, and is used to justify the Conclave in Time of Contempt. However, Tissaia is at the King's meeting in the show, which is not the case in the book. No mages were invited to the meeting in the books.\n* When the Kings of the North meet, they do conclude it best to kill Ciri--so as to prevent her falling into Emhyr's hands (they don't want him to have a legitimate claim to the Cintran throne). However, the show cut the King's talk of war with Niilfgaard.\n   * In the books, they believe a quick strike across the Yaruga could recapture Cintra, and deal a blow to the South. This conversation paves the way for the Second Great War, but does not happen in the show.\n   * The show also leaves out the politics regarding Cintra's throne. Cordhingrer is visited by Geralt in the books, and they develop a plot to--essentially-- smear Calanthe's name and ruin her claim to the Cintrant throne, thus making Ciri's claim to the throne illegitimate. Thus, protecting her from the kings who want her dead for her political power.\n* Again, the Voleth Meir plot is not in the books at all. Instead, Blood of Elves focuses on Ciri's training and planting the seeds for future conflicts.\n   * I.e. the Second Great War, the Coup of Thanned, Character's motivations to capture Ciri, etc.\n* The Monoliths are not a thing in the books.\n* The 'Dear Friend,' bit is in reference to letters exchanged by Yennefer and Geralt while Geralt is in Oxenfurt hunting for Rience. Geralt asks Yennefer to travel to the temple to train Ciri. Again, Geralt and Yen don't actually meet though.\n* In the books, Niilfgardians are depicted as something more akin to the Romans or English (Highly centralized government with progressive and aristocratic traditions and legal codes). In the books, they are not religious zealots. Though they are also not necessarily 'good' either.\n* Yennefer and Cahir never have a team-up in the books.\n* Tissaia does not recommend that Ciri be captured, nor does she suggest that anyone protecting her be captured as well. In fact, Tissaia's role in the show is dramatically overblown.\n* Ciri is not with Geralt when he meets Nivellen.\n* Istredd does not meet with Cordringer and Fenn in the books. Geralt does meet them to find information about Rience and Ciri.\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that the *majority* of this season is different from the books. And not just sort of different, but drastically different.  Hell, the last four or five episodes are fictitious (relative to the book canon (yes I know it's all fiction, please stop reminding me)) in nearly every way. At this point, I'm not certain where the story will go. For example, how will the Coup play out on Thanedd if Ciri won't be able to attend it? And if Ciri isn't at Aretuza for the Coup, then how will she be warped to the desert? And if she isn't separated from Geralt and Yennefer, then how will she meet up with the Rats?\n\nObviously, they can still work these plots in, or at least, work in the *effects* of these plots, but the story will take a drastically different turn than the one the book tells.\n\nNote that this isn't necessarily a good or a bad thing, so long as it's done well. But there has to come a point when the adaptation is so drastically different from the source material, that I start to wonder whether it's truly an adaptation, or if it's a reimagining.",

        "body": "Heavy spoilers for the books and Season 2!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not all-encompassing. I'll forget some changes--Heaven knows the writers made enough changes. I'll also preface this by saying: This isn't a commentary on the quality of the season itself. It is simply a collection of the differences between the novel and the show.\n\n**Characters**\n\n* Voleth Meir is not in the books. Completely new character.\n* Geralt wouldn't use Ciri as bait in the books. Nor did he.\n* Ciri is never possessed by a witch.\n* Yennefer does not lose her magic in the books.\n   * Yennefer never considers sacrificing Ciri for power. Nor does the opportunity ever arise.\n* Yennefer is not captured by Niilfgard in the books.\n   * Instead, she is blinded following Sodden after taking a fireball to the face from Fringilla. She then spends lots of time in recovery, then--on Dijkstra's orders--tails and saves Dandelion from Rience.\n   * No one ever thinks she's dead in the books either (Geralt worries that she died after Sodden, if I recall, but finds out rather quickly she's still out there after visiting the Sodden memorial)\n* Later in the series (Post Time of Contempt/Late Season 3 or early Season 4 by comparison), people suspect Yennefer of being a Nilfgaardian spy. But at no point does anyone suspect her of being a spy following Sodden.\n* In the book, Triss is the Fourteenth mage who died at Sodden Hill (she didn't actually die, but everyone thought she did). In the show, Yennefer becomes the Fourteenth mage who died at Sodden Hill\n* The Stregobor stuff isn't a thing in the books. He's there, but plays no important role.\n* Vessemir wouldn't try to use Ciri's blood to create more witchers in the books. Nor would he ever allow Ciri to undergo the Trial. Nor would he let Eskel bring a bunch of hookers to Kaer Morhen\n* In the books, Dandelion is actively working with Djikstra and the Redanian Secret Service. ~~This is removed in the show~~ It is implied that Djikstra is funding Dandelion's sandpiper activities, though Dandelion doesn't seem to be aware of who he is working with. This is speculative on my part though.\n   * Also in the books, Dandelion is not nearly as comedic as he was in Season 2. He is funny, but they seemed to lean into that aspect of him for Season 2.\n   * This is more my interpretation, but in the books, Dandelion is far wittier than he is in the show. He certainly doesn't come across as the type to talk to rats in the book.\n* Djikstra is not a rambling drunk in the books (although I didn't find that to be a bad change. It was pretty interesting IMO).\n* I don't believe Istredd even appears in Blood of Elves\n* Francesa Findabar is *not* with the Scoia'tael in the books. By this, I mean she's not in the field with them, acting as their leader.\n   * She is a member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, though she does harbor sympathies for their cause and occasionally meets with Scoia'tel leaders (Filavandrel, as an example). This relationship becomes relevant when she aids Niilfgaard during the Coup at Thanned\n* Fringilla Vigo does not become de facto leader of Cintra in the books. Instead, she fucks off to Niilfgard\n* Cahir is not captured by the Brotherhood following Sodden in the books. I don't even recall if he was at Sodden. As far as I recall, he traveled back to Niilfgard following the Fall of Cintra, and was imprisoned for failing to capture Ciri. We don't see him again for another two books after Sodden.\n   * His execution plot-point never happened in the books.\n   * Book Cahir is also not nearly as mustache-twirly-evil-villain as he is in the show. Cahir fans will know what I mean.\n* Tissaia is hardly a significant character in the books.\n   * Though when she is in the books, she explicitly does not trust the hero-act that Vilgefortz puts on. She is suspicious of him.\n* Rience is not a magical bounty hunter in the books. He's an almost fanatical follower of Vilgefortz in the books.\n   * Rience is scarred in the show and books, but in the books, it's because Yennefer uses her magic to wound him as he's interrogating Dandelion.\n* Lydia Van Bredevoort does not develop her scars from sniffing a vial of elder blood in the books. Instead, her scars are a result of magical experimentation on Vilgefortz' orders, and her wounds are hidden with an illusion.\n* Eskel is not turned into a Leshen and then killed (as far as we know. He's not in the books for long.)\n* Vilgefortz and Tissaia are not a romantic thing, as far as I could tell. Nor are they really even partners. Vilgefortz is also the genuine champion of Sodden in the books. He does this to gain more authority in the Brotherhood.\n   * Vilgy is also way stronger and smarter in the books then how he is depicted in the show. Also, Vilgy never says his classic line. This is a cardinal sin, imo.\n* Nenekke is an old and religious lady. She doesn't go around dropping f-bombs in the books.\n* Emhyr kept the fact that Ciri was his daughter a big secret in the books. Understandable, given his plans for her (**cough** Imperial Incest **cough**)\n* Jarre in the books is a bit of a geek, who is very clearly awkward around girls, and has a crush on Ciri. But he's also smart, and good-intentioned. The show reduces him to a dick joke.\n* Phillipa plays a much larger role in the book. She meets Geralt in Oxenfurt, and together, with Dandelion and Shani's help, they locate Rience.\n* Shani was in the books. Where the hell is Shani in the show?\n* Coen is a witcher from the gryphon school. However, in the show he bears a wolf school medallion\n\n**Plot Points**\n\n* Except for Ciri's training, there is not a single fight at Kaer Morhen. Never. There is no Leshen, nor is there the centipede thing with the claws. There is no possession.\n   * There are only four witchers at Kaer Morhen (Vessemir, Eskel, Lambert, and Coen)\n   * At Kaer Morhen, Ciri trains and exercises. Eventually, Triss arrives (on Geralt's request) and instructs Ciri on the basics of magic, as well as the Elder language.\n* The plot point with Ciri's blood being able to make more witchers is not in the books.\n   * Vesemir never collects her blood either. The thought of making more witchers is only ever entertained in the context of Ciri being raised as a girl vs. being raised as a witcher. But the mutagenic process itself/Trial of Grasses is never brought up.\n* In the book, Triss travels with Ciri and Geralt to the Temple. In the show, she doesn't.

Avallach and Geralt talk about this in Tower of Swallow.\n* The magical politics is a thing in the books, but is very different from the magical politics in the show. Stregobor does not interrogate or harm Yennefer, and neither do Tissaia/Vilgy use that as an excuse to seize Council seats.\n   * Instead, the magical politics in the book are concerned with the growing distrust between the Kings and their magical advisors\n      * The meeting of the Kings at the end of Season 2 is the meeting of the Kings in BoE that puts the Mages on edge, and is used to justify the Conclave in Time of Contempt. However, Tissaia is at the King's meeting in the show, which is not the case in the book. No mages were invited to the meeting in the books.\n* When the Kings of the North meet, they do conclude it best to kill Ciri--so as to prevent her falling into Emhyr's hands (they don't want him to have a legitimate claim to the Cintran throne). However, the show cut the King's talk of war with Niilfgaard.\n   * In the books, they believe a quick strike across the Yaruga could recapture Cintra, and deal a blow to the South. This conversation paves the way for the Second Great War, but does not happen in the show.\n   * The show also leaves out the politics regarding Cintra's throne. Cordhingrer is visited by Geralt in the books, and they develop a plot to--essentially-- smear Calanthe's name and ruin her claim to the Cintrant throne, thus making Ciri's claim to the throne illegitimate. Thus, protecting her from the kings who want her dead for her political power.\n* Again, the Voleth Meir plot is not in the books at all. Instead, Blood of Elves focuses on Ciri's training and planting the seeds for future conflicts.\n   * I.e. the Second Great War, the Coup of Thanned, Character's motivations to capture Ciri, etc.\n* The Monoliths are not a thing in the books.\n* The 'Dear Friend,' bit is in reference to letters exchanged by Yennefer and Geralt while Geralt is in Oxenfurt hunting for Rience. Geralt asks Yennefer to travel to the temple to train Ciri. Again, Geralt and Yen don't actually meet though.\n* In the books, Niilfgardians are depicted as something more akin to the Romans or English (Highly centralized government with progressive and aristocratic traditions and legal codes). In the books, they are not religious zealots. Though they are also not necessarily 'good' either.\n* Yennefer and Cahir never have a team-up in the books.\n* Tissaia does not recommend that Ciri be captured, nor does she suggest that anyone protecting her be captured as well. In fact, Tissaia's role in the show is dramatically overblown.\n* Ciri is not with Geralt when he meets Nivellen.\n* Istredd does not meet with Cordringer and Fenn in the books. Geralt does meet them to find information about Rience and Ciri.\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that the *majority* of this season is different from the books. And not just sort of different, but drastically different.  Hell, the last four or five episodes are fictitious (relative to the book canon (yes I know it's all fiction, please stop reminding me)) in nearly every way. At this point, I'm not certain where the story will go. For example, how will the Coup play out on Thanedd if Ciri won't be able to attend it? And if Ciri isn't at Aretuza for the Coup, then how will she be warped to the desert? And if she isn't separated from Geralt and Yennefer, then how will she meet up with the Rats?\n\nObviously, they can still work these plots in, or at least, work in the *effects* of these plots, but the story will take a drastically different turn than the one the book tells.\n\nNote that this isn't necessarily a good or a bad thing, so long as it's done well. But there has to come a point when the adaptation is so drastically different from the source material, that I start to wonder whether it's truly an adaptation, or if it's a reimagining.",

        "body": "I'll try to avoid spoilers for the show or the books here.\n\nThe show got so far away from its source material that it's a completely different story now. The characters go through some familiar motions, they have the same names and some scenes resemble the books, but the overall plot, the plot points, the story, the character relations and dynamics, the conflicts - it's all original, all new, all separated and removed.\n\nAt the same time, it feels the show tries to cling onto *some tiny parts* of the books - places, some major characters (at least by name), *some* plot points. With how many things were changed, it feels increasingly forced for the viewer. For people who read the books years ago, the changes make little sense and are often very cringy. For some who never read them, the show gets increasingly confusing over time.\n\nI honestly wish the show was a part of the 'expanded universe' and focused on the world 200\\~250 years before the books, before Kaer Morhen, during the early era of first witchers. The story itself, as presented in the show, has legs and would stand on its own. The characters and their relations are not bad per se, they just extremely don't fit the characters if you know them from the original sources. If they were renamed and set in another time, they wouldn't be half bad. \n\nThe ideas, objects and monsters introduced in the latter part of season 2 would *really fit* year 950\\~1000 (as counted by humans of the Continent). It could be expanded into the origin story for Kaer Morhen itself, how a remote keep started being necessary for the early witchers. I absolutely wouldn't mind some creative leeway and introducing Lara Dorren's mother or sister as also 'being extraordinary' to explore that part of the established lore a bit better.\n\nThe story could take a time skip after two or three seasons and move into Falka's rebellion to tie into the main timeline and have a major armed conflict instead of the war with Nilfgaard, and we could see Mirthe as the 'mage school' (or even get to see how Aretuza was founded). \n\nThe most disheartening is that we're not getting a Witcher tv/movie series anytime soon that would stay true to the book material. Putting all creative ideas and changes into an expanded universe story would let us have both over time, and now we're left with just a heavily altered fanfiction loosely based on the novels we know and love.",

        "title": "Thoughts on the show as a show and video game consumer, without having read the books (I come in peace) S2 SPOILERS",
        "body": "As someone who is a show and game (only the first game) consumer of the Witcher universe, I watched S1 and S2 without the knowledge of show to book changes.\n\nI’ve read a lot of posts overcome with vitriol and I’m sure it’s warranted. I was pissed over the book to screen changes in Harry Potter and ASOIAF.\n\nThat said, I thought I’d point out some great points and some areas of opportunity for the Witcher S2 as I see it.\n\nI’m typing on my phone so this won’t be exhaustive per se, but things that stand most starkly now that I’ve finished my first watch. \n\nI’ll start with the areas of opportunity so we can end on a high note:\n\n1. The show didn’t set up the relationship bw Tissaia and her girls in a way that explains her reaction to Yen’s S1 ending or nearly anything about S2. Tissaia abuses most of her girls for most of S1. We don’t see the love and devotion that is depicted later. This extends to Triss. We didn’t see Tissaia develop a POSITIVE relationship w her girls. We only ever saw abuse and manipulation. Yet they believe in her so much from S1E8 and beyond.\n\n2. The Witchers’ eyes weren’t the Witcher yellow until the scenes where the Deathless Mother via Ciri kill them. When their eyes go wide, suddenly they’re yellow after being otherwise the whole season.\n\n3. Ciri’s eyebrows. I don’t know why they changed her eyebrows for S2 but it was a stark distraction. That change made it feel like more time had passed between Sodden and S2 than the actual story indicates. If a time change was the goal, her brows shouldn’t have changed until E3 or later.\n\n4. People seemed to act out of character for our understanding of them to this point. Nothing we’ve seen suggests Vesemir would betray Geralt in the way Vesemir arguably does. He not only takes Ciri’s blood, but starts to get her ready for the trial of the grasses. Yennefer gave Geralt so much shit about abandoning his child surprise, then she essentially kidnaps her, betraying him? I dunno, it felt like folks acted out of their nature for the purpose of having Geralt experience betrayal. Betrayal seemed an undercurrent to the whole season.\n\n5. I don’t think the show did a good enough job of showing us what mages served where and why. I was a little discombobulated by the relationship bw the Brotherhood and Monarchs in S2. There seemed to be great mistrust there but I thought only contra was the sketchy one w the brotherhood. Foltest helped at sodden so it’s confusing why he’s be suspicious of them. \n\nGreat Points:\n\n1. I LOVE how many signs we got to see this season vs last. They really expanded upon the Witcher magic and training in this season. We got to see more places from the game and revisited a lot of characters from S1. I appreciate that continuity.\n\n2. There was some fun self awareness in this season. I enjoyed when someone joked to Jaskier at the docks, “took me four verses to realize there was a time shift” (or something that like that). They leaned into Jasier and Gerat’s juxtaposing demeanors and I enjoyed that.\n\n3. The special effect were really good. The CGI, the prosthetics, I liked em all personally. Nivellin was really cool w the tusks and the hair, the bruxa was disturbing in the best way w her twitchy demeanor and 360 head swivel, the demons and creatures were great, etc.\n\n4. They did a good job expanding Geralt’s world without overburdening our minds with heaps of new characters. We got a few an episode, which really helps us retain their individuality.\n\n5. LOVED the casting choices. Vesemir was perfect. The age gap between Henry and Anya is a little weird if you think about it too long but the actors sell the characters. Even the sex worker Yenn paid was well cast 😂\n\n***note that I won’t respond to trolls, gatekeepers, or bullies.***",

        "body": "You see... you have to understand that this isn't Blood of Elves 1:1 for a starter, and understand the differences in scheme with season 1. Don't think of it trying to match it with the books, it has references to it but it's a new story. And there are disgusting stuff when comparing to the books, like Tissaia & Vilgeforts (who is 34 in the books)\n\n Season 1 is like a full party in every episode: Things are explained, drama is introduced, action scene with an amazing soundtrack and choreography, adventure ends. Next episode is a complete, full party again with a defined begining and ending.\n\nSeason 2 is more like the first episodes seem like pure nonsense (except EP 1, wich follows the scheme of season 1) but it begins to take form as the season progresses. it's centered more in the season as a whole, than on self contained stories. At first I was dissapointed, not going to lie.\n\nIt pararells to the first books, where in The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, we follow Geralt as a monster hunter and the books are just divided in adventures (I really loved the first books btw). After that, in Blood of elves and beyond, the plot follows one main story line.\n\nI learned to love Season 2. It has it's own style, tough my favorite is probably still season 1's way of doing things. Tough, first chapters of season 2 are somewhat hard to digest, they do seem like a lot of nonsense when you don't know the full plot of the season. ~~eskel becomes a tree and dies~~\n\nTough I still believe they did Vessemir dirty, he regrets at the end but if season 2 is conected to Nightmare of The Wolf.... well... Decland told him to make better men of the witchers, not to build a fabric of them again. So points for catharsis I guess. It has it's merits.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the end, just remember that the season 2 is  a new story and is centered more towards the full season. Season 1 was more about self-centered stories. Personally I would have toned up the fight choreographies, I miss the important duels like when Geralt faced Renfri. \n\nSeason 2 had good fights but I liked more the previous ones in Season 1. For example, Geralt and Yen vs other guys in the dragon episode.\n\nIf you have trouble keeping up with Season 2, just chill and enjoy it. What you are not understanding will unfold later.",

So did the witcher games.\n\nI just don't understand why the directors would change the story so much. Its not that its a bad show - if this was a spinoff in the Witcherverse (like the Vesemir anime), I would have liked it. But the characters don't act like themselves - Yen/Vesemir would never risk Ciri's safety, Tissaia would always prioritise rules over relationships, Eskel is gentle and level-headed, and Francesca isn't racist/revengeful to the point of stupidity. If you were going to make a Witcherverse-theme with totally different personalities t...then why not do a whole new series? \"Witcher-inspired\" not \"Based on the Witcher\" for example. \n\nIts hard to judge/score the series when it departs from the original storyline so much and I felt like I've waited forever for what feels like fanfiction. Have the directors ever explained why they made the choices they did? I can see why they might choose to cut out specific parts later on (e.g. >!Ciri being sexually assaulted!<) but all the changes made so far feels unnecessary.",

        "body": "Dear screenwriters, if you want to create your own story, create something new or make separate series (like you did with Blood Origin). As Lauren said herself, the Witcher books are already great and have all the material for a great adaptation. Remember that GoT was best when there were still unadapted books and showrunners followed them.\n\nPlease stop deviating so much from the books. We understand you want your creative freedom and it's impossible to adapt every detail from the books. It is ok to make changes as long as they are subtle and fit the tone/theme of the original. E.g. I liked that you added Ciri to Nivellen's story, it allowed for more scenes with her and Geralt, somewhat making up for the first season.\n\nBut almost always all of your major changes are significantly worse and make no sense.                                       Just some examples which first come to mind: (after both seasons)\n\n* >!You removed all scenes with Geralt and Ciri in the Brokilon forest and instead introduced Dara - a boring and useless character who replaced Geralt there!!<\n* >!Orgy and whores in Kaer Morhen (open for everyone apparently), Vesemir agreeing to poison Ciri, irritating Eskel being killed in the same episode. He was not a major character in the books but his description was opposite to the one you portrayed, why couldn't you create someone else then... Feels like somebody either didn't care and wasn't familiar with the books or specifically wanted to anger fans.!<\n* >!The whole Voleth Meir subplot was the worst part of the season, it constantly interrupted the main Geralt-Ciri interactions and felt artificially filled to give Yennefer and Fringilla(god knows why) more time (introducing real children eating 'Baba Yaga' for a short horror story where Geralt takes an order to kill it would be a great idea though). \\[Something I'd like to add: I agree about the potential of the voleth meir subplot but it had too much runtime and was underwhelming at best. They'd better spend that time with Geralt-Ciri-Yennefer/Dijkstra-Philippa/Vilgefortz&mages... In the books Philippa had way more impact on the story (contrary to the Fringilla) and here she basically appears only at the end.\\] !<\n   * >!Why did you have to take Yennefer's powers for the entire season? There could have been a cool magical duel with Rience, bonding with Ciri and Yennefer training her.

        "body": "Edit: Spoilers from both season 2 and the book \" blood of elves\"\n\n\nI think you guys are going too hard on the series.\nTbh I believe the witcher has the potential to be a masterpiece of an adaptation but the show is still not there, which is sad. But if you accept the fact that it's not on that level yet, you can enjoy it. \n\nI'll start with the changes they made in the plot. I love the books and I wish the adaptation was faithful to the books. That's the reason I was pissed at what they did to SoD. The story was so good specially brokilon which they totally butchered. But let's be honest here. BoE is not like that. The book itself was a good read but a good read doesn't necessarily make for a good TV adaptation. BoE is mostly about ciri training. The story is slow and not so many interesting fights and stuff happens and it's still interesting when you read the book but tv adaptation needs a lot more excitement. If they had been completely faithful to the books  there would've been a good chance it ended up a very boring watch. Specially for whoever hasn't read the books. I mean, imagine episodes 2 to 5 being solely about ciri's training like in the books. She already got enough scenes she doesn't need more.\n\nFor example, if they hadn't included that fight with eskel and his death at the end of episode 2, it would've been boring. I don't like that they killed eskel either but don't care that much tbh. Each episode needs it's ups and downs and the interesting endings with cliffhangers. Same thing with episode 3. A lot of people are mad about yen's storyline but that ending with her escaping with cahir was a very good ending. I wasn't sure about that whole thing either but for someone who hasn't read the books it creates many questions. Will yennefer join nilfgaard? That's what a TV adaptation needs. An interesting ending that creates questions. A lot of fights and entertaining confrontations to keep the audience interested. That wouldn't have happened if they had kept everything about ciri for most of the season, and suddenly adding a bunch of important characters (yen, jaskier, rience, Philippa. They're all in the second half of the book). Such changes cannot be accepted for season 3 and tToC because it already has interesting moments enough for a perfect adaptation. But for BoE, I'm personally fine with it.\n\nYen losing her magic was a good idea. If they were going to give her a storyline, at least it was a serious challenge.\nThe elves joining nilfgaard was crap but the ending with the child getting murdered was really good. It explains the racism very well and also explains where so much hatred comes from. We know the scoia'taels can be really ruthless and this justifies it perfectly. Then there's Rience. I really like him in the show. First time they started with the whole \"fire magic is banned\" shit I was mad. I still don't like it lol but it helped with rience's introduction. The kind of magic that most sorcerers can't do and requires a lot of talent is what rience does so regularly. Great villain introduction specially for whoever hasn't read the books. \n\nNow the changes I didn't like. The whole voleth mier was unnecessary. They could've just focused on geralt jaskier philippa shani storyline and a good fight with rience but they kept it for the next season. They tried to keep the most interesting shit for the next season.\nStill, the voleth mier and other new monsters were a good way to show ciri's importance and they introduced the wild hunt as well, which is good. Could've focused more on the main plot and less on voleth mier tho. Whores in kaer morhen was crap but as long as they were supposed to forget the whole thing including the directions (unless I misunderstood cause it was mentioned they weren't going to remember or something) it was alright. Although it was totally unnecessary lol. But I didn't like rience going to kaer morhen. It's supposed to be secret with few people know the directions. And very safe. Rience just makes a portal and shows up. Ciri leads a bunch of dwarves there!\nAlso,  melitele's temple is supposed to be so safe that geralt leaves ciri there. People can't just show up there and kill lol.\nI'm also not sure about francesca leading the rebellious elves. And they could just kill some other witcher instead of eskel and everybody could be happy lol.\n\nI had another problem with the show but I can't explain it. It's like it seems like some kind of fan made series some times lol. A bit cheesy and cringy every now and then. Annoyed me a lot but I ignored it and enjoed the show.\nAlso didn't like some of the slow motions and angle changes in some fights like the one against the four brothers.\n\nThe cast is perfect. Can't see anything wrong with it.\n\n\nIn general, it's not where it should be yet. It has the potential to be one of the greatest fantasy series ever. They're kind of wasting it. But they kept the most important moments of BoE in the series so they can still get on the right track. They haven't ruined anything irreversibly. It was better than season 1 and I think non book readers will enjoy it a lot more.",

Great performance, even though it was a short one!\n* Incredible  Fenn! That whole scene of Codringher and Fenn was so atmospheric. \"Very expansive, yes, very expensive\". And the cat, of course.\n* The Owl.\n* Alistair Parker as a Dock Worker (who btw voiced every single NPC in Novigrad and Cleaver in TW3) was great, especially because there was a hidden message in that character that made me crack up.\n* a man and a boy in the sewers ( with Yen and Cahir) were great too.\n\nThere are probably more but these stick out after the first watch.\n\nWho were your favs side characters?",

        "body": "There are book spoilers in this post for those who keep reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just binged all of Season 2 last night and I have come up with the following list of plot points that diminish the lore established in the books. While some changes can be seen as acceptable due to the nature of the stories and characters remaining the same, other's cannot be so easily dismissed.\n\n1. Eskel as unlikeable and turning into a Leshen and being killed off.\n2. Triss's visible burn scars (In Blood of Elves we learn that the physical scars were completely healed while the mental scars remain, hence multiple mentions of \"never again wearing a plunging neckline). This is actually a matter of debate in general among the fandom from my understanding concerning her scars in other media as well\n3. Witchers from Elder Blood. It is stated in the books that the chemical and magical method of making Witchers were both lost and unknown to Vesemir.\n4. Elder Blood growing specific flowers is just not a thing, maybe they adapted it from the Roses of Shaerrawedd, but that would be completely botching it as those flowers don't spring up from blood, much less Elder Blood.\n5. Yennefer's magic being taken. I get that the cost of using fire magic can sometimes lead to the loss of conjuring magic, as happened with Ciri in Time of Contempt. But this doesnt't matter as Yen gets her magic back by the end of the season and still burns Rience's face while saving Jaskier without it. However, I do understand how others could have more of an issue with it.\n6. Monoliths. Just in general never a thing. Also lead to a reveal of Ciri's inter-dimensional abilities far too early.\n7. Elves in Cintra instead of Dol Blathanna, could be potentially corrected if they relocate to the Blue Mountains in Season 4 but i have doubts.\n8. Francesca pregnant. initially i had an issue but when they killed off the baby they corrected the mistake. It gives more of a reason for elves to be killing humans as violently as they do in the books in my opinion. But the fact is that Francesca does not have the ability to bare children in the books to my understanding.\n9. Putting Fringilla in charge of Cintra instead of having Menno Coehoorn govern, this still could be corrected tho.\n10. Rience attacking Kaer Morhen. Not really anything else to say about this, just straight up doesn't occur.\n11. Istredd visiting Codringher and Fenn instead of Geralt. This can be corrected as well by just having Geralt himself visit them at some point before Schiruu kills them.\n12. Tissaia and Vilgefortz. Again not a thing and didn't serve a purpose to me, except to maybe justify her eventual suicide more? Still unsure of it though.\n13. Deathless mother. In general a fabrication because the producers believed that Blood of Elves was hard to adapt and needed a big bad. But then the scene of the Wild Hunt in physical form instead of Yennefer dispelling spectres of them chasing Ciri didn't quite occur either.\n\nA final note: I realize that the producers are trying to expand on the dynamic of certain characters because of their raised status, specifically Yennefer. Yes Yennefer is an important character and arguably one of the most important side characters in the books. But quite frankly, the amount of attention alotted to Ciri's story, Geralt's story, and the political happenings of the Kingdom have more page space in the books then Yennefer does. I'd say the books, not including the short stories, divide Geralt's journey as 30% of the saga, Ciri's as 40%, Politics as 20%, and Yennefer as 10%. That 10% is being generous for me, having just binged all the books over the course of 1 month the main characters to me are clearly only Geralt and Ciri. With this in mind there are a lot of blank spaces that need to be filled regarding Yennefer throughout varying points of the books so I am not surprised the show needs to embellish to cover her raised status. The thing is though they can embellish and add onto the lore like how the games do, instead of changing things like they've done this season. If I've missed anything or gotten anything wrong feel free to discuss below as I'm sure a lot of us have mixed feelings about this season. Let me know what your opinions were, always happy to hear more views.",

Those who read the books and love them clearly don't like this season either but I would argue that it's not just to do with diverting from the source material. Season just isn't written very well. Here's my reasons.\n\n1. Wants to be game of thrones too much. By this I mean there's multiple characters teaming up for a few episodes, then separating, then joining up with a new character. For example Yennefer has has road trips with Fringilla, Cahir, Jaskier, Ciri, and  Geralt. One or two this season would have been okay but that many results in some kind of whiplash. I'm guessing the thought process behind it is to make the world seem complex with a wide array of interlocking characters, what it felt like to me was when you lose your friends on a night out in club and randomly end up linking up with one stranger after another before getting confused and stumbling to a kebab shop having barely spent ten minutes with your actual friends who you arrived with. Developing Yennefer with already established bonds like Tissaia and Geralt and focusing more on one core new one like Ciri would have been way more satisfying.\n2. I was just confused. Baba Yaga/Deathless Mother was an interesting plot line but I found it confusing, couldn't even tell you why she wanted to control Ciri and when characters came to conclusions about what her goal was or the monoliths I was left wondering how the hell they figured it out because I didn't have the slightest idea what they were talking about. It was predictable too that Yennefer would lure Ciri away and then have a change of heart. Partly the confusion was because I wasn't paying attention, but that's due to my third point...\n3. I was kinda bored. I was on the edge of my seat in the first season watching Yennefer's transformation from piglet to sorceress and the impending doom of Cintra, which we saw in the very first episode and then went back to see how it all unraveled. This season's build up in comparison felt lackluster and the characters didn't change or grow they just bumbled around the setting. Speaking of setting...\n4. I have literally no idea of the geography of this place. Like where is everywhere? How long does it take to get from A to B? Why is Aretuza now some kind of dungeon prison when it was a school before? Where did all the students go? Locations just became plot devices.\n5. The new characters left a lot to be desired. Deathless Mother was a little random. Francesca was bland.\n\nIt wasn't the worst season of T.V ever. It just didn't hold together for me as well as the first season. Doesn't seem to have a cohesive point or theme it's working towards.",

        "body": "Someone underlined how strange was, for >!Emhyr!<, to reveal that secret not just to the audience but to every person before him. That could seem quite stupid, theoretically...but I realized something looking back to S2.\n\nGeralt didn't meet Codringher and Fenn. More than that, he didn't talk with >!Istredd!< again after the latter acquired intel about Calanthe's lineage *and* consulted Cod and Fenn.\n\nNow, this means Geralt can't know about the reveal in the same way it happened in the books, unless: A. Istredd tells him the truth (admitting Istredd will deduce the secret) or give him the intel to deduce it; B. Geralt visits Cod and Fenn - like in the books -, and either is told the truth or guess the truth alone; C. >!Cahir!< tells him the truth when the Hansa is formed, giving him another reason to trust him.\n\nTo be fair, even the most inattentive members of the audience could have got the reveal without >!Emhyr!< saying it aloud...but this approach from the show gave to >!Fringilla!< and >!Cahir!< good reasons to act on their own (Lodge and Hansa), gave Istredd something to do *and* supplied the elves with very needed intel about Ciri (just the part about the lineage, for now). Geralt can still gather intel the same way he did in the books, or doing so through scenes with more relevant characters. The >!Emhyr!< \"behavior\" is less strange than it seems, if we accept the idea most of the people in that hall A. didn't know *who* he was talking about or B. were loyal anyway, so they would keep their mouth shut.\n\nI also think the >!\"having a son with Ciri\"!<goal will be avoided in the show, because with the secret more widely known would be quite stupid on >!Emhyr's!<part to proceed the way he wanted in the books.\n\nIn short, it was a way for the show to offer the audience more intel than Geralt possessed at the moment, creating a bit of suspense about *when* and *how* he is going to know the truth and opening new opportunities for the Cahir and Frinilla's subplots.\n\nFinally, let's not forget that, by logic, Geralt knew or at least suspected even before Thanedd about the >!Emhyr-is-Duny!< secret but he never told Ciri or Yennefer...To be fair, Sapkowski probably hadn't decided yet about Geralt *guessing* the truth (albeit the twist in itself was hinted since \"BoE\") nor it is 100% sure Geralt had guessed the secret before the coup...but if >!Cahir!< will be the one to spill the beans to him, that problem/plothole will be avoided.",

        "body": "I can't sleep so I'm writing out my thoughts for what I wish the show did with season 2.  Obviously some things here aren't perfect, some things would need to be added or removed, but this is ultimately what my take on what a season of television based on The Blood of Elves would look like.\n\n**Episode 1**\n\nKeep it as is, I thought it was a good way to start the season and fill in the gap of travel between locations(something the show forgot after this episode, everyone seemingly gets to their destination within 30 minutes in the show)\n\n**Episode 2**\n\nIntroduce Kaer Morhen and the Witchers there, begin training Ciri.  We can have a Leshen plot where two or three of the Witchers take Ciri into the woods to demonstrate how they track and go after certain monsters.  \n\nYen can have a minor roll here to fill in the viewer as for how she is holding up after the battle at the end of season 1.\n\nEpisode ends with Ciri reciting words while being possessed as it was done in the book.\n\n**Episode 3**\n\nTriss goes to Kaer Morhen, she gets pissed off at the way the Witchers have been treating Ciri.  She tries to better learn as for what is going on with Ciri, maybe tries some basic magic training.\n\nYen can have a larger roll, fill in the gap before she finds Jaskier being interrogated. \n\nJaskier is introduced back into the fray similarly how it is in the show currently(sings a song, gets kidnapped by Rience)\n\nEpisode ends with Triss losing control over Ciri telling Geralt they need help.\n\n**Episode 4**\n\nEpisode opens with Jaskier being interrogated, Yen breaks him out, they fight with Rience, but escape, she discusses with Jaskier what that was all about.\n\nCiri, Geralt and Triss head off to Mellitele and meet up with Yarpen, they begin on a trip while having conversations building each of the characters up.\n\nEpisode ends with the Scoia'tael attacking Geralt and their group on the road.  Big battle sequence here.  Triss can play a roll, then she gets sick due to her using too much magic or something... See we *can* change the books a bit!\n\n**Episode 5**\n\nOpens with Ciri running off and being lost in the woods, Geralt finds her at Shaerrawedd, they have a heart to heart about elves, the politics of the world, Ciri and her families place in all of it, etc... Ultimately though, this can be used as a catalyst to start introducing the larger politics of the world to the television viewer.\n\nNext scene can be introducing Dijkstra and we can have some scheming with word on the elves teaming up with Nilfgaard.\n\nCiri learning from Nenneke and some other details with the school should be good character building and world building.  Her learning more details of the war, as presented in the books, is a perfect way to teach both her and the viewer about the current war and battles and different powers, etc...\n\nYen finds out where Geralt took Ciri and leaves Jaskier to go to Mellitele.  Maybe she reads the letter from Geralt.\n\n**Episode 6**\n\nYen arrives at Mellitele, has a conversation with Geralt about Ciri and how the school they're at just isn't enough.\n\nYen trains Ciri.  This should be pretty in depth training, with a lot of bonding between the characters.\n\nThis should be an episode where the three main characters should bond as much as possible, not get into a cheap fight with Rience.\n\nSpeaking of Rience, maybe show him listening to his boss through a portal, so we don't know who his boss is, but we get some more information with him and what he is up to.\n\n**Episode 7**\n\nDelve more into the politics, the scheming of what to do with Ciri, where Yen is, all the shit that happens that affects the main characters but happens behind their backs.\n\nGeralt tells Yen and Ciri he needs to go track down Rience, yen and Ciri leave for Thanedd.\n\nWe can create some more filler here, something interesting and lore friendly would be Geralt meeting Shani.\n\n**Episode 8**\n\nGeralt, Shani and Jaskier investigate Rience.  \n\nThey go to Codringher and Fenn.  \n\nEventually they find and meet Philippa.\n\nMeanwhile Yen and Ciri have more mother daughter building, maybe come into some conflict on their travels that strengthens their bond.  Ultimately this should have Yen and Ciri leaving off the season where Yen was too hard on her a few episodes prior, but having a great relationship in this episode.\n\nSeason ends with Geralt and his crew finding Rience, and culminating with the fight between Geralt, Rience and Phillipa.  Magic heavy fight sequence, Rience barely gets away with the help from Philippa and Geralt has his face slashed open bleeding in the middle of the street.\n\nRoll season ending credits.",

That means you are not feeling evilness, but it can make you feel expectant if you are near your goal.\n\nI can connect with most characters. Either I root for them or hate them because they are believable. That is what \"hit me in the stomach\" from season1. But not so with the mage. It just feels cheap. Adding an evil person was supposed to make it more exciting. Instead, I find it boring. It lacks the depth I grew to love with books/game/season1.",

I mean we saw her in complete manic coming out from the trance/dream and then just casually went back to her normal self and fought Rience afterwards.

She says things as they are in her life. Yen wasn’t ashamed in being vulnerable in her own way and always found a new purpose (as stated by her in episode 4 with Jaskier). However, the second half of the season begged her down to a begging sorceress, for some reason sacrificing an innocent child, what she was longing for for presumably decades depending on the timeline of the first season between episodes 5 and 6, to get back her magic. She also loses her charm and overall charisma which is a bummer😕",

        "title": "Summary and theory explaining Elder Blood (Hen Ichaer). SPOILERS.",
        "body": "Fair spoiler warning: Hen Ichaer is a major plot point in the books, and it is connected to the back story, the main storyline, the main characters. This post is focused on the topic of Elder Blood, but it really is tied to multiple other elements. I won't be putting any specific spoilers warnings in this post and i won't be putting any spoiler tags. Consider this whole post a major spoiler for the books, partially also for the games, and an invitation to consider where the show is being taken with regards to Hen Ichaer as the central lore of the Continent.\n\nSpoilers from this point on.\n\n.\n\nKeep in mind that even if you decide to read all this and learn about Elder Blood without having read the books, you shouldn't consider all the books spoiled and not worth reading anymore. You most likely already know some of the main plot twists of the books just by playing the games and/or watching the show (Emhyr being Ciri's father being a big one). Still - the books offer more than just the 'main plot points' - the characters and their relations, the locations, the lore and all the detail are still worth reading through. A lot of people re-read the books with a particular interest in mind: 'this time i will read from the perspective of Kovir and Poviss, and the economy of the Continent', 'this time i will read focused on the elder lore and try to pick up details'. Go. Read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post will be long. The topic is too complex for me to provide a tl;dr - someone else is welcome to do so in the comments.\n\n.\n\nElder Blood is the main reason for most of primary conflicts - the end-goal of Emhyr, Vilgefortz, the Wild Hunt, and others. It ties together Ithlinne's Prophecy, Nilfgaard, Cintra, and the Wild Hunt. Its narrative is fueled by confusion around Falka, elven curses, and the Curse of the Black Sun (Renfri was said to have 'bad blood' from that particular curse, and Stregobor was said to be among mages hunting the 'cursed children').\n\nIt is a central element of the lore of the whole Continent, and a scheme that was set in motion centuries before the time of Geralt and Ciri.\n\nBut what is it all about, actually? Why Ciri? What does the Elder Blood do and where does it come from? What is its point?\n\n.\n\nI will start with providing a translation of a post from Wieża Błaznów, an old messaging board focused on Sapkowski's books. Back in July 2014, user known as Torp published a great summary along with some valid extended speculation. Everything between the next two dots comes from Torp, i'm only bringing it to you. Afterwards, i'll add my own commentary to Torp's version, expand on some details, and touch on how Elder Blood was depicted in games and the show. If you feel it doesn't make sense, or seems too far-fetched or weird, it shows how different the books are, and how different the books' focus is. One thing to keep in mind is that while the Witcher series is medievalesque in aesthetic and appearance, some knowledge of genetics, mutations, blood strains, and other 'advanced' science is already incorporated into the world. \n\n.\n\nSource: [http://www.wiezablaznow.pl/viewtopic.php?p=604649&sid=fe0393adcf7a502e40189e4ec7715986](http://www.wiezablaznow.pl/viewtopic.php?p=604649&sid=fe0393adcf7a502e40189e4ec7715986)\n\nTranslated with [deepl.com](https://deepl.com), manually corrected where deepl failed. \\[Some intrusions in square brackets.\\]\n\n.\n\n\\[Torp\\]\n\nThe origin and history of the genetic material called Hen Ichaer, the Elder Blood, is an important part of the storyline of the Witcher series, connecting the history of elves, humans and...unicorns.\n\nBefore the cataclysmic event known as the Conjunction of Spheres, elves could travel freely between several different worlds, and that's when they came to the Continent. The Conjunction made it possible to move freely not only between their previous worlds, but also opened the access to new worlds, and not only for elves. This was when humans and monsters, including the ancestors of the vampire Regis, appeared on the Continent. The problem for the elves was that once the Conjunction ceased, travel between worlds suddenly became impossible. The gates were closed, the elves could not travel even between the few worlds they had before the Conjunction. Some of them stayed on the Continent as Aen Seidhe, the People of the Hills, while the rest moved to another universe becoming Aen Elle, the People of the Alders, ruled by Auberon Muircetach.\n\nThe only beings for whom the closed Ard Gaeth, Gate of the Worlds, presented no problem were the unicorns. The elves knew this and used these animals to create the Elder Blood gene. This gene, when refined, would allow the Chosen One to open the Gate...\n\n1. There was an Avallac'h's laboratory in Tir ná Lia, where the genetic material was probably taken from the unicorns. It was then \"implanted\" into selected Aen Elle. It is known that besides Avallac'h this gene was possessed by Auberon Muircetach, Shiadhal and Eredin Bréacc Glas, and probably also Dearg Ruadhri, the Red Riders. Its later refinement may have occurred naturally. In Lara Dorren, the genetic material inherited from her parents mutated. Combined with magical abilities, this enabled her to travel freely between worlds after Conjunction. Both Avallac'h and Eredin (and his Red Riders) were limited in this regard. Avallac'h could only travel to Tir ná Béa Arainne located on the Continent beneath Mount Gorgon, Eredin and his riders wandered the Spiral like ghosts \\[starting the stories of Wild Hunt\\].\n\nAvallac'h loved Lara and it was probably in the original plans that he was to become the father of her child. They were both elven wizards of the Aen Saeyheme, the Knowers. It was believed that the descendant of this child would already possess the abilities to open the Gates of the Worlds. However, Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal thwarted all Aen Elle plans by giving herself to a human, the wizard Cregennan of Lod.\n\n2. The Queen of Redania, Cerro took in Lara's daughter, Riannon, after Lara Dorren's death. According to legend, Cerro took care of Lara's child because she was horrified by the curse the elf cast on her when she refused to help her and banished her to the frost.\n\n3. Before marrying Cerro, Vridank, King of Redania, left his first wife, a Kovir noblewoman, whom he sent back to Kovir with their year-old daughter, Falka.\n\n4. Falka, when she grew up, fomented an uprising for her rightful throne. The uprising escalated into a massive war, during which Vridank and Cerro were murdered.\n\nThe pregnant Riannon, later wife of Goidemar, King of Temeria, was captured by Falka's rebels and imprisoned in Houtborg Castle. Falka also became pregnant and gave birth to a child at the exact same time as Riannon, still imprisoned in Houtborg, gave birth to twins. On Falka's orders, her child was added to Riannon's infants. Upon her release, Riannon was insane, and when she was finally cured of her insanity, she was unable to determine which of the three children was Falka's.\n\nAccording to the prophecy of the elven bard Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien (The Prophecy of Ithlinne, Aen Ithilinnespeath), a Destroyer of Worlds \\[The Destroyer\\] was to be born in unspecified future, who would destroy the existing world. On its ruins a new one was to rise, reborn from the Elder Blood, from Hen Ichaer. After the rebellion was crushed and Falka burned at the stake, the text of the Prophecy of Ithlinne began to be linked to her person. The result was a prophecy that Falka's blood would give birth to an avenger who would destroy the world. Added to the prophecy was the legend of the curse cast by Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal. This created the myth of the defiled, tainted, cursed blood, the blood of the elves, which was mistakenly identified with the myth of the Elder Blood, Hen Ichaer.\n\nThe problem is that although Falka inherited the blood of Aen Seidhe from her mother, a Kovirian noblewoman and half elf, in no way could Lara's curse include her, as it was cast upon Cerro, the second wife of King Vridank of Redania. Also, Falka's biological child was Adela, who died at the age of seventeen from the plague while helping sick children. However, the lack of certainty as to which of the Houtborg triplets was Falka's bastard child gave rise to suspicions (after Adela and Amavet died at a young age) that Fiona, Ciri's great-great-granddaughter, was her \\[Falka's\\] daughter.\n\n5. The Elder Blood gene can only be passed on continuously through the female line. If the carrier is male, the gene disappears in the second, at the most, third generation.\n\nKing Dagorad of Cintra possessed the nearly extinct latent Lara Dorren gene. His wife, Adalia called Fairy, Duchess of Maribor also possessed an already tenuous activator. In the daughter of these both, Calanthe, the 'Lara gene' \\[the Elder Blood - the mutated unicorn gene\\] was revived. Through the female line of the Cynthrine dynasty, this gene has been further \"enhanced\".\n\n\\[See [https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Elder\\_Blood#Genealogy](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Elder_Blood#Genealogy) at this point for reference.\\]\n\n\\[Adela was Falka's biological daughter.\\]\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nBefore the Conjunction and during the Conjunction of the Spheres, the Gate was open, when the Conjunction ended the Gate was closed. Auberon's elves crossed over to the World of Alders on their own before the Conjunction ended or after it ended with the help of unicorns.\n\nUnicorns, let alone elves NEVER opened/closed the Gate themselves. Elves did not have such a power, while unicorns did not need it because the closed Gate was not a problem for them to travel between worlds. The unicorns helped the elves to open the Gate (opening it required cooperation of elves and unicorns), but when they realized how elves were using it, unicorns refused to cooperate:\n\n\\[In italics are citations from books, but translated with deepl - not taken from the translated books.\\]\n\n*But Fox and Sparrowhawk cannot gain power over Ard Gaeth, the Gate of the Worlds. Once they have gained. Once they have lost.*\n\nThe end of this cooperation was likely bloody as evidenced by Avallac'h's reaction and Eredin's words:\n\n*The song of Avallac'h and the elves broke off. Ciri saw the sage surreptitiously rub the sweat from his brow. Out of the corner of her eye, the elf looked at her, realizing she had seen.*\n\n*'Not everything here is as pretty as it looks,' he said dryly. - 'Not everything.'*\n\n*'Are you afraid of unicorns? After all, they are wise and friendly.' \\[Ciri.\\]*\n\n*He did not answer.*\n\n*'I've heard - she didn't give up - that elves and unicorns love each other.'*\n\n*He turned his head away.*\n\n*'So assume,' he said coldly, 'that what you saw was a lovers' quarrel.'*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*'Even if by some miracle you were to break through the Barrier,' Eredin kept his eyes on her, 'know that it would mean your doom. This world only looks pretty. But it brings death, especially to the unfamiliar. Even magic cannot heal a wound from a unicorn's horn.'*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nVilgefortz's lab = Avallac'h's lab\n\n*'I don't come to you for love! - she \\[Ciri\\] barked furiously. - I'm being hogtied and blackmailed, you know it! But I am accepting, I am doing this for... -'*\n\n*'For who? - he \\[Eredin\\] interrupted passionately, not at all elfishly. - For me? For the Aen Seidhe trapped in your world? You stupid girl! You do this for yourself, you come here for yourself and you try in vain to give yourself away. Because this is your only hope, your only plank of life. And I'll tell you one more thing: pray, fervently pray to your human idols, idols or totems. Because either it will be me, or it will be Avallac'h and his lab. Believe me, you wouldn't want to end up in a lab and get acquainted with the alternative.'*\n\nVilgefortz wanted to \"implant\" himself (transfer using his lab equipment) Ciri's gene so he could travel between worlds.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\[All citations below are also translated with deepl.\\]\n\nIt seems that my theory as to the origin of the Elder Blood gene is supported by another thing that can be seen when we look at the character of Ciri and the unicorn through the lens of Arthurian myth. I'm thinking here mainly of the narrative line of that legend, connected with the search for the Grail, which was most influenced by Christianity, becoming a peculiar product of that culture in the Middle Ages. As Katarzyna Łęk proves in her work 'The Arthurian Myth in the cycle of works about the witcher Geralt by A. Sapkowski', \"the virtual presence of the Grail in the story is a very important element. Sapkowski, \"the virtual presence of the Arthurian myth, especially its 'grail branch', in the Witcher series is a fact. Revealing - through figurative interpretation - the features of the characters and artifacts of the protagonists of A. Sapkowski's cycle, unveiled the reality of reference to the Grail legend as the structural and semantic core of the cycle.\" Analyzing the character of Ciri, Łęk shows that she is the main element linking the Witcher books with the myth of the quest for the Holy Grail. Developing the thesis of N. Lemann from the article entitled 'Arthurian Literature in the Works of Andrzej Sapkowski, or All Roads Lead to Camelot' proves that Ciri is the Grail of the Witcher world.\n\nEssential to my theory is the literal perception of Ciri as the Grail, or cup, from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper and into which Joseph of Arimathea collected the blood (from the pierced side) of the crucified Christ (after Robert de Boron). As Łęk writes: \"This interpretation was connected with one of the etymologies (admittedly erroneous, but constituted by tradition) of the word 'Grail', explaining it as coming from the expression 'royal blood'. This is the etymology referred to by A. Sapkowski refers to it when creating the character of the Cintrian girl, who is just such a \"vessel\" of the most genuine royal blood (KE 208, CHO 24\\*). \\[...\\] Firstly, Ciri is the Grail as the heir to the royal crown of her grandmother Calanthe, the Lioness of Cintra. Second, as one in whose veins flows Hen Ichaer, the sacred Elder Blood, the Blood of the Elves (cf. PJ 339).\" Sapkowski, using a heavily Christianized version of the Grail legend, transforms it into the legend of Ciri, transforms the Christian sacrum into the figure of a girl with mousy-gray hair. I wonder if AS has not also transferred the central figure of Christianity to the world of the Witcher and transformed it, this time in accordance with its medieval symbolism. I mean, of course, Jesus, who in Christian art was symbolically represented, among other things, as a unicorn. If we look at the unicorns in Sapkowski's universe (in particular the character of Ihuarraquax) as a collective Christ figure, a \"divine\" race of beings endowed with extraordinary Power, then my theory of the origins of the Elder Blood gene receives some support in the area that most strongly inspired AS in his work.\n\nIt also sheds new interpretive light on two passages in the Witcher cycle. The first is the sojourn of Ciri the Grail and the unicorn Christ in the desert of Korath. A parallel can be seen here with the temptation of Jesus in the desert described in the New Testament. In Korath, Ciri renounces the power perceived as a tool that sows death and chaos, serving only to gain power. Christ does the same by rejecting the promptings of the devil. \"In the desert you renounced juggling. The power that is in your blood you cannot renounce. You still have it. We will teach you how to use it. For we have always had it.\" These words are addressed to Ciri by the unicorns in the final volume of the series.\n\nIt seems that the power that Zireael possesses is to some extent a reflection of the Power of Jesus, which according to Catholic mysticism is revealed in the Eucharist. The Blessed Sacrament for Catholics is not mere juggling hocus-pocus magic (the phrase is a parody of the words of consecration: Hoc est enim corpus meum \\[For this is my body\\]). It is the center of Catholic life, where miracle, mystery, hope are found. Before the advent of Enlightenment skepticism, the Eucharist was considered the highest form of Magic, and the Catholic world was saturated with its mysticism, which was as real to the societies of the time as Magic was to the inhabitants of Witcherland.\n\nThe second passage from the Witcher books, the scene in which Ciri, with the help of the unicorn Ihuarraquax, uses the Power to heal the mortally wounded Geralt, should be seen, I think, from this perspective. In both cases, the essence of the Power, the overriding purpose of its use is to help, to protect.\n\n\\[/Torp\\]\n\n.\n\nThat was something.\n\nSapkowski did draw inspiration and reference from multiple sources, and Arthurian myths was a big one. Ciri as the Grail (understood as the 'sang real' - the bloodline - a theory you may be familiar with) is a strong theory. There are multiple other very obvious references to the Arthurian myth (in some version).\n\nThe Korath desert scene also does parallel Jesus, but i find this a more loose connotation. I think that Torp's suggestion of viewing unicorns as a 'Christ figure' is theory-crafting gone *too* far; still an interesting take, but the latter Torp's extrapolation into Eucharist and more Christ parallels based on just the Korath scene is... too much in my opinion.\n\n. \n\nLet's get back to the in-universe elements. \n\nEveryone wanted Ciri for her blood - but not *literally*. Elder Blood shouldn't be understood as having to do much with 'blood' as actual substance. It was about her bloodline - ancestry and potential children, as well as her unique genes allowing for travel between worlds. \n\nContrary to what the show depicted, Elder Blood (or even elven blood) was not used to create witchers, or for any other magical / mutagenic practices. Elder Blood is not the same as just any 'elven blood' either, or 'blood of the elves'. Even if you disregard the whole unicorn involvement and disagree with their genes being used to create Elder Blood, we know it's a very particular, special bloodline of the elves, whether engineered or occured naturally. The Wild Hunt (Red Riders of Eredin) want to capture Ciri for it.\n\nAnother thing that the show changed, really being just tied to their decision to go with 'treat blood literally' as opposed to the figurative way from the books is Feainnewedd - the flower grows only where 'Elder Blood was spilled'. It is said to only grow in Dol Blathanna and the place where Lara died. 'Spilling of Elder Blood' should not be read literally, as in blood contacting the earth; it's a general remark about death of those carrying the unique gene.\n\nI hope this is just a way to build up the premise, and the show is not going to change it all to literal blood used for forbidden magic by power-hungry sorcerers and demons.\n\n.\n\nIthlinne's Prophecy speaks of Tedd Deireadh, the End Times. The world will fall under ice, the White Frost and White Light. The world will be destroyed but ultimately reborn - it will be reborn from Hen Ichaer, the Elder Blood. The first sign of Tedd Deireadh coming was supposed to be the flowing blood of the elves (hence the book title! - it's not about Ciri) - seen as pogroms and murders of elves, as well as the death of elven youth in Scoia'tael. The time of madness and time of contempt is soon to follow (Time of Contempt being the name of the second book).\n\nElder Blood ties into it on two layers. \n\nFirst, it's said the world will be reborn of the Elder Blood. This has nothing to do with Elder Blood originally being genetically engineered to reopen the Gate, yet another facet for importance of Elder Blood to the Continent. It was widely believed that the 'seed that reborns the world' was meant to be Ciri's son, not Ciri herself. This is the reason Emhyr wanted to find her and marry her - so that their son/gradson would rule the new world. Yes, that's Emhyr for you.\n\nSecond, there was still major confusion mixing up Falka, Falka's 'curse', rumours of bad spoiled elven blood, some voices about Curse of the Black Sun, the 'avenger that will be born' (all, in my opinion, unsubstantiated, self-fulfilling curses if any at all) - all of these stories and ideas got mixed with the actual Elder Blood (the mutated gene allowing for travel between worlds) - and with Ithlinne's Prophecy (whether it was true or not: if the world was going to die in White Frost and be reborn of Ciri's son). \n\nWitcher 3, the game, has to do with actual Tedd Deireadh, with the time of sword and axe, with time of contempt. It shows the White Frost and ties it with another Conjunction, then puts Ciri as the saviour of this story. It makes for a good narrative, but it mixes up a good bit too - like Eredin would know another Conjunction was coming, so why would he still need Ciri so obssessively at this point?\n\n.\n\nCiri was hunted to either have her unique powers extracted via obscure (and ultimately lethal) laboratory/magical ways, or to be impregnated (primarily by forceful methods) and have her son used - either to control the 'reborn world' or to use him and his power, be it to open the Gate or to give that power over to Vilgefortz. \n\nAfter Pavetta's death and Calanthe's demise, Ciri was the only known person of Elder Blood. This does not mean she was actually the only one, as another's family tree could form a circle (similar to Calanthe's parents) and reactivate the latent genes in a different daughter. This angle is explored in Witcher 1 (the game), where Alvin (and his future self) most likely has the Lara Dorren gene and is Elder Blood as well. For books, Ciri is the only one though, and so all the story, all the conflict, and all the eyes are on her.\n\n.\n\nWhile a truly focal point of the story, Elder Blood is only one of the detailed and nuanced elements from the books.

(I'm not looking for a discussion on the quality of the season or the changes made I'm just curious as to whether or not he's similar to his book counterparts.)",

But I am also a nosy fucker, so I really hope some of you with more knowledge and understanding can help me answer some questions I have burning in my very soul after watching season 2. Let’s do this: \n\n1. If Duny was Emhyr this whole freaking time, where the heck has he been Ciri’s whole life?\n\na. Why is he evil? \n\nb. Why did he order the murder of the elven baby? Isn’t that a really dumb thing to do politically or are the elves too weak to go for revenge?\n\n2. Is Pavetta alive too??\n\na. Speaking of Pavetta, why was she able to see Ciri in that vision Ciri and Triss were walking through? And why did she seem kinda evil in it? \n\n3. What exactly does Nilfgaard/Duni/Emhyr want with Ciri? Is it just a matter of the crown or is there something more sinister brewing?\n\n4. Why did Calanthe hate elves? \n\na. Like, is the hatred of elven kind just straight up racism or is there something else going on? \n\n5. Does ‘elder blood’ mean ‘elf blood’? \n\n6. In the end, Geralt told Yen that she is the only one who can teach Ciri. But wouldn’t Tissaia be an even better teacher considering she has more practice and is a whole Rectoress? \n\na. Speaking of Tissaia, why is she worried about Ciri? \n\n7. How did Yen get her Chaos back? \n\na. And what was the point of taking in Voleth Meir if they just chucked her into the portal? \n\n8. What’s up with the Wild Hunt? Are they supposed to come through via the broken monoliths that Ciri broke? But they are in another sphere, right? \n\nPlease be nice.",

When I saw Tissaia crying over Yennefer, I was already convinced that the runners either didn't read the books, or read but decided to throw them to the trash can. In books, Tissaia is the author of the words \"there is nothing more pathetic than a sorceress in tears\". She says it to Yennefer, who decides to live to these words and then says it to Ciri, who also decides so. This, and the whole character and behaviour of Tissaia, show explicitly that she bears these words in her very *soul*. Damn, when she commits a fucking *suicide*, she never sheds a tear, she is calm and pedantic, as always. (Not even gonna mention that she was the most powerful human character in the whole world and the show makes her look like a slightly above average sorceress) Tissaia was, in spite of not showing so much on screen, a great character that I loved. Seeing her so massacred right at the beginning of the show, I expected nothing good of it anymore.",

        "body": "SPOILERS!!\n\nI'm sorry if this is a bit rant-ish, but has any od scriptwriters read the books? Im not trying to hate, nor question the change of story, ok. They tried to ditch short stories into the main plot I respect that. Only gonna point out few things.\n\nI have seen 6 episodes so far and will finish tommorow, so I'm saying the impressions from these episodes.\n\nKaer mohren should be a gruesome lonely place. Instead they being whores and Eskel is a leshy apparently. When Geralt and Cíti came, the girl was terryfied, here She just sits Down and Has a good time.\n\nMages should be sketchy and hate TF out of each other instead they are supportive. And... They knew that Ciri was THE child since first or second book cuz they had knowledge about the bloodline since Falka. Plus they were divided because Nilfgaard tried to persuade them to their side (because they lost to them on sodden). Francesca was with them, at least they knew about her bcs She was in the capitol (or whatever those top 5-6 mages were called).\n\nYennefer should be arrogant and sharp, threatening and only interested in herself, lowkey evil, badass nevertheless. Untouchable character that Has respect of everyone from moment one. Instead she is caring and good? And kind of desperate? And Has a heated argument with Cahir? Like in terms of wit Yennefer is one of the premiere characters. \n\nDjikstra should be one fat ugly mofo instead he looks really good and is charming. Wyzimir was poisoned in the begining of the story, now he is... Well. Wyzimir.\n\nCiri was training blindfolded and did all sorts od acrobatic stunts. You know, for monsters and stuff. Not a slightly dangerous playground and a manequin. She was a likeable character. My favourite to say. I liked her bcs She had this subtle intuition inside of her that made her magical and appealing to me as reader. Dont know where writers are going with this but seems to me that they are portraying her as \"opressed by authority figures\". And that is sad to me, bcs Ciri was one of the best written characters. Her outbursts of foretelling random people's deaths like nothing and the same people dying short after. Chilling. When Triss first met her, She foretold even her and was clueless about it. It's these subtle things that writers missed that I loved about witcher and Ciri. In games IT was different, bcs Ciri was grown and in control od her powers, it didnt news such emphasis there. Here it does and is lacking.\n\nAnd to Geralt... in the books he was kind od an idiot. Likabke but idiot. Ciri was his redemption (both his and Yennefers). In the books he was well aware of situation bcs of his superior senses i.e. of elfs lurking in the woods on way to Nenneke. \n\nCahir being whatever he is... Instead of a weirdo creeper. \n\nNot speaking about Vilgefortz.\n\nThere were lots of WTF moments, like really nuts. Yennefer executing Cahir with an axe. Witchers making mutagens from Ciri and Vesemir trying to make her one? Damn. No one saying the most iconic lines. Rience showing up at Caer Mohren and no witcher hearing him with his superior senses (and Rience actually being OP instead of a coward?). Francesca in order to have a child of pure eleven blood (that means with a pure blooded elf) she has to go live amongst men? Nenneke telling Geralt to find what is missing in Ciri (in books Triss got scared of her powers and recommended her to Yennefer, who was came to the temple od Melitele in the first place). Bloody Istredd visits Codringer and Fenn? Cmon. \n\nOveral, after the 6th episode, I still have hope for the next season. The most Interesting parts of Blood of Elves may be on the big screen after all. Geralt goes to Oxenfurt to find out who hired Rience (but he already met him and has slain Micheline bros in ep6, and Istredd was at C&F so the whole exposition is dumped away I guess), meets with Jaskier, Shani, Filippa. Those are the Interesting parts of books. But... He had already met Yen so... We'll see, writers have thrown away a lot of good material (im sad that Triss didnt have diarhea and Geralt helping her Dump, and Yarpen Zigrin being with them, explaining stuff to Ciri...). \n\nSo, these are my takouts. Wadaya think?",

I’d assume Geralt would know what  Ehmyr looked like and would be able to say “oh shit, that’s Duny”. Same goes for Ciri and everyone in Cintra. Why is everyone on the continent following along with the story that Duny died at sea? Does he typically hide his identity or something?",

        "body": "So I really enjoyed Season 2, as I've said all over the place. On rewatch though, I realized I'm not so sure how I feel about Tissaia's romance subplot. I admit its relatively minor, but it feels off to me. Mostly because it seems to me that its meant to tie into >!Vilgefortz's betrayal. When his betrayal is revealed, I imagine it pushes Tissaia over into her suicide.!<\n\nNow I could be wrong on one major front, and that's assuming that Tissaia >!commits suicide!< and doesn't infact go out some other way. If she does though, it feels... wrong. The implication would be that >!her suicide is motivated more by a broken heart!< and that actually seems oddly reductive considering the broad arc of her character. In the books, >!her suicide!< is a function of the total sense of betrayal and seeing her world, and everything she's built, collapse. I'm just concerned that a romance with Vilgefortz will end up reducing her actions down to being motivated entirely by romance.\n\nIts a relatively minor moment, but I think it was a mistake. Tissaia and Vilgefortz would work much better if there was no romantic entanglement.",

        "body": "https://imgur.com/a/rYhMc21\n\nSo it seems like new kinds of monsters isn't the only thing that came through \"monoliths\" in Season 2. Turns out Littlefinger's teleportation device has slipped into the world of Witcher, right in to the hands of Geralt.\n\nHere (pic related) you can see the map of Northern Kingdoms. The red circle in the center is Ellander, where Nenneke's temple is located. This is from where both Geralt and Yen with Ciri set out in the start of episode 7 virtually at the same time.\n\nYen and Ciri (blue line) are instantly teleported (dashed line) to a hut, where Ciri lived with peasants after her escape from Cintra and where she meets Geralt. It is located in Sodden, on the left bank of Yaruga (big blue oval). From there they go straight to Cintra. OK, nothing seems wrong. Now let's get to Geralt.\n\nGeralt is in a **real big hurry**, so he (green line) goes to rescue Jaskier. Let's assume that he somehow knows exactly where to find him (why wouldn't he, right? Geralt haven't heard anything about Jaskier for several months). So he rescues Jaskier and then they go... *to Kaedwen... On foot...* 'Cause Geralt is in a **big hurry**, isn't he?\n\nEdit: turns out Geralt was teleported by Nenneke from the temple to Oxenfurt. Still doesn't make much difference.\n\nThere (somewhere inside big green oval) they meet Yarpen that runs convoys for King Henselt (*\"in the middle of east bloody nowhere\"* says Yarpen).Yarpen gives Geralt a horse, and... whole company goes with Geralt and Jaskier. Why? Well, because fuck Henselt, right? You are on a service of a king, and by the looks of it you are on a mission, but sure, let's go arcoss two kindoms, fuck knows where, the king can wait!\n\nThen they they cross river Pontar, going through Temeria from north to south, then Brugge, they cross Yaruga river and going straight to Cintra. Right. One man on a horse, one on foot and five dwarves on a cart.\n\nSo Geralt travelled with an average of a normal walking speed, distance roughly **10 times** of a distance Yen and Ciri covered mostly galloping or trotting.\n\nAnd of course, **OF COURSE** they made it to Cintra just in time for Geralt to save Ciri from Nilfgaardians!\n\nNow this is what you call a thoughtful and meaningful writing, isn't it?",

See how close they are to Cintra now?\n\nSo, is there anyone that could explain how the hell Geralt was able to catch up to them near Cintra when ha had whole country(ies) to travel, actual border with Nilfgaard and Yaruga river (which should be hard to cross) on the way, with Jaskier on foot and some dwarves on that old wagon?\n\nAnd how they were able to go back to Kaer Morhen just like that, when this is a journey that would take months (including crossing mountains, Yaruga river, and border with Nilfgaard again) - just see where is Kaer Morhen on the map. It would take MONTHS, and even if we assume that it took months then it seems like all the rest of plotlines have been on <pause> that whole time.\n\nReally, I understand why there were changes made to Blood of Elves plot, but when you published official map, at least take a look on it when you're writing your scripts, cause what was shown in episodes 7-8 makes no sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(NEXT SEASONS/BOOK SPOILERS)\n\n^(What is funny, is the fact, that in next seasons they will be travelling other way around (if the plot of \"Baptims of fire\" will be adapted, and suddenly it will be very difficult task to accomplish :P))",

And never really give her any encouragement or a warm, Michael she’s gonna keep getting tired and then I watch How are you doing how are around I wouldn’t be surprised if\nShe ended up leaving him. I mean I don’t even understand he doesn’t give her a weapon she’s been training and he doesn’t even give her a sword while they’re traveling to #MIN that means she doesn’t really truster I know",

The dialogue especially is straight up fan fiction and belongs in an angsty show about teenagers. \n\n* Jaskier is a self insert there to tell you that you're wrong if you dislike the show. It's insultingly bad. \n\n* The plot isn't very good either and its all over the place with characters constantly making awful decisions to progress the barely comprehensive plot points. No one acts as an adult or has a unique inner voice to make character specific decisions. \n\n* Some actions scenes are so poorly choreographed and shot that it looks like a b movie from early 2000s. \n\n\nSuch beautiful source material wasted on something people are going to watch on their phones in the background and forget about it the next day.",

That whole scene was just awful to watch.\n\nAlso what the fuck have they done to vesimer?? His character was going to turn ciri and then kill her??  Wtf",

        "title": "My thoughts on The Witcher Season 2 (No Spoilers)",
        "body": "I disliked season 1. I thought the writing and the \"look\" of the show was not that good. It felt like a generic TV fantasy show (think Merlin, Once Upon a Time), but with gore, violence, & nudity. However, I gave it the benefit of the doubt, thinking that the showrunners might have had an uphill battle trying to adapt the books and that they were just testing the waters & laying foundations. Overall, I rated it a 4/10. After watching season 2, I feel like not much has improved. \n\nFull disclosure: I have not read the books. I have no intention of reading them until Netflix's The Witcher has run its course. First of all, I don't like reading, second-- I can't get the books in a complete collection in my country, third--I don't want to get all \"BUT THE HOLY SCRIPTURES SAID-\". If I experienced something superior, then it's difficult for me to tone down my expectations, thus affecting my judgement of the show. Nevertheless, I am familiar with all major events and characters in these novels because of the internet. Now back to the discussion.\n\n# The Good\n\nI think they finally found their groove. Before this, they were trying their best to pursue their own storyline while staying as true to the books as possible. But in season 2, I think they gave up on that and clearly admitted that they want to do their own thing. I can respect this decision. It's best to admit to wanting to do your own thing rather than juggle two objectives and failing at both. This decision provides clear focus and better sense of direction, therefore making it easier for them to plan ahead accordingly. Due to this newfound focus, I think the overall story of season 2 is better than season 1. Additionally, SOME of the new plotlines are interesting. Whether the showrunners successfully follow up on this, remains to be seen.\n\nGeralt's characterization is much closer to what I expected him to be. As usual, Henry Cavill did a great job at playing the character and remains the primary reason why I watch this series to begin with. I imagine that his efforts to push for accuracy where it's possible has paid off. Other standout characters of season 2 are Ciri, Tissaia, and Dijkstra. Their respective actors did a great job of portraying them (MyAnna Buring continues to be stellar in season 2).\n\nThe armor/ outfit designs for characters in season 2 has vastly improved. \n\nThe sword fights retain the intensity of season 1's.\n\n# The Not So Good\n\nI think this part has been discussed extensively in sub, so I'll keep it short. \n\nI think that almost every major character (and events) that were focused on in this season -- with the exception of Geralt, Ciri, Tissaia, and Dijkstra-- were assassinated. Their backstories, their dialogue, relationships, and their motivations all seem so hollow, and in some cases, the complete opposite to they were like in the books. The actors did the best they could with the script they were given, and it shows. Yennefer in particular felt like a huge waste. Nothing about her in this series is interesting. Her problems seem really subpar compared the things other characters are going through so it's difficult to root for her. I think Anya Chalotra is a good actress, but she can't own the character because Yen's characterization is too generic. Almost any actress can play her. The writers did her dirty. \n\nAdd all of this to the sudden fast travels and quick conflict resolutions, it seems to me that The Witcher season 2 has taken quite a bit of  inspiration from the later seasons of Game of Thrones.\n\nOverall, I'm giving season 2 a rating of 5/10. It doesn't escape the negatives of season one except for doubling down on a singular focus, which is admitting the show exists as its own canon. I'm still sticking with this series, because I love the Witcher IP and adore Henry's love for it as well. But much like Game of Thrones, my interest in future Netflix Witcher content has waned drastically. The Witcher: Blood Origin trailer looked good, but I am not at all excited for it. IMO, even the recent Nightmare of The Wolf wasn't that good as it suffered from generic writing.\n\nWhen it comes to Netflix adaptations, you either get something magical like Arcane, or you get something like The Witcher.",

        "title": "[No book spoilers] In defense of the adaptation of the second season",
        "body": "I'll avoid any spoilers for the upcoming seasons/books in this thread, so non-book readers don't have to worry. There are spoilers for season 2.\n\nI finished watching season 2 yesterday and recently read the first four books and started with the fifth. As I've now read the Blood of the Elves myself, I was surprised to find so many book readers here so strongly disliked the latest season. I actually found it to be a good but sometimes flawed television adaptation with strong setup for upcoming events.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I also disliked the portrayal of the witchers at Kaer Morhen. The whole party at Kaer Morhen, Eskel being unceremoniously getting killed off, Vesemir's characterization and him easily being beaten by Rience, Rience even finding Kaer Morhen, and witchers under the effect of elixers being bested by some flying shards and two monsters could and should have been handled much better. The \"fast travelling\" was not great either as it removed a sense of scale, but I understand why they did it to move the plot forward. They could do a better job to indicate the passing of time between key scenes and slow down the pacing a bit.\n\nThat being said, I don't really see how a direct adaptation Blood of the Elves could have worked on television, especially for the general audience. Unlike Time of Contempt and the short stories, it's a very heavily character driven book instead of being event or action driven. Simply said, not much happens in the book besides the readers really learning about the characters. This is not a bad thing as I loved the book, but it does pose a problem to the writers. Had they directly adapted it, the action would've been mostly limited to the Yarpen's caravan and the confrontation with Rience. \n\nBesides those events, the story would've just featured Ciri being trained by the witchers, Ciri being educated by Nenneke, and Ciri being educated by Yennefer. It would have almost exclusively revolved around Geralt and Ciri, as well as Yennefer as well in the later half. The audience would not have been able to feel a connection or care about other characters nor do I think enough setup would have been made for the next seasons. There would also be very few other plotlines to entice the general audience. I don't know how well it would have worked for television.\n\nAs such, I think it is important they gave Yennefer her own storyline prior to meeting Ciri. The audience would want to know what happened between seasons 1 and 2. They want to see more of her in the early season, rather than just have her appear midway through the season to help Ciri. Giving Geralt his mystery to solve regarding the obelisks I think also helped explain Ciri's powers better to the audience and gave him something more to do and a mystery for the audience to care about.\n\nI'm also glad they spent plenty of time on Thanedd and with Dijkstra to set up the key event of the Time of Contempt. I personally also think it made sense that they handled the elves the way they did. Instead of the Scoia'tael just appearing on screen without any setup and having their motivations explained through exposition, for the general audience the elves now have much stronger motivation to aid the Nilfgaardians and they care about Francesca. It also allowed for an earlier introduction of Emhyr and show his ruthlessness. It adds to the political intrigue, which was my favorite part of Game of Thrones.\n\nI can go on, but the way I see it the deviations from the books were done to set up the characters and events that will be happening in the upcoming seasons and to make the audience care about them. I imagine for instance what the Red Wedding would have been like if Game of Thrones hadn't spent time setting all of these events up. The writers had to deviate from the books and also devise some of their own plotlines to make the audience care about the characters and understand what is happening.\n\nAnd I have no doubt that for instance the mother-daughter relationship between Yennefer and Ciri will instead happen next season, as indicated by the last episode. I feel that instead of directly adapting Blood of the Elves, they also already prepared the audience for Time of Contempt while some of the other events from Blood of the Elves will instead take place next season. And it will make the key event of Time of Contempt that much more rewarding and enjoyable.\n\nAnd again, I'm also disappointed with some of the choices they made. Funnily enough, one of the things I looked forward to most was the fight between an elixered up and very angry Geralt and the Michelet brothers. The book really set them up as these really dangerous, highly trained murderers. And when push comes to shove, Geralt just absolutely kicks their ass. It would've added so much to Geralt and his bond with Ciri. It also would've been a much better introduction of Philippa. But alas, the Michelet brothers were just some goons and they fight in the Temple of Melitele for some reason.\n\nSo while the season was certainly flawed and there's lots of room for improvement, I certainly did enjoy it and understand the decisions the writers made. In the end, they were adapting a novel that I feel wasn't suited for television (while the upcoming ones are) and the deviations they made were for the benefit of the upcoming seasons. And in the end, I did enjoy it especially as I worried less about it being a 1:1 adaptation.\n\nI'm curious how everybody feels about this.",

Yen as a woman get more flack for her flaws because how could she even think about choosing power (that is her identity, all that she has left) over random girl she didn't even know at that moment. Later one she couldn't do it fully and even sacrificed herself to help. But to fans this is a place of no return.

        "title": "A simple change that would have made the Season 2 Yen-Ciri storyline less nonsensical - the showrunners missed a major opportunity.",
        "body": "Hi everyone! I'm not trying to start a 'books vs adaptation' debate, nor do I want to go into a whole season review - there are plenty of great threads already.\n\nWhat I would like to do is suggest a few changes that would have helped the showrunners pull of their new storylines as *tolerable* instead of *nonsensical - because honestly Yennefer's abduction and almost-sacrifice of Ciri was one of the most idiotic changes imo.* **IF THEY WERE GOING TO CHANGE THE PLOT ANYWAY, at the very least they should have written it better.**\n\n# \"Sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die.\"\n\nIt seems like such a huge missed opportunity to not include that quote, when this whole theme from Season 1 could have carried over to Season 2 - and perhaps not 'justified' Yennefer's actions but at least given them a good rationale and a more tolerable character arc.\n\nI do believe the showrunners were trying to go for that Tissaia callback with the stone and flower, but they didn't follow that up well enough. **Yen's failure to lift the stone in the hut obviously preyed on her insecurities and sense of powerlessness before she mastered her magic, as it was conjured up by Voleth Meir precisely so she would feel helpless and desperate in her post-magic life as she felt in her pre-magic life.** ***But the other lesson of the stone and flower was \"sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die\".*** This is part of the reason Yennefer felt so useless without her magic, that she has no reason for living, that she's nothing without it - the reasons she even considers sacrificing an innocent life for her own power in the show to avoid feeling as she did before - but there should have been more to it, and it could have tied into the whole Yen-Ciri story arc.\n\nThe other time Tissaia says \"sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die\" is after she turns the failed apprentices into eels at the pool, which was a big part of Yennefer's character development. Tissaia taught her the importance of control to magic practitioners, otherwise chaos would just consume them; and it also reminded her that even if they are useless in practicing magic they can still be a conduit and be used for something greater, something good, by those that can. **The showrunners should have emphasised this connection with \"sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die\" in Yen's decision to sacrifice Ciri,** which I think they failed to do, and failed to depict in any believable way.\n\nThey already leaned into the whole *\"she could destroy us all, she's a child of chaos, she mustn't fall into the wrong hands\"* thing with Triss earlier, so if Yennefer's arc showcased more of a similar reasoning, the show wouldn't have ruined the Yen-Ciri relationship for nothing the way they did. *If Ciri was unable to control her magic for example, it would have given her somewhat of a justification*. If Ciri didn't just portal them out after like 1 minute of training, but maybe Yen having to tap into Ciri or somethingmagicsomethingsomething. If Ciri got so agitated by the river that she collapsed the ground as she usually does (and maybe collapsed the horses into the river if we want to make it more serious) instead of performing a totally fine teleportation spell. **Yen then could have justifiably (though wrongly) believed that Ciri would be better off dead or with her power in the hands of someone who can actually use it. Because - you guessed it - sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die.**\n\nInstead, we see Ciri immediately succeeding, she's clearly capable, skilled in controlling her magic (nailed the portal, almost managed the bridge and did manage to get them across via an alternative), she's devoted to Geralt and trusts Yen. Yet Yen is still lying to her about Geralt being captured and still wants to kill her to get her power back, and that's just not a good plotline as far as I'm concerned. On the other hand, if Ciri *was* having trouble with magic, Yen's fear of being powerless would have been underscored by all the things she was taught to believe in Aretuza, including emphasising how much Tissaia shaped her life (which based on other scenes they clearly wanted to do anyway).\n\nAnd then that somewhat reasonable willingness to kill Ciri could have been rationalized and would have been part of Yen's development. As she spent more time with Ciri on their journey, and saw her kindness, and her loyalty to Geralt, Yen would have noticed that she feels more whole with a 'daughter' around than she ever did with magic but alone. **Ciri could've slowly succeeded in doing the magic Yen taught her towards the end of their journey, making Yen see that this flower may yet blossom under her tutelage.** Changing her mind *then* would've been a more impactful character moment, taking a stand against becoming another Fringilla sacrificing people for power or another Tissaia crushing eels for the greater good - she would've organically realised who she was and what was important for her. Because the way it is in the show, both the initial decision is insane and her change of heart really abrupt - she goes from lying and dragging Ciri towards death to regretting it and trying to khs in the span of a hot minute without any reason or believable character arc.\n\n**Making these small changes to the story still would've allowed the 'How could you Yen' drama with Geralt, still given Yen a reason to atone to Ciri and still maintained the dramatic payoff of her willingness to die for her in the finale. But it also would've given Yen a more believable rationale from the start, would have gradually solidified her change of heart and character moment to be less out-of-nowhere, and also let the 'she needs us both' part land more** as we would've seen a taste of Ciri's magic without Yen compared to Yen's tutelage over time (rather than making a portal on her first try in 1minute while someone's trying to burn down the room, that doesn't leave much room for development). I still wouldn't have liked the whole Voleth Meir Yen-Ciri plot particularly much, but they could have pulled it off a lot better I think.\n\n# Let me know whether you agree that my suggestions for re-framing / re-emphasising the story slightly would have made it slightly more tolerable for you, or what changes would you implement to make the plotline better, if they absolutely did want to go in that direction anyway? Thanks for reading! :D",

While I agree with most of them, what was a deal breaker for me is how they choose to depict Yennefer in the show. What makes Yennefer special in the books is not that she is the most powerful mage (Vilgefortz is actually stronger, and probably others are too). Yennefer is special because she has attitude, speaks her mind, is strong, intelligent, calculated. In the same time she is a real woman, elegant, refined and sensual. Overall Yennefer is a strong character which impose respect (she kinda reminds me of Claire from House of cards). She is \"Madam Yennefer\" who tells Ciri just after the assault on Stygga Castle : \"tidy up your hair, don't scoop\". There are just a handful of people which see behind her strong appearance. \n\nYennefer from the show is weak (even is they try to convince viewers that she is the strongest). She is vulnerable, impulsive, frail. With all do respect for the actress, she looks more like a girl than a woman (in some scenes she looks younger than Ciri). And there isn't any chemistry between she and Geralt, so their romance feels forced.\n\nI'm surprise that there are't more comments about what the show did to Yennefer's character.",

Fringilla mentions that when the Usurper took Nilfgaard, he had all the sorcerers locked up in this prison and she herself was in there for years until Emhyr came to rule. Safe to say she's still traumatized if the dream she had was anything to go by, the one where she speaks about people touching her in the dark. \n\nMy guess is, this is also why the Nilfgaardian mages are so much more submissive than those in the north, and why their loyalty to Emhyr is so fierce that some (like the chick at Sodden Hill) would even sacrifice their life for his cause. He was basically their savior after years of suffering.",

        "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Leshy - from a non-gamer/book reader perspective",
        "body": "So after a gamer/book reader friend recommended the Witcher, I binge-watched Season 1 in about a day. Just got done with Season 2 and thought I'd add my muted reaction because why not...\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Say what you want about the three main characters, the actors did great.\n- Sorry not sorry, I like Yen, probably because I have no idea how the OG Yennefer is supposed to be. Apparently way better than the one on the show, but I find her charming. More so than Triss who I feel like I’m just expected to care about because the writers say so. \n- Jaskier. More endearing than he was annoying in Season 1. Shite hair as always but looks good shirtless. Interested to see if they ever expand on that queer coding. \n- Goes without saying that the special effects were much improved. I didn’t even think they were distractingly bad in Season 1 (save for that damn dragon) but they were really cool here. The leshy, the bruxa, even the Jurassic World portal monsters...\n- Fight scenes were fun. Being based partly on a video game I expected Witcher to nail that and I think they did (for the most part). \n- Istredd’s face – I like looking at it. \n- The end twist with [Spoiler] (/s \"Ciri’s hedgehog dad being alive\" ) got me good. The only time the whole season I had a Holy Shit moment. \n\nThe Bad: \n\n- In a show called The Witcher, it’s funny that I didn’t give a shit about any of the dozens of other Witchers. Why is Geralt one of only like three who is shown to be able to hold his own in a fight lol? Even if he’s the strongest, it would have been good to get emotionally invested in this band of supposedly born and bred badasses. \n- Season 2, more than Season 1, was confusing to me in terms of the who/what/when/where/why. There’s a lot of lore here, and I could barely make sense of most of it. Hate to pull out the Game of Thrones comparison, but let’s be real – you didn’t need to read the books to get a good sense of who the major and minor players were, what they wanted, when and where they were all situated, and why they were doing what they did. \n- Following on from that, how is The Witcher already making the same mistakes late stage GOT did? Characters just seem to teleport to places – no sense of how much time has passed, how far they’ve travelled, etc. \n- I don’t actually care about Ciri or her bond with Geralt. I’ll chalk that up to the writing. They’re telling me I should care about this surrogate father-daughter pair, and I do think the chemistry is there. But I don’t buy the strength of that relationship. During the final battle I was like 'just stab this kid already'.\n- Same goes for Geralt and Yen, who, again, I think have great chemistry. But in Season 1 we’re supposed to believe they’re this conflicted power couple fated to be together…just because.  \n- Fringilla. Will somebody please get some decent styling for the one black woman on the show? And a more compelling storyline. Again I think the actor is good, but they give her so little to work with like, why even bother. \n\nThe Leshy: \n\n- I zone out every forking time they cut to Azkaban. Which means I have obviously missed a lot of important political intrigue and plot developments but there are only one and a half interesting characters in that place – Tissaia and her boyfriend. And that’s not enough to make me care about anything else going on with the Brotherhood of Moustache-Twirlers.",

Well, in episode three of the first season, during the Brotherhood's meeting where it's decided that Yennefer will be going to Nilfgaard instead of Aedirn, we hear Calanthe's name mentioned. How is it possible that our characters know who Calanthe is in the year 1210 (right before Yennefer's enchantment), six years before her birth? What am I missing here?",

        "title": "Things we liked/disliked in S2",
        "body": "Disclaimer:\n\nI am a huge fan of the books and the games, and in general I am much a bigger fan of sci-fi/fantasy literature than videogames or tv-shows. And yet, I can be quite critical of the Witcher book saga when I feel I must be. Sapkowski **is a brilliant writer, worlds apart from Netflix's writers, but I still prefer a few elements as depicted in the games compared to the books, and if I was a tv-show writer I would try to change a few things in the story, because I genuinely believe they cannot work in that medium otherwise.**\n\nFor me, the show has many flaws, but there are also things I enjoyed in S2.\n\n**Liked:**\n\n\\-I loved the sets of Kaer Morhen, Cintra, Tretogor, Oxenfurt (ok Oxenfurt's set wasn't given in its entirety, but the picture in the official site is breathtaking).\n\n\\-I loved Vereena, Nivellen, Filavandrel, Rience, Vilgefortz, Codringher&Fenn, Emhyr, Dijkstra, Coen, Triss, Lydia and Jarre in Season 2. Not saying they always had the best dialogue or scenes, but the portrayal, the attitude, the feeling, it's all there for me, they remind me of the uniqueness of the Witcher universe.\n\n\\-I actually loved most of the monsters in the season. Ok the dino designs were lazy, but they were exceptionally  big mf'ers so I could accept that they were not standard basilisks, and witchers could face problems against them.\n\n\\- I loved Rience's fire magic, the witcher signs, Stregobor's mental torture spell etc.\n\n\\-I loved the design of the Wild Hunt and the desolate world they were traversing.\n\n\\-The scene where the old elf is made to piss his pants, and later sacrificing himself, while the others board the ship. It shows a beaten member of a once proud race being totally humiliated but then finding the spark to commit a final act of defiance. It really felt like the Witcher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disliked:**\n\n\\-Lack of dialogue from the Blood of the Elves. **Sapkowski's strength is in his dialogue**, and it can translate **WONDERFULLY** in a tv-show. Characters repeating \"fuck\" and \"fucker\" , or \"we're family\" will not stay in people's memory as anything other than memes. On that note:\n\n\\- I outright hate the fact that the best dialogue from Blood of the Elves, the one between Yarpen and Ciri, is missing. FFS, this is it you hack frauds, this is the way to show the audience what this imaginary world feels like: Yarpen talking to Ciri about racism and lies!\n\n\\- The season revolving around Voleth Meir as a main antagonist. If she was just an agent of the Wild Hunt trying to find Ciri, I would have liked that (reminding me of the Crones in TW3), because I feel like the Aen Elle being involved too late in the book saga actually hurt them as antagonists.\n\n\\-Fringilla and Cahir's characters keep being awful. Making them fanatics is one of the worst decisisions  one could make when adapting the Witcher Saga.\n\n\\-Lack of politics outside the brotherhood of mages.\n\n\\-Tissaia being obsessed over Yennefer.\n\n\\-Ciri being possessed and Yennefer being on the fence about sacrificing her. The whole story is so contrived and lazy. Yennefer and Ciri's initial encounter  and their travel  was always much more interesting to me than Geralt's and Ciri's moments from Sword of Destiny. A cold woman like Yennefer that day by day warms to a little girl who needs her help is amazing storytelling from Sapkowsi. In the show, Ciri has no reason to become close to Yen, there is no way Yen can become a believable mother figure to her.\n\n\\- Even though I liked the fact the tv-show tried to depict the formation of an Elven-Nilfgaardian alliance ( because in the books we are being told but not shown),  the Voleth Meir subplot lessens the resolve and pragmatism of the Elven leaders, as it makes it seem that instead of having to make difficult political decisions they were trapped by an extraplanar entity.\n\n\\- Got no problem with Eskel dying. I loved him in the games, but he is not important in the books. But if you want to create emotional trauma, make him likeable and kill him off in the later half of the season.\n\n\\-The music in S2 is weak most of the time.",

However I don't see this as a miss cast but a bad choice is her costume/makeup design. Look at how different Ciri is from S1 to S2. They could definitely adjust Yen to be older looking though costume and makeup choices. Furthermore, alot of what makes her seem immature is not a casting issue but rather a writing issue. If you watch Anya in interviews she seems more than capable of playing the character Yen should be, but she hasn't been given the chance. Her lack lf connection to the character (unlike Henry's knowledge) could mean she has less input on how she is portrayed more accurately. \n\n\nOne thing I would say is that if they swapped the appreance of age between Triss and Yen. There would be a lot less complaints about Yen as a character.",

        "body": "Of all the characters in season 2, the only one that pissed me off is Francesca. She turns out to be the worst leader ever.\n\nFirst of all, she lures her people into the forest because she had a dream and is being manipulated by a demon. Then she decides to make an alliance with Fringella and takes her people to Cintra on the condition of helping  Nilfgaard in the war, which she says she is ready to do. \n\nThis alliance causes a hunt and a slaughter of all the elves of the North. But Francesca does nothing to help her own. She doesn't send anyone to save them. It's up to everyone to find ways to join Cintra or to rely on the compassion of humans like Jaskier to help them. Meanwhile, Francesca plays to little house on the prairie. She enjoys the beautiful gardens, the palace's luxurious rooms, the food and... does nothing. She doesn't push her people to train (it will take them months to start doing it), she doesn't try to push for the integration of her people with Nilfgaard, she doesn't impose laws and rules in order to to avoid any problems (such as spies). \n\nWhen Cahir returns and the elfs are finally pushed into training, what does Francesca's husband do? He brandishes a knife at a commander's throat for nothing. Okay, Cahir was a bit arrogant but his attitude was exactly that of a commander with new recruits. And he was even less violent or humiliating than some can be. But no, Filavandrel questions authority and makes it clear the elves don't accept human authority, which doesn't help to trust them at all. And then when the general of Nilfgaard starts to take matters into his own hands and hang some elves suspected of treason (because Francesca didn't explain the rules to them in wartime), their queen doesn't do anything and doesn't even seem to care about it. \n\nFrancesca then decides to betray her alliance with Fringella after having benefited for months from this alliance without giving anything in return. It's demonstrate absolute stupidity. Francesca is neither a politician, nor a strategist, nor a warrior, nor a leader.\n\nHer alliance with Nilfgaard has caused the North to hate the elves more and to slaughter them. She does nothing about that. Her people have no discipline and are not good at fighting. She never encourages them to use their time at Cintra to learn how to fight with the soldiers of Nilfgaard. Her baby is seen as a threat by the North. She wants to give up everything and just cultivate the land. But what land? Nilfgaard would give them Cintra if they were allies, if they are not they have nothing. And without allies, they have nowhere to go but also no protection against the hatred of all the north. Whether for her baby or for her people, Francesca should have done anything to make this alliance work. Instead, she only put her people in danger, proves to all humans the elves are what they think of them (spies, traitors, untrustworthy people, thieves...) and makes stupid and selfish decisions one after the other.\n\nWhen her baby is killed, she steals horses from Nilfgaard, while Fringella would have given her some if she had told her, and leaves the majority of her people in Cintra not knowing what will happen to them if Nilfgaard decides that elves are traitors who have broken their alliance. She will then, without real proof, take revenge by torturing and killing babies but without doing anything against the soldiers, king and politicians. It's the most cruel, stupid and unfair thing there is. She did nothing against the North when her people were being slaughtered but for her baby she will kill innocent babies but not the people responsible for the persecution of the elves.\n\nFrancesca keeps proving she is a weak person, an awful fanatic, a self-centered leader without judgment or intelligence, and the monster she accuses humans of being.\n\nShe really pissed me off and I hope she will die soon and the elves will be led by someone braver, smarter and more righteous.",

That they have a mentor-pupil relation. And that he was slowly becoming more attached to her.  \nSeriously ? She is the reason he still lives, she's not only his destiny, she's \"much more than that\". In Blood of Elves, he said to Yarpen Zigrin that the child is his, meaning his daughter. As soon as they reunite, he care to her as to her child. He even swallowed his damn pride to call Yennefer for help, for her. WHEN in the world does he address her as to a mere pupil?!\n\nAnd how can this woman possibly be more wrong than that?",

These quotes made me laugh, cry, think and above all made me fall in love with these authors\n\nFrom Steven Erikson. \"Denigration afflicted our vaunted ideals long ago, but such inflictions are difficult to measure, to rise up and point a finger to this place, this moment, and say: here, my friends, this was where our honour, our integrity died. The affliction was too insipid, too much a product of our surrendering mindful regard and diligence. The meanings of words lost their precision – and no-one bothered taking to task those who cynically abused those words to serve their own ambitions, their own evasion of personal responsibility. Lies went unchallenged, lawful pursuit became a sham, vulnerable to graft, and justice itself became a commodity, mutable in imbalance. Truth was lost, a chimera reshaped to match agenda, prejudices, thus consigning the entire political process to a mummer’s charade of false indignation, hypocritical posturing and a pervasive contempt for the commonry. Once subsumed, ideals and the honour created by their avowal can never be regained, except, alas, by outright, unconstrained rejection, invariably instigated by the commonry, at the juncture of one particular moment, one single event, of such brazen injustice that revolution becomes the only reasonable response. Consider this then a warning. Liars will lie, and continue to do so, even beyond being caught out. They will lie, and in time, such liars will convince themselves, will in all self-righteousness divest the liars of culpability. Until comes a time when one final lie is voiced, the one that can only be answered by rage, by cold murder, and on that day, blood shall rain down every wall of this vaunted, weaning society. -Impeached Guild Master’s Speech Semel Fural of the Guild of Sandal-Clasp Makers\"\n\nFrom Oda Eiichiro \"Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous? These terms have always changed throughout the course of history! Kids who have never seen peace and kids who have never seen war have different values! Those who stand at the top determine what's wrong and what's right! This very place is neutral ground! Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice! -Donquixote Doflamingo\"\n\n\"If we lose credibility just by admitting fault, we never had *any* to begin with! -Admiral Fujitora\"",

Unlike a lot of fantasy they seem to not be aging child characters up - which makes everything happening to Cintrilla that much more impactful (and where did they find this actress - she is doing amazing).  They are doing the gruff exterior not caring but interior caring too much Witcher perfectly.  I think they may be moving some things around in time and not sure the failed sorceresses turning into ells is from the books but if not it fit perfectly into the world so an addition that works.  They are also quickly getting the elven/human hatred, the sorceress/wizard hatred/distrust and general darkness of the world perfectly.  Does it stay this good?  \n\nThe annoying bard is also played well - and the song I can see why it became so popular but even more importantly it works for the bard character, Geralts character as he would hate it - and the themes of the show/books which are very much about the power of stories to change history/future.",

        "body": "Spoiler alert for season 2!\n\n1. Why did Yennefer lose her magic? She kept saying something about fire magic being troublesome. So, the fire at Sodden Hill was responsible? Why doesn't Fire fucker lose powers?\n\nAlso, how was Voleth Mier able to give her magic back? Why was her chaos access restored after she sacrificed herself for Ciri?\n\n2. What exactly is Dijkstra? Is he just a normal human with no powers?\n\nAlso what are the duties of male witches/Mages like Vilgefortz, Stregobor, Istredd? Are they also assigned as advisors to King/Queens like the female witches(Yennefer, Fringilla).\n\n3. Why did Cahir decide to support Fringilla after she killed the Generals? Wasn't this an act of treason/betrayal?\n\n4. Istredd mentioned that all the people at his Nilfgaardian dig site praised Emhyr. Also, Fringilla and Cahir act like Emhyr is someone amazing and a great ruler. Not just a blood thirsty king. Yet, Geralt and others act like Nilfgaard is horrible and Emhyr actually ordered the murder of a child. I am having trouble with this dichotomy.contradiction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. We see that fire fucker has a partner witch who hired him on behalf of her secret employer. At one point fire guy gives her the vial of mutagen from Kaer Mohren and her face melts. What exactly happened here? Did he give her a trick/fake vial?",

It's exactly how I imagined the songs when reading the books and how describe the events in an epic way and makes a legend out of them. I'm so so happy we actually have such perfect music in the adaptation considering we don't have anything like this when we're reading the books.\n\nI hope they keep up the good work for the next seasons as well\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the obvious.

Now I find myself spoiled for choice :)\n\nI must admit that I have a soft spot for **The Witcher S2** because of my history with the game. And to give the showrunners some credit, they did quite a comeback after a mediocre first season (Not saying S1 was *bad*, but my expectations were much higher than the final outcome). Without those confusing timeline jumps, it was easier to enjoy an interesting, smooth plotline. Actually, it was enough for me to hear >!The Wild Hunt!< mentioned in the first episode to vote for this show as my favorite this year :D \n\nThat said, I believe that **Arcane** was more complete. With an excellent character arc crafted throughout a brilliantly woven plot, I had to be fair and pick this show as my 2021 champion. (Sorry, Geralt, but I know you will kickass in season 3!)\n\nSo, what was your favorite in 2021?",

        "body": "What the actual hell did they do with his character? \n\nHe is easily my favorite witcher villain (and villain overall) and they just completely fucked him up. There is almost no resemblance to the books and it just makes me sad that so many viewers of the series will never see what a fantastic character Sapkowski has written...\n\nIt is even more stupid considering the actor is in my opinion a fantastic choice. His overall portrayal of Vilgefortz is absolutely spot on (Except for the fact that most of the scenes they put him into are idiotic, but even then his portrayal is fantastic).\n\nThere are so many things they simply did completely wrong:\n\n1.) First of all they just decide to gift the victory at Sodden Hill to Yennefer. In reality she is blinded whilst Vilgefortz demolishes the Nilfgaardian forces and is almost singlehandedly the reason for the northern kingdom's success. Instead they have Yennefer destroy Nilfgaard whilst Vilgefortz loses a sword fight to Cahir instead of actually being useful. Maybe he staged all that - we don't know yet - but if not that is completely ridiculous.\n\n2.) Then in season two him acting out rashly and getting mad when not receiving information on Ciri is completely out of character. He is in my opinion easily the smartest (or at least one of the smartest) and most calculated and powerful character in the books. Why couldn't we have seen him trying to get information behind everyones back? Of course there is Rience and Lydia, but it isn't even revealed that he is the person behind them. Even Rience, who is (imo) really boring in the books is so much cooler than Vilgefortz.\n\n3.) They even butcher his most iconic line by giving it to Fringilla, who doesn't even appear in the books until much later. Why did they have to make this weird \"friendship-bond-magic\" thing up between Ciri and Triss instead of Ciri having a Vision like in the books? I loved how Triss kind of \"magically engages\" Ciri during her Vision but Vilgefortz does the same (though from very far away) and tells Triss that she is in far over her head and \"mistakes stars reflected in a pond for those at the heavens\"? In the books after that Vilgefortz hosts a \"council\" with Tissaia, Terranova, Lydia, etc. where he uses his iconic line again. At that point - in the books - you can figure that Vilgefortz is looking for Ciri, though we don't know his intentions.\n\n4.) He is just far too weak. They could have established Vilgefortz as extremely powerful through the Vision in point 3 by having Triss telling the witchers after the Vision that only an incredibly skilled mage could do what Vilgefortz just did.",

        "body": "So this week I managed to watch all of Season 2 of the Witcher and I really enjoyed it. So I thought I'd share my thoughts on the series (with spoilers for the show and books). To clarify I really like all things Witcher. Witcher 3 led me to the Books (like Cavil) which are still my favourite. Overall, the Witcher show is probably the Witcher thing I like love the least, but I still think it is brilliant. Okay, time for gushing and spoilers:\n\nEpisode 1 was great. It reminded me a lot of season 1, but with the added twist of Geralt and Ciri being together and Ciri losing a lot of naivety which she has about monsters. There's the helpful and kind bruxa vs the sinister and brooding black eyed Geralt, but one will protect her to the death, and the other would kill her without a second thought. Also Nivellen was a great sympathetic character.  \n\nI really enjoyed all of the plot arcs and character arcs, especially Yennefer's. The best thing the show has done is add flesh to Yennefer. In the books she is given the least to do of the three leads so she has fewer clear motivations. In Season 2 the lose of her magic from using fire magic is a great move (and foreshadows a similar event in Time of Contempt). It gives her proper motives which she lacked in Blood of Elves. Her time with Jaskier were my favourite moments and I especially loved how she went back to help him (I wondered how she'd burn Rience's face without magic and that was a glorious moment).   \n\nKaer Morhen was fun. I enjoyed time with the other Witchers. I really didn't get worked up over Eskel being bumped off. He's a very minor character in the books, but he was my favourite of the Witchers in TW3 (I wish we had a quest with him like we had with Lambert). My one quibble here was that they seemed to get from Cintra to Kaer Morhen far too quickly. \n\nThe Elven Arc was very well done to my mind. The politics of it all was very good. Francesca didn't have a baby in the books, but it set up a great arc for the elves and the politics of the North. Same for Cahir and Fringilla Vigo. I am curious to see what becomes of them (especially Cahir's arc). I want so much more of the politics and am really looking forwards to Season 3. I know most of the politics comes in Time of Contempt. I'm excited because that is the book which I re-read the least (>!Blame The Rats!<), and I am excited to see what Lauren and the show runners do with it). I loved all of the politics scenes and I want more Dijkstra/Phillipa & Codringer/Fenn especially. They were all awesome. The politics of the Brotherhood and the Conclave interested me the least, but I think that's because I know what's coming.\n\nMy only other quibbles where that I wanted to see more of Yarpen Zigrin and his crew as well as the Temple of Melitele. and I didn't think Emperor Emyhr should have revealed he was looking for his daughter. The reveal of who he is to the audience is brilliant and makes sense since they couldn't reveal it the same way as the books. But Dijkstra says early on that he knows nothing about Emyhr. I have to imagine someone in that thrown room would be willing to spill to Redenia for a few crowns. Again though, those are minor quibbles.\n\nTo conclude I want more! More of it all, but especially more politics, more Jaskier, and more monster fighting. The deviations from the book really didn't bother me because the overall arc remains the same. Everyone is after Ciri and Geralt and Yen will have their work cut out for them. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Have you read the books or just the show? \n\nP.S. Thanks to everyone who liked my last post on this subreddit. It's the most popular post I've ever made thank to you.\n\nP.S.S. I also loved how the dock worker was the guy who played Cleaver and many other Novigrad NPCs in TW3 Alastair Parker was criticising Jaskier for Season 1. It was very meta criticism of Gamers who rag at the show.",

In Season 2 the lose of her magic from using fire magic is a great move (and foreshadows a similar event in Time of Contempt). It gives her proper motives which she lacked in Blood of Elves. Her time with Jaskier were my favourite moments and I especially loved how she went back to help him (I wondered how she'd burn Rience's face without magic and that was a glorious moment).   \n\nKaer Morhen was fun. I enjoyed time with the other Witchers. I really didn't get worked up over Eskel being bumped off. He's a very minor character in the books, but he was my favourite of the Witchers in TW3 (I wish we had a quest with him like we had with Lambert). My one quibble here was that they seemed to get from Cintra to Kaer Morhen far too quickly. \n\nThe Elven Arc was very well done to my mind. The politics of it all was very good. Francesca didn't have a baby in the books, but it set up a great arc for the elves and the politics of the North. Same for Cahir and Fringilla Vigo. I am curious to see what becomes of them (especially Cahir's arc). I want so much more of the politics and am really looking forwards to Season 3. I know most of the politics comes in Time of Contempt. I'm excited because that is the book which I re-read the least (>!Blame The Rats!<), and I am excited to see what Lauren and the show runners do with it). I loved all of the politics scenes and I want more Dijkstra/Phillipa & Codringer/Fenn especially. They were all awesome. The politics of the Brotherhood and the Conclave interested me the least, but I think that's because I know what's coming.\n\nMy only other quibbles where that I wanted to see more of Yarpen Zigrin and his crew as well as the Temple of Melitele. and I didn't think Emperor Emyhr should have revealed he was looking for his daughter. The reveal of who he is to the audience is brilliant and makes sense since they couldn't reveal it the same way as the books. But Dijkstra says early on that he knows nothing about Emyhr. I have to imagine someone in that thrown room would be willing to spill to Redenia for a few crowns. Again though, those are minor quibbles.\n\nTo conclude I want more! More of it all, but especially more politics, more Jaskier, and more monster fighting. The deviations from the book really didn't bother me because the overall arc remains the same. Everyone is after Ciri and Geralt and Yen will have their work cut out for them. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Have you read the books or just the show? \n\nP.S. Thanks to everyone who liked my last post on this subreddit. It's the most popular post I've ever made thank to you.\n\nP.S.S. I also loved how the dock worker was the guy who played Cleaver and many other Novigrad NPCs in TW3 Alastair Parker was criticising Jaskier for Season 1. It was very meta criticism of Gamers who rag at the show.",

        "body": "This post is **not** another _it was different in the books!_ pitchfork waving. It was inspired by u/Freman747, u/k995 and countless other colleagues on reddit who point out there's a lot of shallow criticism of season 2 _as a tv show_. Thank you for pushing for quality discussions.\n\nI'll try to keep it show-only with no reference to other material. Call me out if i bend it too much. \n\nI'll avoid using trope names. An example of a named trope is ['idiot plot'](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot), pointed out to wider audience by Roger Ebert - a situation that would be easily solvable if only the characters weren't idiots out of a sudden. I encourage you to drop down the rabbit hole of [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/), maybe starting with [what they have on the Witcher show.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWitcher2019)\n\nSpoilers for the show.\n\n**Witchers**\n\nNightmare of the Wolf establishes there were only five witchers at the end, and season 2 of the main show confirms that the ways of making new witchers are lost. Over a dozen new witchers are added for the show, ramping their numbers to 'about 20'. We know from the show they couldn't have been created recently, so it's safe to assume they were created _soon_ after Geralt or came from other places (and didn't bring any new methods of creation with them). This makes all of the presented witchers at least 60-year-old, mutated, trained elite monster hunters, experienced in their craft if they survived for so long.\n\nWe're shown a band of incompetent nincompoops. They risk exposing Kaer Morhen to outsiders by having a party - it's explained with the plan to wipe out memories of all outsiders, a decent wave of hand, but the risk is _their home and very existence_. They survived for so long, in part thanks to the secrecy of Kaer Morhen after the events of NotW, and now they risk it all for an orgy. It would be better if the orgy part happened in a nearby town, but (1) there really isn't any, Kaer Morhen being a remote ruin, and (2) the writers wanted to show more of Kaer Morhen, whatever the cost to character integrity. \n\nIn the last episodes, it gets worse. There's a powerful ancient entity showing up at Kaer Morhen and just murdering witchers in their sleep. There are no guards. No one senses anything, no medallion goes crazy (they did vibrate during Eskel/leshy events, but not now). Voleth Meir's plot armour is extremely thick at the expense of witchers.\n\nThe fight with the summoned basilisks just reinforces that. Even if they're a version of basilisk not known on the Continent, they're shown as, essentially, just teeth and claws. They are not shown to do anything that should be surprising to witchers. Their size is should be a weakness in closed quarters in a keep hall. Yet they successfully maim and kill multiple witchers, high on the witcher elixir. Later in the same scene, we're shown Geralt single-handedly kill one of the basilisks, without even using the elixir. \n\nThe witchers are written as a bunch of incompetent nincompoops. They're not characters - they're a plot device used to describe something around them, a tool to be used and then discarded. The only reason to include them is to have them killed, to show that _monsters are powerful_ and that _stakes are high_. Downplaying a supposedly strong character as just a comment on someone else's power level is a lazy writing technique, overused to death - it should be left in Dragon Ball.\n\n**Eskel**\n\nI absolutely don't mind Eskel dying. The problem here is not with killing him, as it could have been a decent plot twist if handled better.\n\nEskel is confirmed to be of the Wolf school and one of the \"Vesemir's boys\", with long established relations between him and other Wolves. He's shown coming to Kaer Morhen after a fight with a leshy and openly saying he was wounded. No other witcher wants to take a look at the wound. It's especially odd for Vesemir - he's shown to have a kind of laboratory of his own and be very hands-on during the later section of Eskel's corpse. It's also odd for Eskel, who wouldn't discuss his wound or ask anyone to look at it. It's out of character for witchers and an idiot plot on its own - the surprising transformation can happen only because they haven't they talked as they should have.\n\nI saw someone's theory that the Eskel we get to see is already 'corrupted' by the leshy infection, that he already acts more aggressively, which explains why he doesn't talk about his wound. If we follow that explanation, it means no one noticed the change in him, no one sensed anything wrong, and no one picked up on a leshy among them, including Vesemir. The whole subplot stands only because everyone around dropped their IQ by 50 for the needs of the plot. Besides, Eskel eventually does say he's there to seek help, but it's already too late and he's overtaken by the leshy infection.\n\n**Vesemir**\n\nThe points above already paint a pretty bad picture of Vesemir, happy to risk an orgy in Kaer Morhen (having survived the events of Nightmare of the Wolf!) and being just another incompetent nincompoop in other scenes. I liked how he pushed to figure out what happened to Eskel and only gave up after Geralt said they should let Eskel rest. He contradicts himself as a knowledgeable elder by agreeing to inject Ciri with the mutagen - it has been established girls cannot pass the trials, but he's happy to oblige just to deliver some tension in the scene at the expense of his own character. \n\nGiven how he cares about his boys and how he's shown pushing for answers during the section of Eskel's corpse, it was odd he didn't push for finding a way to contain and cure him when they had Eskel-leshy chained up. Death of Eskel in general and the Eskel-leshy scene in particular were written to create an early parallel to Vesemir stabbing Ciri in the final episode; it's painful to kill a child (Eskel - figurative child to Vesemir, Ciri - an actual child and an adopted child to Geralt), but _it has to be done_. \n\nVesemir is shown as a character of contradictions - and not because of his deep morality or development over the season, but the way he is written. He contradicts himself and requires so much suspension of disbelief for his motivations there is none left for other witchers.\n\n**Fringilla**\n\nAfter getting posted to Nilfgaard back in season 1, Fringilla has been shown as a devoted follower of the White Flame, a zealous believer and loyal subject to Emhyr. Season 1 established that mages in Nilfgaard are kept on a short leash, serving the state with little agency of their own.\n\nSomehow Fringilla has the authority to use the capital of Cintra and give it over to elves. She does it to get a valuable ally for Nilfgaard, but it's shown that Nilfgaardian officers are not on board with that plan. There's no explanation to why suddenly a Nilfgaardian mage is much more than a tool, a means to end, and actually has control over _the capital of a conquered kingdom_. Fringilla's rise in ranks and tension with the officers happens only because she needed a subplot and a character arc, but it contradicts everything known about Nilfgaard, its structure and overall motivations. \n\nThe conflict with officers is almost a character self-assassination. A devoted and loyal follower of Emhyr decides to kill Nilfgaardian soldiers, kill a Nilfgaardian officer just to prove a point, and leave another officer alive as a witness assuming he will testify on her behalf despite the disagreements already shown between Fringilla and Cahir. A devoted and loyal follower of Emhyr decides to _lie to Emhyr's face_, trying to salvage a situation that got out of control - a situation she got herself into with no orders from the emperor. \n\nIt's a disservice to Fringilla herself, showing her falling apart rather than building or developing her character. It makes even less sense for her to assume any sort of authority or make grand plans after the loss at Sodden. Her arc in season 2 is reminiscent of a run-of-the-mill teenage drama, not written as downfall from getting overly ambitious as it could have been.\n\n**Yennefer**\n\nSpeaking of teenage drama: enter Yennefer. Season 1 established her as confident and collected, strong in the face of difficulty and failure. Where did that Yennefer go in season 2? She's a powerful mage, almost 90 years old; she has seen, experienced and survived more than most people of the Continent can even imagine. Her character was reduced to a youngster who can't handle her emotions too well. Her dialogues have worsened when compared to season 1; the number of the 'fuck' word utterances over doubled in season 2 vs season 1 (~120 vs ~45), and most of it is Yennefer. From a decadent powerful woman of season 1 she got written into a conflicted trope straight from a generic young adult fantasy series. \n\nLauren Hissrich said they didn't want to leave out Yennefer of season 2 so they came up with something new for her. Fair enough, if only her arc made more sense and her character did justice to her season 1 portrayal.\n\nShe's said to have lost her power for using fire magic. Rience is shown to use fire magic completely fine, and he's pretty good at it - can't be his first time. Not sure if explicitly stated in the show or theorized by some fellow viewers, but apparently Rience's usage of fire magic also comes at a cost: he's getting increasingly insane, losing his mind. Alright; why didn't Yennefer go that route then? Instead of losing her power, she could get increasingly more violent and trying to get even more power. It would fit the 'consumed by flame' idea, it would fit with Rience, it would fit her original motivation of getting more and more powerful (Voleth Meir would just promise her _more power_ or power to revert her infertility). It would fit in with Yennefer being happy to deliver a young girl to an elder spirit in her obssession for power, until she'd connect more with Ciri and be able to shake it off, giving up power for Ciri.\n\nIt would fit in the world, the story so far, Rience, and would give good explanation for what Yennefer would do over season 2. It's clear the writing was supposed to show her being fully capable and strong in her own right, even without magic, which is a nice story on its own but comes at a big narrative and worldbuilding cost given the wider context. Ignoring what has been established so far and what is presented with other elements of the world is a rookie writing mistake and a huge problem with season 2 in general.\n\nThe 'useful and capable even without powers' is most evident in the elven ruins scene. Francesca, an elven mage and a respected leader, couldn't read all the ancient elven writing. Yennefer read them on the spot, completely no issue for her. That scene speaks mostly about Yennefer, and while it comes off as showing 'Yen is smart and knows things', it also says 'Francesca knows less than Yen'. Character exposition at the cost of another character _you're also trying to introduce and build up_ is another cheap trick that worked in DBZ.\n\nIn Kaer Morhen, in the last episode, Yennefer is making a potion that's supposed to help against Voleth Meir - paraphrasing, she said _i'm a witch, potions is something i do best and i can do even without my chaos_. The potion is never used or mentioned ever again.\n\nThen there's the whole subplot with Cahir. Yennefer was reluctant to kill to 'prove her innocence', even if it was a confirmed Nilfgaardian baddie. She's not a stone cold killer. That's fair enough, but why did she take Cahir along? She did more than enough freeing him. He's a random dude for her at this point, and one that was involved in sacking of Cintra. He was on the other side at Sodden. Why grab him on a horse with her? The future plot needs Cahir in a specific place, and he needs to be written out of a corner that the writers put him in in the first place by bringing him to Aretuza. But why the in-universe Yennefer cared? The plot of destiny thickens.\n\nBonus: Yennefer lost her power, has no Chaos, is shown to try to cast spells and fails. She can't cast any spells. She casts the 'hut hut' spell when with Geralt, and they get to the Hut just fine. \n\nBonus #2: Yennefer is a fugitive in Oxenfurt. Doing her best not to be found. She hides her hair and face under a big hood. She really doesn't want to be found and discovered. She wears a bright purple cloak.\n\n**Jaskier**\n\nJaskier's role in season 2 is written in a similar vein and it comes at no surprise he spent a lot of time with Yennefer - his 'elven smuggler' subplot was added to extend his screen time and establish _some_ basis for Yennefer to rescue him later from Rience.\n\nWe first hear of a 'Sandpiper' who helps smuggling elves from Oxenfurt to Cintra. Given he has already earned a monicker, it stands to reason that he's been doing it for a while. Yet we're shown he's having trouble getting through a dock master. Has he always been lucky with no one at the dock during his previous deeds? We're to believe he's had an established smuggling operation, but he was shown winging it and hoping it works. The whole dock scene was there to add some extra tension and introduce a small redemption arc for the unnamed gentleman from the sewers, but it felt flat, with just another disposable side character to use to get out of a corner the writers got the story into.\n\nJaskier's relations with Geralt are at least confusing now. They were developing an actual friendship over season 1, only for it to be discarded by the end - yet Geralt runs to his aid, _all the way to Oxenfurt_, as if he didn't have pressing issues at hand. Why? - other than the need to bring the characters together, which felt forced between them.\n\nThe bard's involvement in Kaer Morhen was equally as odd or worse. He was given a side quest he couldn't complete and that turned out to have no importance anyway - the whole 'special stone' idea was a poorly delivered filler to have Jaskier and Yennefer do _something_. He felt out of place because he was written to reach Kaer Morhen just to 'bring the band together', and the writing didn't deliver on giving him any fleshed out role, not even as character foil to Geralt or a competent sidekick to Yennefer. Sometimes less is more, and skipping something with a decent wave of hand is better than an out-of-place character doing random things or suddenly being incompetent in their supposed strengths.\n\n**Voleth Meir**\n\nI actually liked the general concept for Voleth Meir (going with she/her for simplicity). I wish it was a self-contained subplot with better attention to detail, but hey - it wasn't a bad premise.\n\nSome detail was a wasted opportunity. She's based on Baba Yaga, with the chicken-leg house and all that. She appears as an elderly Ithlinne, as a young girl (young Yen / Ciri), and as... a dude in full armour (implied to be Emhyr). The missed opportunity of her appearing to one of the ladies as an adult woman indicates the writers didn't do their homework or decided to just cherry-pick for no good reason. Appearing as a vision of an adult woman instead of an iron-clad man would fit the 'mother, maiden, and the crone' archetype and give Voleth Meir extra depth. It would also fit the Baba Yaga inspiration more, who is sometimes depicted as three sisters rather than a single person. Taking inspiration and adapting it to a modern audience is absolutely fine - it's great! - but some ideas come as a package deal, if you pick only some elements it feels incomplete.\n\nVoleth Meir is a victim of the idiot plot, too. She's an ancient and powerful entity, she knows what Ciri is, she knows Elder Blood. I get that she wanted to get revenge on witchers for her capture (even if it were completely different witchers), but as she was discovered she still stayed around. She's shown opening a portal to another sphere and drawing out monsters, then just standing there. Why? Why didn't she portal out when yrden weakened and failed, leaving everyone behind with no way to follow her? Why didn't she open a portal for the Wild Hunt to join her but summoned only basilisks? Just a moment later we're shown that Ciri, without Voleth Meir powers, was able to reach Wild Hunt on her own. She could have ported anywhere, keep Ciri as a powerful vessel, and come back for more destruction with her allies. It wasn't possible for her because Good Had To Win, Ciri could not become a permanent vessel to a powerful alien being, all main cast couldn't die - because the overall story requires it, but it lacked good explanation and substance in-universe.\n\nVoleth Meir's specific writing and adding her to the Wild Hunt seems to be directed towards a spin-off. It's nice to be getting more stories told in the Witcher universe, but using the 'main series' to jumpstart spin-offs should be done more carefully, otherwise it hurts the main series itself (everything should make full sense within the series you watch, then be _expanded_ and built upon in other works of the extended universe). Voleth Meir would be great as a self-contained antagonist of the show (written slightly differently to fit it), and not aligning her with the Wild Hunt would help with her idiot plot issues.\n\nIt's entirely possible Voleth Meir is not mentioned in any spin-offs and her involvement with the Wild Hunt is explored in greater depth in the subsequent seasons, making total sense of what we were shown over season 2. I'll eat my words then.\n\n**Ciri**\n\nElder Blood is treated literally. Feainnewedd grows where Ciri's blood was spilled, as she notes about the training course at Kaer Morhen. Are we to believe she never bled during her entire life, sprouting new feainnewedd and making Mousesack or Calanthe suspicious what's happening? Did they notice the odd rare flowers growing here and there around Cintra, but just shrugged it off? After Pavetta's wedding, at least Mousesack would be looking for any signs of magic or oddity from Ciri.\n\n**North**\n\nThe 'Cahir uses get out of jail for free card' scene also suggests the mages are less than thoughtful. We were told there is a spell at the monument site that prevents any use of magic - that's fair. I guess we're supposed to assume they just come in weaponless, powerless, and clueless, meet with monarchs and plan an execution with no backup plan or security put in place. It was enough to escape a site _full of mages and monarchs_ by just knocking over two big braziers and finding a horse, conveniently parked for someone to make a great escape. \n\nRience teleports into and out of Kaer Morhen, the secret witcher keep up in the mountains whose location is known only to the selected few.\n\n**The World**\n\nThere is a [map available on the show's site](https://www.witchernetflix.com/en). Open it and take a look. Find Kaer Morhen, Aretuza, Oxenfurt, and Cintra.\n\nJaskier is smuggling elves from Oxenfurt to Cintra. Is he just shipping them across the sea, not caring about pirates? Passing through Novigrad ports? \n\nYennefer and Ciri take a quick portal from Ellander to a hut near Cintra. The hut was the home of two peasants who helped Ciri back in season one. The hut and the couple are charred, burned to the bone. There's only charcoal and ash, the event must have taken place some time ago, as there are no visible embers. Yet just outside of the hut there are two horses, ready to be taken by our ladies for a trip. Fed, saddled horses. \n\nYennefer and Ciri arrive at the monolith scar near Cintra just as Geralt catches up to them, traveling on horseback, all the way from Ellander. What a fortunate timing.\n\nAfterwards, Geralt tells Jaskier and Yarpen to take Ciri back to Kaer Morhen. _Look at the map_, look at the distance between Cintra and Kaer Morhen. Yarpen and his crew are feisty fighters, but they are not seen at Kaer Morhen afterwards. The secretive keep of witchers that is kept secret, but Yarpen and Jaskier supposedly somehow know where to go. And they don't comment how long will it take.\n\nWhen Francesca, Fringilla and Yennefer arrive at Voleth Meir's hut, we're shown they get there through a passage under a shattered monolith in elven ruins. It must be near Sodden and/or Cintra. When Voleth Meir is freed, she just flies off and possesses Ciri (who is supposedly at Kaer Morhen already or close to it). Yennefer and Geralt make the same distance soon after learning that the hut is empty, and they can't have taken long since they arrive _just in time_ to confront Voleth Meir / Ciri as she's killing off witchers there.\n\nLittlefinger's teleporting device was found on the Continent. Continuity issues like this, completely disregarding the established world to fit it to the plot, are the worst kind of lazy writing.\n\n\n\n\nA good number of these issues can still be explained in subsequent seasons (i have no doubt some will), some of them can be explained with extensive theorycrafting and strong headcanon (which may or may not make sense), but a lot of it is just what's bad about the show.\n\nThere are some absolute purists who keep dwelling on how a character in the show had a wrong hairdo or how their eye colour doesn't match what was in the books, but that's a tiny minority that even other book fans don't take too seriously. The main problem with the show is that it's full of holes, inconsistencies, deus ex machina solutions, cheap tricks, and just bad writing. If it wasn't branded under Witcher franchise and _actually well based on the books where it does follow them_, going just by the original writing we've seen so far it would be just another teenage fantasy drama sitting at 4/10 rating. Conversely, the parts that actually follow the books (even with changes and creative writing) are universally well-received, like s2 e1 with Nivellen. The changes and additions are just off in the overall spirit of the franchise and its world.",

They survived for so long, in part thanks to the secrecy of Kaer Morhen after the events of NotW, and now they risk it all for an orgy. It would be better if the orgy part happened in a nearby town, but (1) there really isn't any, Kaer Morhen being a remote ruin, and (2) the writers wanted to show more of Kaer Morhen, whatever the cost to character integrity. \n\nIn the last episodes, it gets worse. There's a powerful ancient entity showing up at Kaer Morhen and just murdering witchers in their sleep. There are no guards. No one senses anything, no medallion goes crazy (they did vibrate during Eskel/leshy events, but not now). Voleth Meir's plot armour is extremely thick at the expense of witchers.\n\nThe fight with the summoned basilisks just reinforces that. Even if they're a version of basilisk not known on the Continent, they're shown as, essentially, just teeth and claws. They are not shown to do anything that should be surprising to witchers. Their size is should be a weakness in closed quarters in a keep hall. Yet they successfully maim and kill multiple witchers, high on the witcher elixir. Later in the same scene, we're shown Geralt single-handedly kill one of the basilisks, without even using the elixir. \n\nThe witchers are written as a bunch of incompetent nincompoops. They're not characters - they're a plot device used to describe something around them, a tool to be used and then discarded. The only reason to include them is to have them killed, to show that _monsters are powerful_ and that _stakes are high_. Downplaying a supposedly strong character as just a comment on someone else's power level is a lazy writing technique, overused to death - it should be left in Dragon Ball.\n\n**Eskel**\n\nI absolutely don't mind Eskel dying. The problem here is not with killing him, as it could have been a decent plot twist if handled better.\n\nEskel is confirmed to be of the Wolf school and one of the \"Vesemir's boys\", with long established relations between him and other Wolves. He's shown coming to Kaer Morhen after a fight with a leshy and openly saying he was wounded. No other witcher wants to take a look at the wound. It's especially odd for Vesemir - he's shown to have a kind of laboratory of his own and be very hands-on during the later section of Eskel's corpse. It's also odd for Eskel, who wouldn't discuss his wound or ask anyone to look at it. It's out of character for witchers and an idiot plot on its own - the surprising transformation can happen only because they haven't they talked as they should have.\n\nI saw someone's theory that the Eskel we get to see is already 'corrupted' by the leshy infection, that he already acts more aggressively, which explains why he doesn't talk about his wound. If we follow that explanation, it means no one noticed the change in him, no one sensed anything wrong, and no one picked up on a leshy among them, including Vesemir. The whole subplot stands only because everyone around dropped their IQ by 50 for the needs of the plot. Besides, Eskel eventually does say he's there to seek help, but it's already too late and he's overtaken by the leshy infection.\n\n**Vesemir**\n\nThe points above already paint a pretty bad picture of Vesemir, happy to risk an orgy in Kaer Morhen (having survived the events of Nightmare of the Wolf!) and being just another incompetent nincompoop in other scenes. I liked how he pushed to figure out what happened to Eskel and only gave up after Geralt said they should let Eskel rest. He contradicts himself as a knowledgeable elder by agreeing to inject Ciri with the mutagen - it has been established girls cannot pass the trials, but he's happy to oblige just to deliver some tension in the scene at the expense of his own character. \n\nGiven how he cares about his boys and how he's shown pushing for answers during the section of Eskel's corpse, it was odd he didn't push for finding a way to contain and cure him when they had Eskel-leshy chained up. Death of Eskel in general and the Eskel-leshy scene in particular were written to create an early parallel to Vesemir stabbing Ciri in the final episode; it's painful to kill a child (Eskel - figurative child to Vesemir, Ciri - an actual child and an adopted child to Geralt), but _it has to be done_. \n\nVesemir is shown as a character of contradictions - and not because of his deep morality or development over the season, but the way he is written. He contradicts himself and requires so much suspension of disbelief for his motivations there is none left for other witchers.\n\n**Fringilla**\n\nAfter getting posted to Nilfgaard back in season 1, Fringilla has been shown as a devoted follower of the White Flame, a zealous believer and loyal subject to Emhyr. Season 1 established that mages in Nilfgaard are kept on a short leash, serving the state with little agency of their own.\n\nSomehow Fringilla has the authority to use the capital of Cintra and give it over to elves. She does it to get a valuable ally for Nilfgaard, but it's shown that Nilfgaardian officers are not on board with that plan. There's no explanation to why suddenly a Nilfgaardian mage is much more than a tool, a means to end, and actually has control over _the capital of a conquered kingdom_. Fringilla's rise in ranks and tension with the officers happens only because she needed a subplot and a character arc, but it contradicts everything known about Nilfgaard, its structure and overall motivations. \n\nThe conflict with officers is almost a character self-assassination. A devoted and loyal follower of Emhyr decides to kill Nilfgaardian soldiers, kill a Nilfgaardian officer just to prove a point, and leave another officer alive as a witness assuming he will testify on her behalf despite the disagreements already shown between Fringilla and Cahir. A devoted and loyal follower of Emhyr decides to _lie to Emhyr's face_, trying to salvage a situation that got out of control - a situation she got herself into with no orders from the emperor. \n\nIt's a disservice to Fringilla herself, showing her falling apart rather than building or developing her character. It makes even less sense for her to assume any sort of authority or make grand plans after the loss at Sodden. Her arc in season 2 is reminiscent of a run-of-the-mill teenage drama, not written as downfall from getting overly ambitious as it could have been.\n\n**Yennefer**\n\nSpeaking of teenage drama: enter Yennefer. Season 1 established her as confident and collected, strong in the face of difficulty and failure. Where did that Yennefer go in season 2? She's a powerful mage, almost 90 years old; she has seen, experienced and survived more than most people of the Continent can even imagine. Her character was reduced to a youngster who can't handle her emotions too well. Her dialogues have worsened when compared to season 1; the number of the 'fuck' word utterances over doubled in season 2 vs season 1 (~120 vs ~45), and most of it is Yennefer. From a decadent powerful woman of season 1 she got written into a conflicted trope straight from a generic young adult fantasy series. \n\nLauren Hissrich said they didn't want to leave out Yennefer of season 2 so they came up with something new for her. Fair enough, if only her arc made more sense and her character did justice to her season 1 portrayal.\n\nShe's said to have lost her power for using fire magic. Rience is shown to use fire magic completely fine, and he's pretty good at it - can't be his first time. Not sure if explicitly stated in the show or theorized by some fellow viewers, but apparently Rience's usage of fire magic also comes at a cost: he's getting increasingly insane, losing his mind. Alright; why didn't Yennefer go that route then? Instead of losing her power, she could get increasingly more violent and trying to get even more power. It would fit the 'consumed by flame' idea, it would fit with Rience, it would fit her original motivation of getting more and more powerful (Voleth Meir would just promise her _more power_ or power to revert her infertility). It would fit in with Yennefer being happy to deliver a young girl to an elder spirit in her obssession for power, until she'd connect more with Ciri and be able to shake it off, giving up power for Ciri.\n\nIt would fit in the world, the story so far, Rience, and would give good explanation for what Yennefer would do over season 2. It's clear the writing was supposed to show her being fully capable and strong in her own right, even without magic, which is a nice story on its own but comes at a big narrative and worldbuilding cost given the wider context. Ignoring what has been established so far and what is presented with other elements of the world is a rookie writing mistake and a huge problem with season 2 in general.\n\nThe 'useful and capable even without powers' is most evident in the elven ruins scene. Francesca, an elven mage and a respected leader, couldn't read all the ancient elven writing. Yennefer read them on the spot, completely no issue for her. That scene speaks mostly about Yennefer, and while it comes off as showing 'Yen is smart and knows things', it also says 'Francesca knows less than Yen'. Character exposition at the cost of another character _you're also trying to introduce and build up_ is another cheap trick that worked in DBZ.\n\nIn Kaer Morhen, in the last episode, Yennefer is making a potion that's supposed to help against Voleth Meir - paraphrasing, she said _i'm a witch, potions is something i do best and i can do even without my chaos_. The potion is never used or mentioned ever again.\n\nThen there's the whole subplot with Cahir. Yennefer was reluctant to kill to 'prove her innocence', even if it was a confirmed Nilfgaardian baddie. She's not a stone cold killer. That's fair enough, but why did she take Cahir along? She did more than enough freeing him. He's a random dude for her at this point, and one that was involved in sacking of Cintra. He was on the other side at Sodden. Why grab him on a horse with her? The future plot needs Cahir in a specific place, and he needs to be written out of a corner that the writers put him in in the first place by bringing him to Aretuza. But why the in-universe Yennefer cared? The plot of destiny thickens.\n\nBonus: Yennefer lost her power, has no Chaos, is shown to try to cast spells and fails. She can't cast any spells, her power returns only at the very end. Yet she casts the 'hut hut' spell when with Geralt, and they get to the Hut just fine. \n\nBonus #2: Yennefer is a fugitive in ~~Oxenfurt~~ Gors Velen. Doing her best not to be found. She hides her hair and face under a big hood. She really doesn't want to be found and discovered. She wears a bright purple cloak.\n\n**Jaskier**\n\nJaskier's role in season 2 is written in a similar vein and it comes at no surprise he spent a lot of time with Yennefer - his 'elven smuggler' subplot was added to extend his screen time and establish _some_ basis for Yennefer to rescue him later from Rience.\n\nWe first hear of a 'Sandpiper' who helps smuggling elves from Oxenfurt to Cintra. Given he has already earned a monicker, it stands to reason that he's been doing it for a while. Yet we're shown he's having trouble getting through a dock master. Has he always been lucky with no one at the dock during his previous deeds? We're to believe he's had an established smuggling operation, but he was shown winging it and hoping it works. The whole dock scene was there to add some extra tension and introduce a small redemption arc for the unnamed gentleman from the sewers, but it felt flat, with just another disposable side character to use to get out of a corner the writers got the story into.\n\nJaskier's relations with Geralt are at least confusing now. They were developing an actual friendship over season 1, only for it to be discarded by the end - yet Geralt runs to his aid, _all the way to Oxenfurt_, as if he didn't have pressing issues at hand. Why? - other than the need to bring the characters together, which felt forced between them.\n\nThe bard's involvement in Kaer Morhen was equally as odd or worse. He was given a side quest he couldn't complete and that turned out to have no importance anyway - the whole 'special stone' idea was a poorly delivered filler to have Jaskier and Yennefer do _something_. He felt out of place because he was written to reach Kaer Morhen just to 'bring the band together', and the writing didn't deliver on giving him any fleshed out role, not even as character foil to Geralt or a competent sidekick to Yennefer. Sometimes less is more, and skipping something with a decent wave of hand is better than an out-of-place character doing random things or suddenly being incompetent in their supposed strengths.\n\n**Voleth Meir**\n\nI actually liked the general concept for Voleth Meir (going with she/her for simplicity). I wish it was a self-contained subplot with better attention to detail, but hey - it wasn't a bad premise.\n\nSome detail was a wasted opportunity. She's based on Baba Yaga, with the chicken-leg house and all that. She appears as an elderly Ithlinne, as a young girl (young Yen / Ciri), and as... a dude in full armour (implied to be Emhyr). The missed opportunity of her appearing to one of the ladies as an adult woman indicates the writers didn't do their homework or decided to just cherry-pick for no good reason. Appearing as a vision of an adult woman instead of an iron-clad man would fit the 'mother, maiden, and the crone' archetype and give Voleth Meir extra depth. It would also fit the Baba Yaga inspiration more, who is sometimes depicted as three sisters rather than a single person. Taking inspiration and adapting it to a modern audience is absolutely fine - it's great! - but some ideas come as a package deal, if you pick only some elements it feels incomplete.\n\nVoleth Meir is a victim of the idiot plot, too. She's an ancient and powerful entity, she knows what Ciri is, she knows Elder Blood. I get that she wanted to get revenge on witchers for her capture (even if it were completely different witchers), but as she was discovered she still stayed around. She's shown opening a portal to another sphere and drawing out monsters, then just standing there. Why? Why didn't she portal out when yrden weakened and failed, leaving everyone behind with no way to follow her? Why didn't she open a portal for the Wild Hunt to join her but summoned only basilisks? Just a moment later we're shown that Ciri, without Voleth Meir powers, was able to reach Wild Hunt on her own. She could have ported anywhere, keep Ciri as a powerful vessel, and come back for more destruction with her allies. It wasn't possible for her because Good Had To Win, Ciri could not become a permanent vessel to a powerful alien being, all main cast couldn't die - because the overall story requires it, but it lacked good explanation and substance in-universe.\n\nVoleth Meir's specific writing and adding her to the Wild Hunt seems to be directed towards a spin-off. It's nice to be getting more stories told in the Witcher universe, but using the 'main series' to jumpstart spin-offs should be done more carefully, otherwise it hurts the main series itself (everything should make full sense within the series you watch, then be _expanded_ and built upon in other works of the extended universe). Voleth Meir would be great as a self-contained antagonist of the show (written slightly differently to fit it), and not aligning her with the Wild Hunt would help with her idiot plot issues.\n\nIt's entirely possible Voleth Meir is not mentioned in any spin-offs and her involvement with the Wild Hunt is explored in greater depth in the subsequent seasons, making total sense of what we were shown over season 2. I'll eat my words then.\n\n**Ciri**\n\nElder Blood is treated literally. Feainnewedd grows where Ciri's blood was spilled, as she notes about the training course at Kaer Morhen. Are we to believe she never bled during her entire life, sprouting new feainnewedd and making Mousesack or Calanthe suspicious what's happening? Did they notice the odd rare flowers growing here and there around Cintra, but just shrugged it off? After Pavetta's wedding, at least Mousesack would be looking for any signs of magic or oddity from Ciri.\n\n**North and elves**\n\nThe 'Cahir uses get out of jail for free card' scene also suggests the mages are less than thoughtful. We were told there is a spell at the monument site that prevents any use of magic - that's fair. I guess we're supposed to assume they just come in weaponless, powerless, and clueless, meet with monarchs and plan an execution with no backup plan or security put in place. It was enough to escape a site _full of mages and monarchs_ by just knocking over two big braziers and finding a horse, conveniently parked for someone to make a great escape. \n\nAn elf asks Filavandrel how long must they seek Dol Blathanna. Season 1 showed Dol Blathanna in episode 2, along with Filavandrel.\n\nFrancesca and Filavandrel have no one on guard watching their child, first pureblood elf in decades.\n\nAn armed group of elves walks down the street of a human town, a powerful mage casting a spell for mass infanticide, and no one bats an eye. Empty streets, no guards.\n\n**The World**\n\nThere is a [map available on the show's site](https://www.witchernetflix.com/en). Open it and take a look. Find Kaer Morhen, Aretuza, Oxenfurt, and Cintra.\n\nJaskier is smuggling elves from Oxenfurt to Cintra. Is he just shipping them across the sea, not caring about pirates? Passing through Novigrad ports? \n\nYennefer and Ciri take a quick portal from Ellander to a hut near Cintra. The hut was the home of two peasants who helped Ciri back in season one. The hut and the couple are charred, burned to the bone. There's only charcoal and ash, the event must have taken place some time ago, as there are no visible embers. Yet just outside of the hut there are two horses, ready to be taken by our ladies for a trip. Fed, saddled horses. \n\nYennefer and Ciri arrive at the monolith scar near Cintra just as Geralt catches up to them, traveling on horseback, all the way from Ellander. What a fortunate timing.\n\nAfterwards, Geralt tells Jaskier and Yarpen to take Ciri back to Kaer Morhen. _Look at the map_, look at the distance between Cintra and Kaer Morhen. Yarpen and his crew are feisty fighters, but they are not seen at Kaer Morhen afterwards. The secretive keep of witchers that is kept secret, but Yarpen and Jaskier supposedly somehow know where to go. And they don't comment how long will it take.\n\nWhen Francesca, Fringilla and Yennefer arrive at Voleth Meir's hut, we're shown they get there through a passage under a shattered monolith in elven ruins. It must be near Sodden and/or Cintra. When Voleth Meir is freed, she just flies off and possesses Ciri (who is supposedly at Kaer Morhen already or close to it). Yennefer and Geralt make the same distance soon after learning that the hut is empty, and they can't have taken long since they arrive _just in time_ to confront Voleth Meir / Ciri as she's killing off witchers there.\n\nLittlefinger's teleporting device was found on the Continent. Continuity issues like this, completely disregarding the established world to fit it to the plot, are the worst kind of lazy writing.\n\nBonus: Emhyr is another human character that doesn't age between his s1 and s2 portrayals (at least ~15 years).\n\n\n\n\nA good number of these issues can still be explained in subsequent seasons (i have no doubt some will), some of them can be explained with extensive theorycrafting and strong headcanon (which may or may not make sense), but a lot of it is just what's bad about the show.\n\nThere are some absolute purists who keep dwelling on how a character in the show had a wrong hairdo or how their eye colour doesn't match what was in the books, but that's a tiny minority that even other book fans don't take too seriously. The main problem with the show is that it's full of holes, inconsistencies, deus ex machina solutions, cheap tricks, and just bad writing. If it wasn't branded under Witcher franchise and _actually well based on the books where it does follow them_, going just by the original writing we've seen so far it would be just another teenage fantasy drama sitting at 4/10 rating. Conversely, the parts that actually follow the books (even with changes and creative writing) are universally well-received, like s2 e1 with Nivellen.",

Not to mention that she also wants to protect her own baby, who is kind of the future of all elves everywhere.\n\nClearly, she's using her \"friendship\" with Fringilla (and no one can tell me it was genuine - she was just preying on Fringilla's weaknesses and using her for her own gain) throughout her entire stay at Cintra but things get weird when she finally has the baby. She spurns Fringilla, tries to manipulate her against Cahir and says the elves won't be fighting now, cause you know... why should they? - all the while, she's living lavishly in the palace like a queen with everyone taken care of. \n\nWhat did she think would happen from here on out? That Emhyr would just allow her and her people to stay there without having any use of them? They're an expense on the empire's supplies and they refuse to make good on their side of the bargain - did Francesca, a centuries-old (?) powerful sorceress really think he'd be alright with that and just let it pass? I understand why she spurned Fringilla - she's in a tough spot because her alliance with the elves is her only hope at redeeming herself for the failures at Sodden Hill - she couldn't quite tell the elves to pack their things and go. And there was that whole thing with Fringilla thinking they're friends. Perhaps she thought Fringilla could make a good case for her and the elves...\n\nBut was she seriously not worried at all about Emhyr? She was not in a position of power like in the books to demand anything while not moving a finger. I'm simply failing to understand the politics (or lack of) and her logic here. And the writers themselves too.",

Did they fight together? Yes, but it was an extraordinary situation where they needed to join forces to repel a great threat.\n\nAnd in season 2 I suddenly see Tissaia crying and in complete shock at the prospect of Yennefer being dead. I can't help but feel like I missed something, because it makes no sense to me that Yennefer meant THAT much for Tissaia to be literally screaming her name after the battle, and then grieve her loss for what seems to be days.\n\nI can understand that Tissaia would feel some attachment to her students, and Yennefer was one of those. Still, how come she was THAT special? If you could point me some scenes of season 1 I can revisit to have a fresh perspective, I would be glad to do so.",

        "body": ">!After finishing Season 2 I went back and re-watched the whole series from S1E1, and I found a real appreciation for the disjointed timeline. \n\n>!In the opening scenes of Season 1, we get a fairly typical fantasy relationship between a warrior queen and her granddaughter, with Calanthe's bearing being depicted as regal, thoughtful, determined, and this characterization is how viewers carry forward from the sacking of Cintra. By the time we rewatch the sacking of Cintra in S1E7, we've seen some more revealing insights into Calanthe's true nature; we saw her arrogance, her predilection for pettiness and strong-arming, her propensity to lie and deceive, and flat out betrayal. \n\n>!I think the result of that device is that not only do we get a more nuanced and more substantial characterization of Calanthe (and Geralt), but we also get an organic bit of foreshadowing that characters may not be what they seem and that there was a willingness to show and not tell when characters change. We see how how impactful concepts like destiny, the Law of Surprise, curses, and Elder blood are because we were thoughtfully shown the different ways they work on people like Calanthe, Duny, Pavetta and Geralt. \n\n>!After being impressed by that watching season 1, season 2 felt pretty flat by comparison. Many characters that play a significant role of moving their plots forward feel one dimensional; Francesca's stereotypical revenge arc felt contrived, Tissaia's maternal affection for Yen felt heavy-handed and like a teen drama, Yen's relationship with Ciri was not only forced to the point of being nonsensical but Yen and Geralt both take on pretty childish, one dimensional personalities for the bulk of the season. The type of emotional gravity we got from Calanthe's banquet is replaced by cheap tropes (killing Roach, killing babies, centuries old men bullying a little girl, Yen losing her magic) that make everything happening feel low stakes and irrelevant. \n\n>!I know this is a pretty popular criticism of the season, but having Eskel, Vesemir, and a whole cabal of witchers be damn near undistinguishable from random roadmen really underscored just how little attention was paid to real characterization and building believable relationships with gravity, substance, and that really makes me fear for Season 3, a season that's going to have a lot of moving parts which require depth to feel like they *matter*.",

        "body": "This is attempt of balanced critique from my perspective ( a fan of this show ) - not a rant.\n\nSo they've turned Fringilla into important character in this show, and it would be fine if she actualy said something substantial from time to time. \n\nWhen Fringilla is saying something, it's usualy ( not always ) repetitive and not interesting at all. They wrote her as this sort of exposition character for the \" bad guys \" , but gave her so many scenes, it doesn't work as a whole concept. The idea was there, but writing is staying behind and we can see it falling apart every time she's on the screen. \n\nFringilla actress ( Mimi Ndiweni ) isn't that great either, and she has maybe three face expressions in total. If I contradict this with Freya Allan  - who isn't great actress either, shes an OK actress - well, Freya does something with her face even without any lines. She can change face expression seven times during one dialogue scene and I admire that A LOT.  But Mimi Ndiweni as Fringilla Vigo ? \" we, the Nilfgaard will do something yada yada yada, the chaos, the white flame... \" aaaand... she smiles.\n\nCombination of repetitive lines and her robotic face with very little face expression, makes Fringilla one of the most boring characters in the entire show. Everyone involved should try harder next time.",

        "body": "I’d like to preface this by saying that my only prior experience to Witcher has been the little bit that I played of Witcher 3 and even that I dropped because of work commitments.\n\nI have not read the books, so if you’re a book purist, you will probably not agree with most or all of what I have to say about the new season.\n\nThat said, the first season of The Witcher was really enjoyable and I particularly liked how they wove together disparate timelines and left it to me as the viewer to infer the agelessness and long-term involvement of certain characters. That made it feel like the characters had a life outside of what was being shown in the episodes. But the first season also lacked a certain level of polish and it reminded me a lot of the first seasons of The Office and Parks and Recreation, in that the show runners were figuring out what worked for them and what didn’t.\n\nComing to the second season, from start to finish, I loved every episode. I do wish some of the dialog was better and we’d seen Jaskier a little bit earlier and we had more songs from him. But these are nitpicks and didn’t detract too much for me from the overall experience.\n\nThe interweaving plot lines with Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer, the elves, the mages of Aretuza, Dijkstra, and Voleth Meir worked really well for me.\n\nThe Witcher homegrounds, Kaer Morhen, didn’t work as well for me and fell flat.\n\nYarpen’s appearance was pretty awesome but after reading someone else’s comment on here, I was left wondering what happened to the dwarf party when Geralt and Yennefer high tailed it back to Kaer Morhen.\n\nOverall, I really liked this season. Especially the soundtrack and all the scenes with Voleth Meir gave me the tingles. I understand the complaints from those more familiar with the lore but it worked for me. :)\n\nThanks for reading",

Sounds so ridiculous... she literally burned down half of Nilfgaardian army but its not enough? They are like: Nah all those thousands of dead enemies are not enough, you need to kill one more person, and this one more will prove you are innocent?\n\nAnd also, Yen doesn't want to do it, because it will prove she's a \"killer\" and Stregobor will vilify her? Lady what? You already killed so many just in that one fire scene alone, how does 1 more person makes a difference?  If Stregobor wants to vilify you he can use the \"forbidden fire magic/burning whole field of enemies\" angle rather than accusing her of killing one prisoner.\n\nAlso than also, she doesn't want to admit she lost her magic, which is the only reason she was able to be captured so easily and the reason she was missing for a month, which  would further prove her innocence and sacrifice, but she is hiding that?\n\nPlease someone makes this all make sense to me.",

Seen some YouTube clips of TW3 other redditors referenced once about a lubberkin or something. Anyway yeah... I really like the show, it's about as good of a fantasy show I could ask for really. Interesting world, lots of plots happening and coming together in cool ways. Good action but it doesn't lean on it too much. Im sure if I did read the books I'd be pissed about some things but I'm very much enjoying it.  Feels like a movie quality production the whole way through.

That would be yet another (partial) deviation from the books but I don't mind it tbf \n\n2) If indeed he doesn't work for him, then why/how did Vilgy get his ass kicked by Cahir ? What purpose did that serve ? And how is he supposed to be shown as many times more powerful than Rience if he got beaten fair and square by a simpleton soldier ? \n\n3) I feel like the writers are leaning towards him being almost like a Littlefinger character, a weakish but very smart character, but they would probably be suicidal to deny the many badass fights that happen with him in the books. So I feel like his magical prowess might come from him getting his hands on Ciri first, and using her powers in some way ? \nAm I alone in thinking that they might struggle with solving the whole mess that came from that ridiculous Cahir v Vilgefortz duel? \n\nJust overall, please share your feelings on the character and what you think/hope we will see from him in S3 !",

        "body": "Yeah, the sword wielder should probably live up to his blade, but weapons provide so much room for exploration in fantasy, a genre where it often seems “your” idea has already been thought of (*glares at Brandon Sanderson*).\n\nWeapons are a force. They are tools for the character using them. But more than that, they can be characters in and of themselves, or such integral parts of that character that separating the two would be impossible. What would Geralt of Rivia be without his swords? Who would Kaladin Stormblessed be if his spear was taken from him?\n\nThose weapons become icons to know the character by, and vessels for parts of that character’s personality. When you can’t tell blade from man, which one is actually killing?\n\nBut when the weapon takes on a life of its own, then you can start to explore avenues of storytelling not seen before.\n\nThe Crucible wielded by the one, the only, Doom Slayer, is utterly unique. It’s a broadsword lightsaber made of the essence of destroyed demons. Who else has done that? \n\nWhat about Drach’nyen, a blade composed of an actual daemon formed from the first murder, that strikes down kings and demi-gods like nothing? Or Nightblood, a sword made to destroy evil with no concept of what evil is.\n\nThis is where weapons come into their own, and why magic swords should be everywhere! The only way to roll.",

        "title": "A critique of The Witcher: Season 2 (mainly)",
        "body": "Spoilers for Season 2 ahead. Books will be mentioned.  \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAs many here, I love The Witcher. I dive nose deep into everything regarding the universe. I've played the games, I've seen the polish movie. I've read the books several times. By now it's something I do on a yearly basis.  \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nI would like to preface everything, with saying that I did enjoy many themes and parts of this season, and found the special effects to be stunning, much better than last season (the monsters were gorgeous). Acting was better on everyone's part, Anya and Freya did a really good job with what they were offered (Joey still king, although I hope Jaskier will be more than simple comedic relief). Overall there were many things I enjoyed. There are however some issues (**especially** the finale), which made me write this.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nReading this introduction, many will assume that I'm yet another book lover that likes no change at all. A person that notices a secondary character with a slightly different hue of hair than imagined, and gets mad about it (not that people like that exist, for the record). I would like to think that despite being a book purist that is not the case. Like many others I do not mind when something is added to the show. I welcome creativity with open arms, even when I do not necessarily like it, I can understand the steps taken, and even appreciate the effort. The fact that the books can't be translated one to one is not lost on me, and I don't expect this to be a 1 to 1 adaptation (even if I would like it to be). Do I dislike some of the changes, even minor ones? Hell yeah I do, but they don't truly change my enjoyment of the show, so why should I bother? Ciri accompanying Geralt in the 1st episode or the different personalities of some characters (Vesemir, for one - I would rather have the book version) were understandable in the context of the show and I liked it for what it was. \nTo be exact, I didn’t dislike things which were added to the show but did not appear in the books, I even found them refreshing at times. Explanation of Rience’s wound, Yen’s backstory, „The Sandpiper“, these were nice additions added throughout the show which enhanced the story. What I disliked were the unnecessary changes to some established plots which completely change the flow of the show, and relationships of the characters. Yes Brokilon, I’m looking at you. Season 1 doesn’t do a good job on building the relationship between Geralt and Ciri, however I was hopeful they would fix it in the second season. Which they did, to a certain extent.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nNow about my issues with the second season. A lot of the themes in this show are changed for no apparent reason, any room to interpretation and allowing us the viewer to figure things out on their own is just killed on the spot. The first thing which irked me in this show was the ending of the first episode, and Geralt dealing with Nivellen by basically telling him he can go and kill himself. I had to rewatch that scene to make sure I was not misunderstanding. The beauty of the Witcher books is allowing the person reading them to figure things out for themselves, and that's the case with Nivellen’s story in books as well. We were left with Geralt carrying him away, telling changed Nivellen they'll talk when they sit down somewhere quieter. That's it. What does changing that exactly do? It changes a rather thought inducing, issue provoking moment to something outright simple and flat. A desperate man struggling with his emotions? Was that message not clear already? But it gets even worse. Flat-out oversimplification and removing mysteries is rampant this season. One could argue it’s due to the nature of it being a TV series, and I would partially agree.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nLet's get an easy issue out of the way. Ciri shouting to use magic? Really? In the moment, if it happens once, twice, makes sense, right. I am very well aware of her power being unstable and very powerful, choosing a scream to let her powers out is not necessarily the issue. The frequency at which this is used doesn’t sit well with me. If you have a „strong emotional moment“ each episode – are they really that strong when they happen so often? By the end of the show I was feeling like this was Skyrim, not Witcher.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nRegarding that - magic. Oh boy. The only time so far a *source* has been mentioned was during the conversation about the fire magic more or less. Ciri has great power, sure, but that obviously doesn't mean she can control it. The books portrayed the process of Ciri learning magic as quite slow and meticulous, similar to the one we've seen at Aretuza. Yennefer required her to be patient. She was her magic tutor. Instead, what we got is basically a purple-eyed Shia LaBeouf screaming „JUST DO IT“. Was that really „teaching“? Yes, the system doesn't need to be the same as the books one (even though there is **really**  no reason for it not to be introduced, that way we can see the dangers of fire magic first hand). For people who read the books too:>!Yennefer losing her abilities due to fire magic truly reminded me of Ciri in the books. It feels stupid to me, but if they go through with it happening to Ciri I would actually be okay with it.!<\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn the end, the book's main theme is family and the bonds within. It seems Lauren would agree with that. So building these bonds would surely be important to convey this theme. That connects to season 1, as the Brokilon episode quite frankly screwed up a big part of the relationship between Geralt and Ciri, as a big part of their bond was built in that forest. In addition, making Ciri older (for exactly what reason? Books spoilers:>!I am aware of Bonhart, Mistle and the problems which could arise from Ciri being younger, but there are many easy solutions to this, making a bigger time-gap, smart writing, or just keeping it the way it is, and dealing with it maturely.!<). Instead, it feels like making Ciri older caused more problems with the believability of her relationship with Geralt. This especially impacted the finale of S1. In the show her relationship with Geralt is much flatter, and less believable than in the books - but at least it feels that it's there, distorted but it exists, despite us being reminded that *Geralt is there to protect her* every third sentence so we do not forget about it. Maybe it is some sort of an inside joke I'm too dumb to understand. Yet, it does not feel like Geralt fulfills the role of a father. He's her mentor, *protector* - as he loves to point out. Ciri herself said this season, that Geralt  feels like the father she never had. These words lack believability. In the end, Geralt gave her a sword, and protected her from dangers, that’s all. By the way, using Ciri as a bait was absolutely stupid and unnecessary. Less than perfect means death, right?\nYennefer's writing. I could ignore (and I will) half of the issues with her character and how they make no sense whatsoever, and I could still write a post rivaling the Bible in length. In the books Yennefer is around 100 years old. She did everything she could during that time. She fucked everyone she wanted, she used her power for anything she wanted. The one thing she could not have with all that power and time was a child. We see an experienced, strong woman with convictions - acting towards her goals. She's dignified, majestic, with her less “pretty” side shown tastefully to us aswell. Now, in the show do we see that? We see quite literally someone acting as reasonable as a teenager. Yes, emotions are at play. You would think that regardless of that someone around 70 years old in the show would show a tiny bit more sense in her actions. But I guess her just throwing around a “fuck” and “shit” every second sentence is a testament to her…. What exactly? Firefucker? Seriously? Is she trying to take the spot from Jaskier? \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nNow, about the second-to-worst matter. Yennefer's relationship with Ciri. Big bullshit. There is absolutely nothing connecting them in the show at all. Geralt connects them, really? She developed a better relationship with fucking Jaskier than she did with Ciri. And the best part - Ciri-Yen was developed badly. REALLY, REALLY badly. The writers literally wrote themselves into a hole, and I have no idea how they will deal with this. There is no essence to their relationship. Yennefer's inability to wield magic turned her into a motivational coach rather than Ciri’s teacher. They could have withheld with many of the decisions in this season. Now, I don't think we're going to get the absolutely fucking beautiful scene from the books, of Yennefer teaching Ciri magic, with her scathing yet endearing remarks. A connection between them does not exist. Yet we are supposed to believe Yennefer would give her life for Ciri? For exactly what reason? All of this accompanied by weird writing choices, and her (THE CHARACTER) acting like she's 20 make her arc a complete mess with barely any development.  Geralt and Yennefer’s common goal is protecting Ciri. I wonder how the *fuck* that will be accomplished without being artificially put into the story, after Yen tried to sacrifice her. Yennefer’s character feels like a lost cause.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nFinally, the reason I'm writing the post. Now, when everyone was getting Thanos'd inside of Ciri's head, yet *he* wasn't - I thought that was a really cool nod. I was about to be like \"Hey, this episode isn't *that* bad, that’s a nice detail to leave in!\". And then I saw them walking with Emhyr. \"**They won't do it, they don't have the balls, right?**\".  \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThey say hope dies last, and I felt it wilt before my very own eyes. I have to say, kudos. Kudos, for surprising me with that scene, because I wasn't ready. Despite already knowing the story.  \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTo me, half of the show's worth was just lost with that reveal. Can you imagine if Jon Snow’s parentage was spoiled to the viewer in S2? I was very well aware the writers were taking away any mysteries away from this show, and explaining everything to the bone. But this is too much. It really feels like this show is ripping away all the traits which make The Witcher.... The Witcher. An adaptation is like following a cooking recipe. What this show has done was almost like taking a delicious meal, and blending it into a smoothie, hoping it will retain the flavor.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIt's not about the monsters, or the epicness. It's always about the journey. Connecting facts. If that's taken away from us, what do we really have left? Fighting monsters, with no bigger purpose behind that, as we already know all we need. That is not why I love The Witcher. Not why I recommend it to everyone I know. It feels tragic, seeing an amazing, unique story with a vast universe, with a cast great cast, slowly losing its potential in exchange for a few seconds worth of a cliffhanger.   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTo everyone who enjoyed the show - I'm glad you did. I truly wonder, how the show's finale will be perceived with the trajectory it's currently taking. I wish I could be optimistic. \n\n\n\nTo a better season 3.",

The elves also say that they deliberately destroyed some of the Aretuza-places and monuments to keep them out of humans' hands, which means they probably have far more power than we currently understand. The history between elves and humans also seems to be wrong, as in not correct, especially given the reveal of the lost book in the shop/at Ellis and Fenn's shop.\n\n**Vilgefortz is working for Nilfgaard, Lydia is working for Dijkstra, Dijkstra is working for V**.  During s2e7, Dijkstra says that Tissaia hasn't told V that Ciri is alive; why would he know what V knows unless they're working together? Lydia, before sniffing the witcher mutagen, says a line about \"the theatrics and distraction\" being part of her boss's plan, and Dijk had earlier said the same line about \"theatrics and distraction\" while revealing an assassination plot to his king. At the end of s1, V killed a mage on the side of the Continent, and he also lied to get Yen to come to Aretuza so he could pull her into going to Sodden, to be killed. He also seemed to be deliberately losing to Cahir, burning through his magic super fast. It may be that he wasn't for Nilfgaard until after he lost to Cahir, but he was certainly on his own side before that. Tissaia probably knows V is a spy and is trying to gain info from him through their relationship.\n\n**Francesca is the mutant elf from Nightmare of the Wolf**. It was said that all the elf sorcerers had died out, but the mutant would have powers, and it  makes sense that she would be the one they turn to after Filavandrel, because he's also who raised her. Her being the mutant would explain why she can't have kids.\n\n**Yen is Falka's kid, or she's related not to an elf but to a monster, a witcher, or something else**. Falka is mentioned and Istredd explicitly asks Stregebor if he thinks Yen is another Falka. We see no one else who's physically maimed due to having elf blood, so it could be that she's not elven at all but has the same magic that the monsters do. Both could be true, if her father was unknown and her mother is the one who carried Falka's line. Maybe Falka's curse is why Yen was crippled.  \n\n**Calanthe&co knew that Emyr was alive the whole time and that he was Nilfgaard's emperor**. At the banquet in the first episode of s1 they said, “if cintra falls your granddaughter will rule”, which would only happen if they knew the attackers' gameplan. So they knew it’s him. I think they lied to Ciri about the deaths because Calanthe tried to kill Emyr when Pavetta and Emyr left to go retake his throne, but she only successfully killed Pavetta. So she couldn't say anything without admitting she was the one who caused P's death. That's why Emyr wants to kill Calanthe.

        "body": "I just binged the entire second season of the Witcher yesterday, having waited until after Christmas when I could sit down and enjoy it. I plan to watch it again, but these are my impressions after a first watch. Also bear in mind my sole experience with the material is limited to the series and the Witcher 3 game, so I have no commentary on how they changed anything from the books.\n\nIn overview, I was amazed by season 2 and felt the show seriously upped the bar. The complexity I saw was reminiscent of Game of Thrones in its early (read: better) seasons, and it made me hungry for a lot more. This season was worth the wait. I hope we don't have to wait nearly as long for season 3.\n\nIt's easiest to organize this review in terms of how season 2 differed from season 1. Season 1 was of course very episodic in nature, with three interspersed timelines meeting up as the series neared the end, rather than a single timeline. Its narrative and cast were much smaller, whereas season 2 felt like it encompassed the entire Continent (and more besides) and had serious meat to its story. Obviously this is all in part due to season 1 being based more on the short stories.\n\nWhereas season 1 demanded some attention from the viewer with its timelines, season 2 was more demanding in terms of the story itself. On the balance I think the new season was more complex, but in my opinion this was all for the better; it made the world feel more real. I didn't find the expanded scope of the story and its vastly expanded cast of characters at all overwhelming.\n\nA couple of words should be spared for my joy in the returning characters. Triss Merigold was treated as a solid part of the story this time around instead of an afterthought, and I was glad her hair was actually red now. A few surprises like >!Yarpin!< were warmly welcome, and provided great levity as the story grew heavier. And it was so good to see >!Dara!< again, taking on a more significant role in things to come and hinting at some future tough decisions to be made.\n\nThe fluidity of characters' alliances was something I found thoroughly enjoyable, even if a casual viewer might get lost thinking: \"Wait, wasn't she on his side two episodes ago?\" Many of the new characters were ciphers, and for some returning ones like Cahir and Fringilla we saw more of their motivations and how they perceived Nilfgaard, all in stark opposition to season 1 where Nilfgaard was a nebulous, dark evil. (Nilfgaard is still brutal and messed up, though. Just because Fringilla sees them as liberators doesn't mean she's right.) Dijkstra was a delight on the screen, so I greatly hope we see more of him in season 3. And the psychopathic Rience left plenty of questions—foremost, why he would choose to >!stay involved instead of walking away once he was out of prison!<. For everyone else there was a lot of who's-screwing-whom, figuratively and otherwise, and I loved that for the most part we didn't get those answers yet.\n\nAnd the answers we did get were satisfying. No, it still isn't clear why >!Vilgefortz bashed another mage's head in!< at the end of season 1, but there does appear to be a deeper agenda and it's still only a tease. The reveals about Ciri were gradual and told us a lot, yet held quite a lot in reserve. And one of the biggest of all, why >!Nilfgaard was after her in the first place!<, was saved for the very end. (Even *then* it's clear there must be more to it than that.) Stregobor's reluctance to install Yennefer in Aedirn in season 1 makes way more sense now in the context that he's had a very, very bad history with elven-blood mages and he can't escape his fear; yes he's a racist, but above all else Stregobor is clearly a wounded man ruled by the scars of his past and a fear of history repeating.\n\nOne of the things I really enjoyed was that the main plot arc was tied to something I took for a throwaway event in season 1. The writers used the opportunity that provided to delve deeper into the history of the world and unfold more of it. The Wild Hunt was teased more, treated as more than just a throwaway line or two as they were in season 1 and setting them up as a greater-context threat for seasons to come. Although the history of men and elves was a major arc to the season, the Conjunction of the Spheres that began it all was explored more as well, so the multiverse of the setting feels more real than it did before.\n\nThematically season 2 was absolutely dripping with meaning. Destiny was the iron-fisted ruler of season 1; but in season 2, there are hints that there may be another side to that coin, and finding it may be crucial for Ciri's future. It isn't at all clear yet if she has a choice in where this is going; but if she does, she's going to have to work for it. The merciless persecution of the elves, and their reactionary distrust of *all* humans as a result, is felt throughout the new season. That dovetailed beautifully with a theme that in a world of questionable choices, it's all the more important to do the right thing whenever possible. Geralt knows a truth Stregobor does not: \"We do not kill out of fear.\"\n\nThe last episode of the season ties a lot of the arcs together in a neat package, leaving so many threads to pull at but no sense at all that the writers simply forgot about so-and-so. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, and they don't feel ignored. Things are moving, not only on the Continent but across worlds, and the story has a long way to go from here. Indeed there are hints at new or growing threats that were only at the fringes in the first two seasons. At last we see the wider world I came to love from the game: sprawling and full of overlapping designs.\n\nSo those are my two cents. Well done to the writers for managing so many characters and agendas at once, and I'm looking forward to seeing where the series goes from here.",

Stregobor's reluctance to install Yennefer in Aedirn in season 1 makes way more sense now in the context that he's had a very, very bad history with elven-blood mages and he can't escape his fear; yes he's a racist, but above all else Stregobor is clearly a wounded man ruled by the scars of his past and a fear of history repeating.\n\nOne of the things I really enjoyed was that the main plot arc was tied to something I took for a throwaway event in season 1. The writers used the opportunity that provided to delve deeper into the history of the world and unfold more of it. The Wild Hunt was teased more, treated as more than just a throwaway line or two as they were in season 1 and setting them up as a greater-context threat for seasons to come. Although the history of men and elves was a major arc to the season, the Conjunction of the Spheres that began it all was explored more as well, so the multiverse of the setting feels more real than it did before.\n\nThematically season 2 was absolutely dripping with meaning. Destiny was the iron-fisted ruler of season 1; but in season 2, there are hints that there may be another side to that coin, and finding it may be crucial for Ciri's future. It isn't at all clear yet if she has a choice in where this is going; but if she does, she's going to have to work for it. The merciless persecution of the elves, and their reactionary distrust of *all* humans as a result, is felt throughout the new season. That dovetailed beautifully with a theme that in a world of questionable choices, it's all the more important to do the right thing whenever possible. Geralt knows a truth Stregobor does not: \"We do not kill out of fear.\"\n\nThe last episode of the season ties a lot of the arcs together in a neat package, leaving so many threads to pull at but no sense at all that the writers simply forgot about so-and-so. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, and they don't feel ignored. Things are moving, not only on the Continent but across worlds, and the story has a long way to go from here. Indeed there are hints at new or growing threats that were only at the fringes in the first two seasons. At last we see the wider world I came to love from the game: sprawling and full of overlapping designs.\n\nSo those are my two cents. Well done to the writers for managing so many characters and agendas at once, and I'm looking forward to seeing where the series goes from here.",

        "body": "I just binged the entire second season of the Witcher yesterday, having waited until after Christmas when I could sit down and enjoy it. I plan to watch it again, but these are my impressions after a first watch. Also bear in mind my sole experience with the material is limited to the series and the Witcher 3 game, so I have no commentary on how they changed anything from the books.\n\nIn overview, I was amazed by season 2 and felt the show seriously upped the bar. The complexity I saw was reminiscent of Game of Thrones in its early (read: better) seasons, and it made me hungry for a lot more. This season was worth the wait. I hope we don't have to wait nearly as long for season 3.\n\nIt's easiest to organize this review in terms of how season 2 differed from season 1. Season 1 was of course very episodic in nature, with three interspersed timelines meeting up as the series neared the end, rather than a single timeline. Its narrative and cast were much smaller, whereas season 2 felt like it encompassed the entire Continent (and more besides) and had serious meat to its story. Obviously this is all in part due to season 1 being based more on the short stories.\n\nWhereas season 1 demanded some attention from the viewer with its timelines, season 2 was more demanding in terms of the story itself. On the balance I think the new season was more complex, but in my opinion this was all for the better; it made the world feel more real. I didn't find the expanded scope of the story and its vastly expanded cast of characters at all overwhelming.\n\nA couple of words should be spared for my joy in the returning characters. Triss Merigold was treated as a solid part of the story this time around instead of an afterthought, and I was glad her hair was actually red now. A few surprises like >!Yarpin!< were warmly welcome, and provided great levity as the story grew heavier. And it was so good to see >!Dara!< again, taking on a more significant role in things to come and hinting at some future tough decisions to be made.\n\nThe fluidity of characters' alliances was something I found thoroughly enjoyable, even if a casual viewer might get lost thinking: \"Wait, wasn't she on his side two episodes ago?\" Many of the new characters were ciphers, and for some returning ones like Cahir and Fringilla we saw more of their motivations and how they perceived Nilfgaard, all in stark opposition to season 1 where Nilfgaard was a nebulous, dark evil. (Nilfgaard is still brutal and messed up, though. Just because Fringilla sees them as liberators doesn't mean she's right.) Dijkstra was a delight on the screen, so I greatly hope we see more of him in season 3. And the psychopathic Rience left plenty of questions—foremost, why he would choose to >!stay involved instead of walking away once he was out of prison!<. For everyone else there was a lot of who's-screwing-whom, figuratively and otherwise, and I loved that for the most part we didn't get those answers yet.\n\nAnd the answers we did get were satisfying. No, it still isn't clear why >!Vilgefortz bashed another mage's head in!< at the end of season 1, but there does appear to be a deeper agenda and it's still only a tease. The reveals about Ciri were gradual and told us a lot, yet held quite a lot in reserve. And one of the biggest of all, why >!Nilfgaard was after her in the first place!<, was saved for the very end.

(besides her showing some potential of being a sorceress)\n- Does Yennefer get any bet but it's never shown.\n- Were the three apprentices sacrificed? Why does it Yennefer not bother or make her scared for her life? Were those the three best or worst witches?\n- Why is she so obsessed with being at one court/kingdom instead the other? Her actions seem to be drastic for just wanting to be back at home (where she doesn't have family or friends I assume)\n\n\nThe others are better but in general the series is doing a very poor job to introduce any character or their motivation. Why is Geralt fixed on money or helping others when they don't want his help? Why does he visit a brothel when he doesn't even have the money for it? \n\nWhy is Ciri fleeing from Nilfgaard? I didn't pick up any clues that they would do something bad to her? (spoiler? from the game upcoming) And with her being the future emperor of Nilfgaard we all know they wouldn't harm here anyway. Why does nobody know that she's the daughter of Emhyr var Emreis?",

It was just funny to me how she opened with \"don't you just LOVE it\", (yes, quoting her) and after we talked for a while she ended up telling me several things she didn't understand, thought were kinda dumb, and stuff she really disliked.\n\nWe agree that visually it looks really good. She likes just about all the acting... She thinks the relationship between Yen & Ciri still works and they'll get past the scheme from this season (eeeehhh). She thinks Triss is a really good character. She *loves* Joey Batey. She thinks the show moves along quickly and is really exciting. She's not a book reader, so had no such expectations.\n\nBut...\n\nShe disliked a fair amount of the last episode. She wondered why the other witchers were so useless. She didn't understand why Yen's sacrifice forced the deathless mother to her. She didn't like the transformation into the wild hunt. She thought the motivation to return home was underwhelming for a plan that was a little convoluted.\n\nShe thought the fringilla/cahir/elves plot seemed dumb and destined to fail.  She didn't get why Yen saved Cahir to begin with. But, she thought Fringilla's poison scene was badass and helped her character - so that's a plus.\n\nWhile she loves Jaskier, she hated his hair/wig? I dunno, I truly didn't even notice, but man she went on about that for a minute.\n\nShe was confused about the politics, because she didn't know what the other kings were doing. The meeting tissaia had with them made no sense to her. Djikstra was just the guy that talked to a bird who just changed into a woman for some reason (she had me rolling on this). She doesn't understand why emhyr wants ciri (I told her I wouldn't spoil it, but his reason is kinda fucked)\n\nShe sees nilfgaard as pretty clearly bad when I said the books do a good job of making everything morally gray. She liked rience but thought there wasn't enough tantalizing info about who he's working for & why he was trying to get Ciri. I just mentioned that there's another twist coming about behind the scenes stuff.\n\nShe was really unclear about understanding why Vesemir was trying to turn Ciri into a Witcher. She thought Eskel was pretty much a throwaway character. She laughed about the feeding him to the wolves part.\n\nShe liked episode 1, but saw it as just a good beauty and the beast ripoff.\n\nAll to say, I don't think there's many people who unabashedly love the show, not utterly hate every second of it. We're likely all a lot closer to the middle than we think.",

        "body": "I wonder who else got interested in the series as a result of post-GOT fatigue and the desire to see a new and more interesting fantasy show on another platform, and one made by a woman showrunner (Lauren Schmidt Hissrich) nonetheless, and see how it differs from the David Benioff and DB Weiss-run GoT.\n\nOne thing that's been intriguing to me that despite having the woman showrunner, **The Witcher** did not do the \"Strong Female Lead\" angle that is commonly expected from Hollywood. Its women cast are given few of the grand \"soundbites\" that GoT became notorious for among its \"strong female leads\" like \"When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.\" or \"All men must die, but we are not men!\" etc., along with much less of an angle about \"surviving in a man's world\" that GoT was known for as well. \n\nSo far (I am at S2E3) and so far there is no equivalent of a cunning Cersei, a girlbossy Daenerys, or a swashbuckling Arya that I can recall (there is a Renfri but she dies fast). The single most \"powerful\" character front and centre is Geralt by far, as in in terms of the control he exerts over every situation. You rarely see Yennefer, Tissaia, Fringilla and Ciri comment about their relationships with MEN or have to topple MEN to do so. In fact the show seems to see nothing wrong with some of their subservience to men, like Fringilla whose die-hard loyalty to Emhyr seems well-founded, and Yennefer, whose rise from ostracised hunchback to powerful sorceress has rarely involved upstaging a man in particular either. In fact, many women do make sacrifices for men they love even if the latter may not deserve it, like Vereena for Nivellen in S2E1, at their own expense, whereas I don't recall many such instances in GoT at all. The way Hissrich goes about having a \"strong\" female presence is to really let the women's decisions drive the story much more than the men's without the women having to be \"powerful\", so that the women become more memorable than the men over the long run. \n\nIt's a subtle and not easily noticeable trend given the show being ostensibly about Geralt. It's kind of a neat twist: Geralt is used for action sequences in the show the way it seems, a woman in a traditional male-oriented show would be used for love scenes: to get plenty of them, and often. And funny enough, this approach pleases both male and female audiences, and hasn't made the show attract much controversy or talk. (Maybe men are that simple after all...)\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Jaskier turned the adventure into a song but added him getting with those women, and the big guy called him out on it.  😂🤣",

Even then it's not a 100% clear what's even happening or why I should care. Something something elves, nilfgard, northland's but also yennifer and sometimes Witcher and circi, but none of it feels like it's connecting or going anywhere.

        "body": "There were **so** many good moments between them that we FINALLY got treated to! I can't really chose one for myself, but two of them stick out to me.\n\nThe first is at the end of 2x01 when they have that talk by the campfire, and Geralt says he won't let anything happen to her. Ciri's little smile after hearing him say that was so endearing. It's the start of their trust and father-daughter bond taking form, and the fact that Henry Cavill and Freya improvised that scene makes it even more heartwarming. \n\nI also really was moved by the scene in 2x05 when Geralt stops Ciri from taking the Trial of the Grasses. Then she tells him \"No matter how hard I train, it'll never be enough,\" and he responds with \"You are already enough. You are extraordinary,\" my heart grew three sizes like the fricking Grinch! (lol). Then she adds \"I want to be like you.\" GAH, so cute but also so revealing of character development. \n\nHonorable mention has to go out to the \"mine\" scene as well when Geralt holds his sword to Yen's neck! He really loves his kiddo!  \n\nI'm curious to hear what are some of everyone's favorite scenes, exchanges, or moments between Ciri and Geralt as well! There were so many, and honestly seeing how great of a father Geralt is becoming was amazing. Can't wait for more! Maybe next season we'll get that snowball fight?!",

        "body": "I played and beat Witcher 3 years ago and loved it. I beat the main game and hearts of the stone at the time but never got to Blood and Wine until this week. I quickly beat the main storyline of Blood and Wine and many side quests. I really liked The Witcher season 1 but I did have issues with it, I gave them benefit of the doubt because assumed they were trying to make everything make sense with the books. I was still very excited for season 2. I finished The Witcher season 2 with mixed but mostly negative opinions. However, after a few weeks to digest it I have now lost faith in the show and the showrunner.\n\nWitcher 3 story and side quests pack far more emotion and character than the TV show. Isn't it supposed to be the opposite? It's a video game vs. a real TV show. I actually teared up at the end of the Blood and Wine main story line at the happy ending I got. The Bloody Baron, The Last Wish, Uma/Avallac'h, Ciri reunion, the Crones, Orianna, Towerful of Mice, and many more. The Hearts of Stone story was incredible, Gaunter O'Dimm was one of the best antagonists I have ever seen in anything. There are really so many main story and sidequests in Witcher 3 that are so much more well WRITTEN than anything in the TV show. After I finished season 2 I thought ok, they must've really tried to hug the books, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt again. But after reading this sub for a few days I learned most of the crap in the show wasn't even in the books. Like this entire Elf/Nilfgaard/Cintra dynamic for example. The show just feels more like complicated political mess than a thoughtful and provocative story about a Witcher and prodigious child. To placate the viewer from watching a lot of talking and confusing politics they have Geralt use Ciri as bait to kill a monster, flying through the air from off-screen, with his sword in two seconds flat.  First of all how irresponsible and out of character is it for Geralt to use Ciri as bait for anything? That's so dangerous and ridiculous. Then he calls Ciri brave. Ciri isn't brave for standing still while a monster, especially a monster unfamiliar to Geralt, charges at her without flinching she's just foolishly and blindly listening to some Witcher who doesn't seem to understand the danger of the situation and doesn’t understand to expect the unexpected. You know, witchers can make bait for monsters out of like herbs and meat and stuff, it's done a lot in the game. Trying this is probably wiser.  He even unnecessarily gets Roach killed. I kept thinking to myself while I was watching them prepare for the monster, get rid of the horse, get rid of the horse, get rid of the horse. I'm not a witcher, I'm just some guy and I knew to do this. If I know to do this the witcher should know to do this. He didn't get rid of horse and so it died. \n\nSpeaking of out of chacter what the hell has the show done to Vesemir? In the game and allegedly the books (I did not read the books but have heard) Vesemir is very wise, experienced, composed, and a father figure to all the Witchers. He is the one who knows the most answers and Geralt listens to him and takes instructions from him. The show makes him seem like a pretty old, confused, and irresponsible guy. How can he think to give Ciri Witcher mutagens? Especially without consulting Geralt? Geralt luckily catches him before he was able to do this and he just shamefully puts his head down like he knew what he was doing was wrong, and Geralt is his daddy scolding him. This is an unimaginable, impossible scene to anyone who played Witcher 3. \n\nThe shows best attempt this season at an emotional plotline was this demon thing they did in the last episode. It really was quite boring and felt like a bad 80's horror movie or a budget poltergeist or something. How cliche was Geralt? \"You can do it Ciri\", \"we need you Ciri\". Such garbage, like we've never seen that before. It was out of character on top of it all. Geralt and Vesemir knew exactly what the demon was but didn't know it had no place to go? Halfway through it is Yennefer who recognizes this so they have been just wasting time? How does she know that instead of them, the Witchers, the monster/demon experts whose group was responsible for sealing it? Oh my god then Vesemir stabs Ciri. That was the low point of the whole series I feel. When Vesemir just shivs Ciri. I cringed at that. Like what the fuck? Lol.\n\nAnd wow the casting. I thought Yennefer was okay in season 1 but in season 2 idk her age difference with Cavil really became apparent. I actually think Henry is doing a great job and was casted perfectly but he is 38 and this actress is 25. It's just weird and wasn't necessary for this show.  Would it really have killed the casting directors to hire a 30+ year old? I really feel like this was an unforced error. Even this would be easier to watch if their relationship with written with any talent and emotion. The Last Wish questline in the game with Yennefer was so good and EMOTIONAL. Nothing in this show is registering with me whatsoever with these two. And this Triss? This Triss??? They dyed her hair red in the second season as fanservice I feel. I know that its 2022 now and we all have to be woke and we all have to be inclusive but when you cast every single part in a show a person of a different ethnic background, even characters from the same region, there is something inauthentic about it. It's a tv show. It doesn't have to look like New York City. If you go to Egypt you see Egyptians if you go to Greek you see Greeks if you go to Russia you see Russians. Game of Thrones with all its problems casted very well and was diverse at the same time. \n\nThere's one scene where Ciri describes liking having Geralt as a father figure to someone. This is just bad storytelling. The obvious purpose is to convey to the viewer the changing positive relationship dynamic between Geralt and Ciri. How about showing us instead of having a character explain it to us? Maybe one touching father/daughter-like scene between the two. Did we have one? I don't really recall one. I know this would be better, it doesn't take a professional to see this, I'm certainly not one. I know Geralt had mutations and the world sucks there but he isn't incapable of smiling and having a nice moment. \n\nIf you haven't seen [\"A Night to Remember\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjJ614QfeM), the Witcher 3 launch cinematic I highly suggest you watch it. Geralt kills a bruxa here. It is 4 minutes long but is so much cooler and more emotional than the entire first episode of this season, which culminates in Geralt killing a different bruxa. Honestly, if they just tried to recreate this exact scene in the show it would've been better. Everything about the cinematic was better than that first episode of the show for me. I know the bruxa is a real character in Blood and Wine but it doesn't even matter. Just copy the fight and use a different song. \n\nSo now what are we left with in the show? Every group in the show just realized they want Ciri for something? If I was Ciri I might cut my own head off soon. Would be a lot easier. The show doesn't even have any real antagonists. Not really. Cahir? I found myself rooting for him this season. Dunny? Really? He isn't a bad guy in the game at least. He's Ciri's father.\n\nIn conclusion I feel Netflix would've been much better served just hiring the plot writers from the Witcher 3 game instead of overpaying these career executives to produce and write garbage. The game writers are clearly more talented, I'm confident if Netflix hired them and wanted them to hug the source material more than they did in the games they still would've done a better job than what the current crowd has cooked up here. Quite disappointing. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: Typos and part on father/daughter dynamic\n\nEdit 2: I’ve seen an argument in the comments a few times that they can’t be compared because one is a video game with many more hours invested in. I really don’t believe this argument holds water. There is still good and bad storytelling, good and bad dialogue, and faith to character. The show in my opinion struggles with these things while the TW3 doesn’t. Not all the questlines in the game are long and the plots seem to be much more satisfying than the arcs I have seen from the show anyway.",

The Bloody Baron, The Last Wish, Uma/Avallac'h, Ciri reunion, the Crones, Orianna, Towerful of Mice, and many more. The Hearts of Stone story was incredible, Gaunter O'Dimm was one of the best antagonists I have ever seen in anything. There are really so many main story and sidequests in Witcher 3 that are so much more well WRITTEN than anything in the TV show. After I finished season 2 I thought ok, they must've really tried to hug the books, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt again. But after reading this sub for a few days I learned most of the crap in the show wasn't even in the books. Like this entire Elf/Nilfgaard/Cintra dynamic for example. The show just feels more like complicated political mess than a thoughtful and provocative story about a Witcher and prodigious child. To placate the viewer from watching a lot of talking and confusing politics they have Geralt use Ciri as bait to kill a monster, flying through the air from off-screen, with his sword in two seconds flat.  First of all how irresponsible and out of character is it for Geralt to use Ciri as bait for anything? That's so dangerous and ridiculous. Then he calls Ciri brave. Ciri isn't brave for standing still while a monster, especially a monster unfamiliar to Geralt, charges at her without flinching she's just foolishly and blindly listening to some Witcher who doesn't seem to understand the danger of the situation and doesn’t understand to expect the unexpected. You know, witchers can make bait for monsters out of like herbs and meat and stuff, it's done a lot in the game. Trying this is probably wiser.  He even unnecessarily gets Roach killed. I kept thinking to myself while I was watching them prepare for the monster, get rid of the horse, get rid of the horse, get rid of the horse. I'm not a witcher, I'm just some guy and I knew to do this. If I know to do this the witcher should know to do this. He didn't get rid of horse and so it died. \n\nSpeaking of out of chacter what the hell has the show done to Vesemir? In the game and allegedly the books (I did not read the books but have heard) Vesemir is very wise, experienced, composed, and a father figure to all the Witchers. He is the one who knows the most answers and Geralt listens to him and takes instructions from him. The show makes him seem like a pretty old, confused, and irresponsible guy. How can he think to give Ciri Witcher mutagens? Especially without consulting Geralt? Geralt luckily catches him before he was able to do this and he just shamefully puts his head down like he knew what he was doing was wrong, and Geralt is his daddy scolding him. This is an unimaginable, impossible scene to anyone who played Witcher 3. \n\nThe shows best attempt this season at an emotional plotline was this demon thing they did in the last episode. It really was quite boring and felt like a bad 80's horror movie or a budget poltergeist or something. How cliche was Geralt? \"You can do it Ciri\", \"we need you Ciri\". Such garbage, like we've never seen that before. It was out of character on top of it all. Geralt and Vesemir knew exactly what the demon was but didn't know it had no place to go? Halfway through it is Yennefer who recognizes this so they have been just wasting time? How does she know that instead of them, the Witchers, the monster/demon experts whose group was responsible for sealing it? Oh my god then Vesemir stabs Ciri. That was the low point of the whole series I feel. When Vesemir just shivs Ciri. I cringed at that. Like what the fuck? Lol.\n\nAnd wow the casting. I thought Yennefer was okay in season 1 but in season 2 idk her age difference with Cavil really became apparent. I actually think Henry is doing a great job and was casted perfectly but he is 38 and this actress is 25. It's just weird and wasn't necessary for this show.  Would it really have killed the casting directors to hire a 30+ year old? I really feel like this was an unforced error. Even this would be easier to watch if their relationship with written with any talent and emotion. The Last Wish questline in the game with Yennefer was so good and EMOTIONAL. Nothing in this show is registering with me whatsoever with these two. And this Triss? This Triss??? They dyed her hair red in the second season as fanservice I feel. I know that its 2022 now and we all have to be woke and we all have to be inclusive but when you cast every single part in a show a person of a different ethnic background, even characters from the same region, there is something inauthentic about it. It's a tv show. It doesn't have to look like New York City. If you go to Egypt you see Egyptians if you go to Greek you see Greeks if you go to Russia you see Russians. Game of Thrones with all its problems casted very well and was diverse at the same time. \n\nThere's one scene where Ciri describes liking having Geralt as a father figure to someone. This is just bad storytelling. The obvious purpose is to convey to the viewer the changing positive relationship dynamic between Geralt and Ciri. How about showing us instead of having a character explain it to us? Maybe one touching father/daughter-like scene between the two. Did we have one? I don't really recall one. I know this would be better, it doesn't take a professional to see this, I'm certainly not one. I know Geralt had mutations and the world sucks there but he isn't incapable of smiling and having a nice moment. \n\nIf you haven't seen [\"A Night to Remember\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjJ614QfeM), the Witcher 3 launch cinematic I highly suggest you watch it. Geralt kills a bruxa here. It is 4 minutes long but is so much cooler and more emotional than the entire first episode of this season, which culminates in Geralt killing a different bruxa. Honestly, if they just tried to recreate this exact scene in the show it would've been better. Everything about the cinematic was better than that first episode of the show for me. I know the bruxa is a real character in Blood and Wine but it doesn't even matter. Just copy the fight and use a different song. \n\nSo now what are we left with in the show? Every group in the show just realized they want Ciri for something? If I was Ciri I might cut my own head off soon. Would be a lot easier. The show doesn't even have any real antagonists. Not really. Cahir? I found myself rooting for him this season. Dunny? Really? He isn't a bad guy in the game at least. He's Ciri's father.\n\nIn conclusion I feel Netflix would've been much better served just hiring the plot writers from the Witcher 3 game instead of overpaying these career executives to produce and write garbage. The game writers are clearly more talented, I'm confident if Netflix hired them and wanted them to hug the source material more than they did in the games they still would've done a better job than what the current crowd has cooked up here. Quite disappointing. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: Typos and part on father/daughter dynamic\n\nEdit 2: I’ve seen an argument in the comments a few times that they can’t be compared because one is a video game with many more hours invested in. I really don’t believe this argument holds water. There is still good and bad storytelling, good and bad dialogue, and faith to character. The show in my opinion struggles with these things while the TW3 doesn’t. Not all the questlines in the game are long and the plots seem to be much more satisfying than the arcs I have seen from the show anyway.",

        "title": "The Wheel Of Time show is a travesty. Robert Jordan's legendary work of fiction was transformed into something unrecognizable to push a certain agenda.",
        "body": "I was so excited when they announced that Amazon would be producing the show..  And then they released this...this..I dunno even what to call it..a travesty.  \n\nRobert Jordan's wife should sue Amazon for bastardizing the life's work of her husband and pissing on his grave... \n\nEpisode 8 was the pinnacle of that..Utterly terrible and disrespectful of the source material.\n\n\n**I'll let myself quote a post from**  [**RoryTate**](https://old.reddit.com/user/RoryTate)  **.  he made a great list of dubious and appalling changes Rafe and Amazon did. Thanx Rory!!**\n\n***THERE ARE SOME SPOILERS FROM THE BOOK***\n \n\n>TL;DR - Amazon's Wheel of Time show destroyed and sidelined the three  main male characters, turned male Warders into useless lowlifes, showed  all Fathers as only abusive or incompetent, presented all men as  arrogant, wrong, and inherently evil, made men physically weaker than  women, took all the interesting and distinguishable traits from every  male character and assigned them to women, turned the egalitarian  setting of WoT into some jarring Evil PatriarchyTM commentary, presented males as objects without agency who are therefore disposable, and much, much more.  \n>  \n>There is an almost endless list of male-hating scenes, storylines,  character changes, and more in the first eight episodes of Amazon's  Wheel of Time show. It seems neverending once you start objectively  listing them out, and I think the only reason that they aren't given  more attention comes down to a simple inability by many viewers to even  notice them happening. Unfortunately, this type of anti-male narrative  has been fully normalized in today's world (\\*), and so it is rarely  pointed out.  \n>  \n>So, let's buck that trend and list them out one by one, in all their misandric glory.  \n>  \n>Here's the list I quickly threw together. Please feel free to comment  on anything I missed. I'll try to edit in as many examples as I can  from the comments, but regardless, my hope is that this thread can  become a resource for anyone who wants to quickly point to all the ways  in which this show is a significant example of anti-male rhetoric, and  how the story as it is told displays an intrinsic fear and irrational  hatred of everything male.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The Aes Sedai (including Egwene and Nynaeve) have become the sole  main characters of the story, completely destroying and sidelining the  lead male characters (Mat, Perrin, and Rand), and greatly diminishing or  even removing all the male side characters like Lan, Thom, Elyas,  Gareth Bryne, and others...this stands in stark contrast with the  egalitarian books, which had the EF5 + Elayne (3 men and 3 women) as the  core six characters of the story, with a well balanced mix of important  side characters like Siuan, Cadsuane, Thom, Lan, etc (I recently read a  stat that women received the majority of the POV chapters in the final  seven or eight books of WoT, to give a better idea of what this show  compares against)  \n>  \n>Rand's father Tam – a war veteran and blademaster – could not kill a  single Trolloc when the village was attacked, yet untrained women from  the village succeeded in killing them with much less effort  \n>  \n>Rand's character trait of idolizing the hero Jain Farstrider is  given to Egwene, and Jain himself is then gender swapped so that all his  adventures and heroism are instead achievements of a woman  \n>  \n>Loial, an admitted author stand-in for Robert Jordan, has his story  beats in accessing and navigating the Ways given to the Aes Sedai or  downplayed to nothing, and then he is placed in an off-screen coma and  disappears from the story, only to awaken and return for no purpose  except to get lethally stabbed in the final episode (seriously, can  there be a more clear and open confirmation of the showrunner's disdain  for this story?...they basically stabbed Robert Jordan here and are  laughing at their own cleverness in hiding their hatred for him right in  plain sight)  \n>  \n>The Dragon is forced into being a title that both a woman and man  can hold, despite that making no sense within the show's own lore (i.e.  the Dragon status can no longer be a tragic death sentence for a  character – and the world around them – if a female channeler can be the  Dragon Reborn)  \n>  \n>Lan's backstory and motivation regarding Malkier have been removed,  and he says: \"\\[I had\\] nothing to live and die for before meeting  Moiraine\", which strips him of all agency, and apart from being shown  fighting alongside Moiraine early on (which has been revealed to be a  last minute addition only because Brandon Sanderson advised it), Lan is  shown as useless for the rest of the eight episodes  \n>  \n>The male Council of Elders was removed entirely from the Emond's  Field setting, yet the associated Women's Circle was featured  prominently as a governing entity  \n>  \n>The world setting now makes it men's fault alone for the Breaking,  with Lews Therin being warned of everything bad that was going to happen  preceding the Breaking (it is baffling that these calamities are  inexplicably predicted without evidence or explanation), and the  narrative is clearly established – in the flashback scene AND in the  opening voiceover – that Lews Therin only ignores the female Aes Sedai's  warning because of his male arrogance and ego (note: Lews Therin's act  is in truth a morally grey one...it had horrible consequences, yes, but  there was no reasonable alternate option known at the time for a world  on the brink of defeat by the Dark One, but this compelling moral  quandary is removed completely for soap opera melodrama that portrays  him as comically arrogant)  \n>  \n>Politics of the world seem to exist in a state akin to Schrodinger's  cat, where the Aes Sedai seemingly can control everything and are the  most powerful beings and group anywhere, yet at the same time they are  an oppressed and downtrodden minority in the male-dominated power  structures...the latter of these settings suddenly exists whenever the  show needs to show the Aes Sedai as justified in their violence and  anger at the world (i.e. torturing Logain, subjugating Warders, etc),  while the former is always the case when anyone dares question their  complete authority, or when the writers want to present them as the most  knowledgeable people about any and all subjects that could possibly  exist under the sun  \n>  \n>All men are presented as inherently evil...for example the  contemptible scene showing only male soldiers chasing down and killing a  woman giving birth on a battlefield, even when she is not a direct  threat to them (as proof of how abhorrent the average man finds this,  there is a believable rumour I've heard that many – if not all – of the  male stuntmen paid to work in that scene refused to do it without being  able to cover their faces, and those that didn't wear full face  coverings either had to be paid a lot more, or were threatened with  breach of contract by Amazon, in order to have them show their faces  while committing such a vile and disgusting act)  \n>  \n>Perrin is denigrated into a slow-witted and stupid brute, who kills  his pregnant wife because he is so clumsy, and does nothing but look  mopey, get injured, get rescued, and have no agency for the full eight  episodes  \n>  \n>Perrin's useful skills and talents as a blacksmith are given to his  wife, and he even has to be shamed into helping her with her work by the  other women in the village  \n>  \n>Mat is turned into an unredeemable villain and evil by nature, which  sadly removes one of the best and most beloved male heroes from the  story (note: for those who have not read the WoT books but who know the  LoTR movies, this awful decision would be like having Merry and Pippin  join forces with Saruman, simply because they stole some food from  Farmer Maggot in the opening – and as an added note: that arc for the  Hobbits was in the movies only, as they were not that irresponsible in  the books, just like Mat was only a prankster and an annoying rascal at  worst – not a thief – in the WoT books)  \n>  \n>Thom is now a thief and criminal, instead of being just a traveling entertainer who mentors the boys  \n>  \n>The Tinkers now have a female leader only, instead of the pacifist  group being led by both a male and female, as is the case in the books  \n>  \n>A stupid love triangle is created where none existed simply to  lambast Perrin and Rand – and by proxy all men who have ever been  attracted to a woman – as awful for viewing Egwene as some sort of prize  to be won, because masculinity is now \"toxic\"...<sigh>...wow,  that's quite a jump to assume the worst about every guy who simply  happens to find someone attractive  \n>  \n>The Aes Sedai's stilling, torture, and murder of Logain – and other  males – is justified as a fair act, because it is in response to them  having simply been born...as a male channeler they are portrayed as  carrying a form of original sin that excuses any and all violence  brought upon them  \n>  \n>Changed the nature of the taint on saidin to be a darkness and evil  that is created by – or exposed in? – men when they wield it, while  female channelers are all only pure and good, rather than the reality in  the books that the taint is a curse set upon the male half of the  source itself by the Dark One, and that the prejudice that exists  against male channelers is actually due to society-wide ignorance about  these men  \n>  \n>Fathers are only ever shown as useless, absent, abusive, or  incompetent: Rand's father no longer teaches him about archery or about  the Flame and the Void; Mat's father is abusive; Perrin's father doesn't  exist; Siuan's father relies on her, and abandons her when she has to  travel to the Tower; the three boy's substitute father figures while  traveling of Thom, Lan, and Elyas, are written out of the story, and no  longer teach them about fighting, juggling/music, or any other of the  many lessons they shared; Thom cannot protect the boys from the Fade  because they remind him of his lost nephew anymore, nor is he willing to  sacrifice his life, but instead he faces the fade by accident; the  ferryman dies uselessly while foolishly trying to protect his children,  etc...no Dad is shown as *mattering* to their children in a positive light  \n>  \n>Moiraine is uncaring and lets the ferryman die without even  attempting to save him, and later the Aes Sedai as a whole offer  recompense for the loss of the ferry, but say nothing about the value of  a human male life because it mattered less to them than a freaking boat  \n>  \n>Every Warder drinks, parties, or is irresponsible in some way, and  they are valued solely as fuck-boys and meat shields for women, plus  they are all nobodies until the Aes Sedai graciously give them their  skills and strength, instead of being respected, reliable, and deadly  soldiers who worked hard their entire lives to become Warders, and  formed a relationship with an Aes Sedai that was mutually respectful and  beneficial (this is such a disgusting and huge breach to the story, and  it is even more aggravating when the show wasted several full episodes  \"exploring\" and \"establishing\" this awful dynamic with a bunch of  unneeded fan fiction...honestly, I can't believe more people aren't  talking about this absolute destruction of Warder prestige, because it's  almost the single worst thing done to the story, and that's saying a  lot)  \n>  \n>Warders are shown as having no ability to give or withdraw consent  to sex once bonded, treating them as nothing but objects with no value  (one of the commenters I saw on one of the other wot-subs thought they  could counter this problem with the following (paraphrased): \"Well, men  are all such pathetic perverts that they would just enjoy being sex  slaves anyways, so this is no big deal\"...yeah, I shit you not, that's  the attitude towards a complete absence of male consent in the minds of  those who love this show)  \n>  \n>All men are physically weaker than women (seven trained and fully  armoured male soldiers are defeated by one pregnant woman, two grown  men, Rand and Mat, flee from one female bartender attacking them, women  from Emond's Field kill Trollocs easily while men cannot kill a single  one – or are shown to die when fighting them, etc)  \n>  \n>Any place or group that is a positive or well-run community is led  by a woman or women (i.e. Emond's Field has the Women's Circle and no  male Mayor or male Council anymore, pacifist Tinkers have a female  leader and the male/female duo is erased, Aes Sedai are female led, the  Tamyrlin running the Aes Sedai during the utopian Age of Legends is the  female Latra instead of the male Lews Therin, etc), while any negative  example is male led (Whitecloaks, Forsaken, Fal Dara, etc) or  male-influenced through deceit or cultural conditioning/the Evil  Patriarchy (I predict that this is how the Red Ajah will be \"redeemed\"  and shown to just be misguided but with good intentions, and if the  Seanchan leadership isn't gender and race-swapped then this is how that  evil Empire will be handled so that no one will \"feel\" it reflects badly  on women)  \n>  \n>Nynaeve is shown to be a better and more skilled tracker than Lan,  when only she knows – and this is never explained to the audience – how  to find Moiraine, despite him having spent decades traveling with  her...basically, all of his valuable hunting skills from the books are  taken away from him and given to her, leaving him with no use or purpose  to the story  \n>  \n>Perrin's story arc of murdering the Whitecloaks (in an act of self-defense) is taken from him and given to Egwene  \n>  \n>Lews Therin's title of Tamyrlin and the associated leadership position over the Aes Sedai is given instead to Latra, a woman  \n>  \n>Nynaeve and Egwene are stronger in the power than anyone else in the  show, and it is established that no one is close to their strength,  instead of having Logain being stronger or at least on par with their  ability to channel, and Rand being the most powerful channeler of all as  the Dragon, as was done in the books  \n>  \n>All the advantages that women had in channeling, like linking,  making complex weaves, etc, are still strengths that only the women  possess, but any benefit that was given to balance the abilities of male  channelers in the books is instead now something that only women can do  \n>  \n>Simply put, in Amazon's WoT, all the men are made to be weak, in  every conceivable way – mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually,  morally, etc – so that the women can be shown to be strong, rather than  just portraying both sexes as being skilled, competent, good, and  reliable people  \n>  \n>Lord Agelmar's character is turned into a caricature of toxic  masculinity, which is the exact opposite of the respectful and competent  leader he was in the books (note: this one change alone is enough to  ruin the climactic battle of Tarwin's Gap so badly that it becomes  completely unsalvageable as a story arc)  \n>  \n>The female channelers of Fal Dara abandon all the men to die to the  Trollocs, and do not assist them in any reasonable way during the battle  of Tarwin's Gap...it is suggested in the show that this is entirely the  men's fault, due to male arrogance and because they see the women as  \"weak\" (note: this \"women are inferior\" attitude is not clearly  established – and that is why I chose the word \"suggested\" – because the  writers really, really suck, but it is evident that this is what the  showrunners were going for in how everything turned out...either way, as  a result they present Nynaeve, Egwene, and the rest as irredeemably  evil because they listen uncaringly to every male die at the hands of  the Trollocs while doing nothing)  \n>  \n>Rand's hero moment of saving the Shienar army and the Aes Sedai at  Tarwin's gap is taken from him, and given to five untrained channelers,  while he does nothing but talk about how important and strong Egwene is,  before he just inexplicably walks off the screen and disappears because  he has nothing to do  \n>  \n>The male channeler Logain is placed on a leash as he is shown being  degraded and humiliated by the Aes Sedai, but the Seanchan's enslaved  female channelers are not portrayed with collars and leashes, despite  this being the manner in which they were controlled in the story",

How does he need his help? Jaskier was basically useless from there on. The writing on the second season was so bad this was just basically an excuse to have a \"bro moment\" when they hug and then to keep Jaskier around.\n\nThe most pathetic part is that Yen afterwards gives him some potion to deliver, he doesn't manage to, and they reveal that it would have been useless anyway. And why even add that scene of him crawling through the tables at all just to disregard it like that...?!\n\nIn conclusion, other than singing one great song and the sandpiper side plot, they had no idea what to do with the character. Which is a shame seeing he's one of the three best characters (Geralt, Ciri and Jaskier) in the show. But for some reason the show runner seems a lot more interested in making the season about Fringilla, Francesca and Yen.",

        "title": "Let's Talk about Philippa Eilhart's show incarnation",
        "body": "So Philippa is an obvious fan favorite character from the books and the games, and I'm interested in knowing more about what her version in the show is going to be like, since we didn't get a lot of information by the end of Season 2, just a lot of ominous Owl scenes with her becoming a girlboss at the end for 5 seconds. So why don't we compare what we know about Philippa's background in the books compared to what backstory we may expect for her in the show.\n\nIn the books, Philippa is one of the older/more influential sorceresses on the continent, but she still went to Aretuza, and still fought at Sodden against Nilfgaard with the other mages. She does first appear in her owl form with Dijikstra in Oxenfurt, but works with Geralt in her human form to track down Rience at the end of Blood of Elves.\n\nThe version of Philippa in the show did not fight at Sodden, and it isn't clear whether she went to Aretuza or not, if she's part of the brotherhood or not (who seems to still have power over Redania since King Vizimir was included with the other royals in the meetings with the brotherhood), or even if the brotherhood is aware of Philippa. Fringilla certainly wasn't aware of her owl form in Cintra, and when Dijikstra visited Thanedd to talk about Triss Merigold with the brotherhood, they never asked about Philippa. \n\nThis version of Philippa does not interact with Geralt at Oxenfurt due to the show having that event take place in Ellander, and in general the Owl form has a more sinister presence, and almost seems to control or manipulate Dijikstra, whereas their relationship in the books was less one sided in terms of power dynamic.\n\nSo this leads me to believe that Philippa may have a completely different backstory in the show (similar to how characters like Fringilla and Francesca and Lydia have pretty different backstories from their book counterparts). I'm not sure how different this backstory would be, but some unanswered questions from what little we saw of her include:\n\n1. Is she part of the brotherhood at all or even known to them? This is important because her role in the Thanedd events of Time of Contempt, and the lodge of sorcesses in the later books may be different if she doesn't already have a relationship with the other mages. I think she could still use her promise of \"building a world where the mages have power\" as a concept for forming the lodge, but for next season, getting involved with Thanedd will just be different. But if thats the case than wouldn't Aretuza have a different mage stationed in Redania?\n2. Is she known to other characters besides Dijikstra at all? Does Vizimir even know who she is, or has he only ever seen her in owl form?\n3. While Philippa's goals and actions in the books could be pretty self motivated and sinister at times, her show version seems to have taken it up a notch, due to her role in starting the conflict between the Elves and Redania by sending Dara to Cintra to spy on them. So this makes me wonder if her goals in the show are different at all from the books.\n\nSo what do you guys think? I really liked how they built up Phillipa bit by bit by just showing the ominous owl a little bit at a time, but at the same time I'm frustrated that we didn't see more of her human form or know more about her backstory in the world of the show, since by now we know that the show will take liberties at adapting characters in order to make a better television screenplay.",

Having foolishly played with fire, her magical abilities had deserted her utterly.\n\nJust thought it was interesting seeing a concept of a subsequent book being pulled in by the show for Yennefer's conflict in season 2. Obviously like many have pointed out (and lamented lol), not a direct translation of the books, but does show a way that the show is speaking to and coordinating with the original text. (I'm sure many already know this but thought it was interesting in my first read of ToC).",

In hindsight the queen should have looked familiar to me but I've got ADHD so I was like half in half out, but considering they set up the attack and ciri being told to find Geralt a while before and then all of a sudden we're back episodes later, I didn't even realize. I assumed that it was all going in a straight line of time. I don't know about the Witcher really at all outside of the show so I am very very new. \nPlease avoid spoilers in the comments.

        "title": "A commentary on the plot inconsistencies of Netflix Witcher Season 2",
        "body": "WARNING!! THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BOOKS AND OBVIOUSLY SEASON 2!!\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis isn’t a post on the differences from the book and the show. I was a fan of Season 1 and had high hopes for Season 2. I believe reimagining rather than solely adapting a book series can be done and can be done well (see the animated Nightmare of the Wolf). However, I feel Season 2 failed on all fronts. It was rushed, disjointed and was clear to me the overall execution and direction was very lacking. The aim of this post will be to analyse, raise inconsistencies **and facilitate discussion on plot-points that I took issue** **(this does mean this whole post is indeed subjective opinion!!)** with using the established lore of Season 1 and acting as if the original source material never existed (to the best of my ability). You're welcome to disagree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Characters**\n\n*Voleth Meir*\n\n* In their first confrontation with Voleth, Francesca saw Ithlinne, Fringilla saw Emhyr and Yen saw what looked to be a young Tissaia. Why wasn’t it just regular Tissaia? The show has been confusing enough in the first season for people that have no knowledge of the Witcher universe. Why add to the confusion. *EDIT: So it has been raised a couple of times that this is actually Yennefer. If this is true, that is even worse and makes even less sense. Why is she young? Wasn't she a hunchback? Why does she say piglet? Emhyr and Ithlinne seem to be accurate representations of themselves. Why is Yen's so different?*\n* Voleth is just used to decide their motivations and make them do what the plot requires:\n   * Alliance with Elves and Nilfgaard against the North? Check.\n   * Inciting Francesca against the humans of the North? Check.\n   * Yen meeting Ciri? (wow this is actually how it happens) Check.\n* Used this way, it bypasses any need for existentialism that makes characters feel real. Any personal choice, political motive or decision is now dictated by Voleth, forcing them to become one-dimensional.  Instead of empowering these characters, the writers managed to make them all helpless victims to the world and their circumstances. For a show that clearly wants to empower female leads, they manage to achieve the complete opposite.\n* Geralt says in the final episode that Voleth Meir’s ultimate goal was to return home which is why she needs >!the Master of Time and Space!<, Ciri. Okay, awesome. Once she has the body, what is the point of killing all the witchers? Why doesn’t she just leave and go back to the world of the Aen Elle? Just to have a nonsensical fight in Kaer Mohern? To “reveal” the Wild Hunt? *EDIT: It's been pointed out a few times now that the most logical motive is revenge which makes sense to me. I didn't really think about that at the time of writing this.*\n* Did Voleth Meir transform into the Wild Hunt? Is that what is being implied? Is she the Wild Hunt? *EDIT: Turns out, yes according to the twittersphere. It has been revealed she is meant to be one of the riders.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Yennefer*\n\n* In Season 1, Yennefer is quickly established as the most powerful mage in the Witcher universe. We are spoon-fed the idea that Yen wants nothing more than to have a child:\n   * She gets her choice of having a child removed from her when she transforms;\n   * She teleports back to save Queen Kalis’ baby at the expense of the Queen herself;\n   * She attempts to use a Djinn to restore her ability to bear children;\n   * She joins the hunt for a dragon for the same reason.\n* In Season 2, the show decides the only redeeming characteristic about Yennefer was her power. Nothing else. After watching the bond both Ciri and Geralt share in Melitele, Yen throwing her love for Geralt away to even CONSIDER sacrificing Ciri to regain her power is awful writing. She risked her life to save a baby she had no relation to a season ago. Why wasn’t this an opportunity to forgo her lust for power and go back to her Season 1 roots? Why would she give up having what she wanted originally, a child and a family? How can Ciri even consider her as a mother now when even Geralt himself mentioned he would never forgive her (we’ll see how long that lasts in Season 3). In the span of one episode we went from Yen being fully prepared to sacrifice her only means of having a child to then sacrificing herself to save said child.\n* How did she even get her power back? No, really. How? Fire magic consumes the soul (apparently). Was it her soul returning her? Where did it come back from?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Francesca*\n\n* ~~Francesca is a mage, why can she bear children?~~ Lara Dorren being both a mage and an elf refutes this point I made. My mistake, completely forgot this when I was making the post.\n* Gonna upset a lot of people but I’m gonna come out and say it. Her plotline is just Yennefer’s recycled. She’s tried to bear kids but none of them have come to term, so she asks Voleth to help her. I understand it was to reinforce the idea of “the future of the elves”, but it just ended up being a plot device to sacrifice to get her to ally herself with Nilfgaard which I find very lazy. What could have been a cold, ruthless and pragmatic leader is reduced to another female lead that can’t bear children. Awesome.\n* It also got us that scene in Redania which made no sense. How did they even get into Redania without any human interference? After seeing that scene on the dock where the elf said “Fuck the North” allowing Jaskier, Yen, Cahir and co. to board the ship, I find it really hard to believe a company of elves can just waltz down 1st Street, Redania casting spells on doors.\n* I don’t buy her line at the end of the series where she says the baby killings “wasn’t about revenge, it was about justice”. How was that justice? That’s probably the point the show was trying to make about her character but the way it was delivered under the context doesn’t do her any favours in convincing me she’s the best fit for the leader of the free elves. It felt like later season GOT where they just wanted to shock the audience for the sake of it without earning a scene like that with proper character development.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Vesemir*\n\n* It irked me that Vesemir would be willing to attempt the Trial of Grasses on Ciri. I know I said I’d act as if the original source material didn’t exist, but it really didn’t sit well with me. So you can go ahead and ignore this point and the next one.\n* Vesemir wouldn’t allow whores in Kaer Morhern. That’s it. He wouldn’t. Fuck that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Vilgefortz*\n\n* Season 1 issue and not a plot-hole (depending on who you ask) but how did Cahir beat Vilgefortz? One of the most powerful sorcerers in the Witcher universe. In a sword fight.  Future season spoiler >!but I can’t wait to be mad to see him suddenly best Geralt when they inevitably fight.!< Now you can argue he was faking this for his agenda (which I don’t buy because of how they shot the scene with Yen interjecting “conserve your chaos.” The worst red herring of all time if true), but it doesn’t do him any favours in being this supposed hero of Sodden bringing me to my next point\n* Why does Vilgefortz get to take Yen’s glory? Everyone saw that it was Yennefer who won the battle of Sodden. The reason they give is “I’m better at politics”. What gives? If you know the books then >!it feels like it is setting the stage for the coup at Thanned. Pretty lazy if this is the reason.!<\n* When did Tissaia and Vilgefortz become lovers? That was just thrown in there and wasn’t even remotely hinted at before.\n* This is a possible Season 3 spoiler,>! but if the books are anything to go off, then Rience and Lydia are working for Vilgefortz. Why then do we have the scene with Vilgefortz yelling at Tissaia for not pushing Triss on information about Ciri and the Elder Blood? Vilgefortz is already clearly after Ciri as he has already sent out Lydia and Rience to find her. That scene served no purpose other than showing Vilgefortz can yell. Perhaps it won’t be Vilgefortz in Season 3 in which case this point will be moot. But if it is, then it still begs the question.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**General Plot Holes**\n\n*Cahir’s Execution*\n\n* Why is Aretuza a place to execute prisoners of war? And knowing that it is, why are they using an axe? Foltest said that magic is forbidden by the use of spells which seems convenient and brings me to my next point:\n* Why is it forbidden? At ARETUZA. And how was it so easy for a powerless Yennefer and unarmed Cahir to just run out to a horse and ride away? After the North tried so hard to find and capture them and then invite the leaders of ALL NORTHERN KINGDOMS to the execution, did no one even consider to try and stop them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Rience*\n\n* How did he know where Kaer Morhern is? When he was interrogating Jaskier, all he had to go off was “in the mountains”. Now, no geography has been established so far (which I will get to in a later point) but there must only be one set of mountains on the continent.\n* How did he know Ciri was in Melitele? He said to Yennefer “Well if I’d known to follow you from Oxenfurt, it would’ve saved me a spy mission to Kaer Morhern.” I’m sorry what? Someone explain this to me please.\n* Why can he use fire magic without being consumed? All he says is “it consumes the soul.” Brilliant. This was stated in Episode 5 and was never returned to in the remaining 3.5 episodes. What does this mean? Tissaia established in Season 1 that there is always a give and a take when channelling chaos. How is the soul affected? Was Yen’s affected? I hope it’s not as simple as “bad guys can do the fire magics”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Geography and Time*\n\n* We need a map. And a clock. Where is everything? When is everything? Geralt ignored Yennefer all the way from Cintra to Kaer Morhern, probably a month’s journey in the book. A couple of minutes in the show.\n* Geralt and Ciri walked to Melitele. (???)\n* Fringilla massacres the Nilfgaardian generals in true Gaunter O’ Dimm fashion (if you are a fan of The Witcher 3 Hearts of Stone) but then delivers Francesca’s baby a couple of episodes later. *EDIT: I had these sequence of events the wrong way around*\n* Francesca’s baby was killed in Cintra. A couple of minutes later she was in REDANIA killing human Redanian babies. I feel these points speak for themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Kaer Morhern Fight*\n\n* How did Ciri sneak up and kill witchers in their sleep? Why didn’t their amulets resonate?\n* Why can’t a room full of witchers kill 2 basilisks? Is the monolith buff that strong?\n* What was the point of Jaskier being there? Comic relief? He said Yen gave him a potion to help separate Voleth from Ciri only for Yen to come in and do it herself anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**General grievances both related (sorry I lied) and unrelated to books**\n\n* Why does Nenekke swear so much? She’s a PRIESTESS of Melitele, a mother goddess of love, marriage, peace and nature. ~~Don’t need to read a book for that to feel out of place~~. *EDIT: So turns out she actually does swear in the books. Could not remember this at the time of posting. She's even a bit cruder in the original Polish text. (Thanks* [*morbidzanna*](https://www.reddit.com/user/morbidzanna/)*)*\n* Why did Emhyr openly advertise that Ciri was his daughter? If you read the books then >!Emhyr wants to marry her due to Ithlinne’s prophecy and bury the secret that he is the father.!< Not sure what the end game is now.\n* Tissaia berates Yennefer for crying saying there is nothing more pathetic than a weeping sorceress. I’ll just let that one sit there. *EDIT: I'll explain this one a bit more. Yennefer uses this in the book to chastise Ciri. I take issue with giving iconic lines to different characters. The irony in the show, however, was Tissaia actually cries a lot in Season 2. But that could be the point. Her cold, indifferent persona is just that.  A persona (not a fan of this personally).*\n* I could hear the laughter worldwide at Jarre’s accidental dick joke.\n* Fringilla using Vilgefortz’s line about “mistaking the stars reflected in a pond at night for those in the sky” pissed me off. It didn’t even make sense in the context of Cahir at the end of Season 1. She doesn’t deserve that line. And then using Geralt’s letter titled “Dear Friend” asking for Yen to train Ciri at Melitele. Yen made Geralt regret those words in the most sarcastic, sassy and cruel way. But here in the show, it’s like there are checkboxes next to iconic lines and the writers just roll a dice to decide when to insert them.\n* Destiny, destiny, destiny. The show does an awful lot of telling and not showing in regards to destiny. In the books, Geralt crosses Ciri’s path 3(?) times before the Fall of Cintra. It’s only then he decides there probably is a greater force at play bringing them together. While I appreciate how they did it in the show (not sure why they hugged each other since they have never met before upon meeting), the actions of both Geralt and Ciri should reflect destiny is at play here instead of 100 characters telling Geralt that he can’t elude his destiny.\n\nI could make a whole other list of things I hated about Season 2 but this is all I remember for now. I feel the show could have been a lot better if it just focused on a couple characters at a time. With such a wide audience and high demand for the show, I don’t see why they can’t stretch out the story across multiple seasons with better developed characters instead of trying to tell everything all at once. Feel free to call me out and discuss.\n\n*EDIT: A few of you are saying that these aren't plotholes or inconsistencies. While some definitely aren't (and some definitely are), the original title of this post was \"Things I Hate About Netflix The Witcher - Season 2\" but I think that upset a mod so it was deleted. I also mention this in the introduction (now bolded). I changed no content of the original post. Only the title was changed and it got way more traction that I thought. A lot of good points have been made to refute my claims, and I'm gonna do my best to go through them all and edit them if they seem logical enough. Thanks for the engagement! I want the show to succeed, and I believe fair and balanced criticism is a good way to get a show everyone will be happy with. The Witcher is an amazing universe and I want to see everyone love it.*",

        "body": "Just need to get this off my chest. Sorry if I being blunt.\n\nI understand the needs of using contact lenses for different irises colours. For Geralt’s Cat Eyes, for Yen’s violent eyes and Ciri’s emerald eyes. Thing is, they’re a bit too large, kind of fake and it feels like they are Anime characters. It seems to me the makeup artists did a wrong choices for the cast as it’s too distracting while they’re talking on screen especially when the camera zoomed too close.\n\nI love the new costumes for Yen, the black ones, which stand out and looks pretty. I like the way Yen look overall and her makeup looks so much so so much better than in S1. Getting rid of those unnecessary eyes shadows. Most of the cast clothes looks great except Geralt’s new armour…just a big no. The set from S1 I dislike it at first but it looks way cooler compared to the one from S2. Too sturdy, too fake, like it’s borrowed from a cosplayer and bringing it on set. I hope they can take inspiration from W3 game’s Witcher gears, like wolf school or bear school and it would be nice. The S1 armour kind of looks like the one Viper Set from Hearts of Stone but without those “silver rivet”.\n\nAbout Ciri, I mean she’s a princess, sure but she’s way too pretty especially when she was escaping from war, wandering in Brokilon Forest and rescued by Geralt then took her to Kaer Morhan but still wearing makeup and all those eyelashes and still have time to do her hair! Also wearing a dress given by Vereena but shouldn’t she supposed to be a more tomboyish girl instead of keeping her royal princess appeal and attitude? I mean she’ll then become Falka with the Rats later but I don’t see she grow from princess to a she-Witcher as she supposed to. The way they dress Ciri and her makeup was just off. I like the actress she’s young and portrayed Ciri on point. But come on, she don’t even have any dirt on her face not even a bit. When Yen and Fringlla was captured by the elves they both look as they supposed to be and it was good however it didn’t happen on Ciri at all.",

I think it looked too blunt and hinted at to be just a minor plot detail/filler or some kind of fan service (??) .\n\nI had the impression that they were (not really subtly) trying to build something up for S3 but I understand that this would be something that does not exist in the books. Is there a way where this pairing would make sense in the long run and somehow line up with the original storylines? \n\nI don't know I just rewatched a few episodes and to me it looks like they gave it too much space for it to mean nothing 🤔. More chemistry going on in that single episode than in the whole season! \nI read somewhere that Chair's actor Eamon Farren also hinted that there was something more going on in an interview?",

        "body": "Let me start this off by saying:\n\n\\- Henry Cavill as Geralt is still a hands-down triumph every moment he spends on screen. \n\n\\- Jaskier is broody and melancholy and snarky in all the right ways, and that singing voice! \n\n\\- Yennefer's story at the beginning felt like mostly B-plot, but had an ending I felt mostly satisfactory.\n\n\\- Ciri's progression, especially in the early episodes, was VERY compelling. (after all, who doesn't love a good training montage, especially with all the interesting twists?)\n\nThe strength of the Witcher Season 1 was absolutely its characters, and that continues into Season 2. The Core 3 plus the other added secondary characters made it easy to watch and enjoyable.\n\nBut I found myself feeling incredibly unmoored from the world. \n\nI know NOTHING about the other kingdoms beyond the Nilfgaardian Empire (and even then, annoyingly little), or how the Brotherhood and Aretuza fit into the politics of the realm (and what is that realm anyways?). \n\nThe Conjunction? The backstory of the Elves? Dwarves? The monoliths? The prophecy? The potions and elixirs the Witchers pop all the time? NOTHING. \n\nI'll say that I haven't read the books, and I'm about 10 hours into Witcher 3, so I'm a total newbie to this world.\n\nBut I think that's one huge problem that the TV show fails to address properly, especially in Season 2. It doesn't dive into the world, but keeps a really surface-level explanation of everything. Though in S1 we got to understand a bit about magic and its cost (as shown through Yen's eyes), S2 doesn't give us anything more to work with in that regard. \n\nAt the end of the day, I walk away from the Witcher thinking, \"Man, what a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g fantastic character who does cool s\\*\\*\\* that I can mostly remember as swinging a sword and being overall hella badass\", but I can honestly say even just a few days after finishing it, I don't remember much of the actual story at large. \n\n**I will keep watching the Witcher TV show happily for as long as it's made, and I know that playing the game will flesh out the world. But am I alone in WISHING the show gave us more worldbuilding to sink our teeth into?**",

Yet he goes above and beyond to defeat the black cloaks an Sodden, while most mages sat it out.\n\nIs it ever explained? Did the gain in status in the brotherhood matter that much? Even though making the mages heroes was rather contrary to their future plans? Did Emhyr need an opportunity to end a war that had fulfilled everything it was going to fulfill for him? Did the bloodbath then serve the same purpose as Brenna would?\n\nAlso, what's Yen's reasoning for bringing Ciri to Aretuza in the middle of a coup she very clearly saw coming? Was the idea to school her there genuine? Surely Yen had ZERO possible hope of Ciri staying there incognito longer than five minutes. In which case, did she simply sign off on tearing her from Geralt to offer her on a platter to the mages? Knowing what the mages who manipulated her entire bloodline had in store for her? And as to obeying Tissaia's request to bring her to the coup itself, was that a reaction or was it the plan all along?\n\nIt seems wild as a course of action for someone claiming to see Ciri as a daughter and loving Geralt. I'm not at all saying it's out of character, rather that the novels spend surprisingly little time on her motives at that point.\n\nOn a side note, I really wonder how the show can connect from the end of S2 to the events of Thanedd...",

        "title": "In Defense of Hollywood Adaptations (Or...Subjectivity in Art)",
        "body": "We've had a number of different posts railing against recent fantasy adaptations, and for good reason. They've been really divisive, and fantasy fans are a loud and passionate bunch. There's nothing wrong with that. \n\nBut I feel really left out in these conversations, because by and large I've enjoyed the recent Hollywood adaptations. Wheel of Time, Witcher, you name it. I'm not without my criticisms (we'll get there), but I would say I like the shows far more than not. And, for the sake of a healthy discourse (these subs become echo chambers *so* easily), I want to talk about why*.*\n\nFirst off, it should be noted that I've read all of WoT, some of the books multiple times. I've read through The Time of Contempt in Witcher, and Blood of Elves twice (and I plan to finish the series after I finish Malazan). I've also played The Witcher 3 *twice.* I was a fan of these properties well before the shows came out.\n\nI also am not someone who just casually likes tripe. I prefer character-driven stories with sharp dialogue, clever twists, and deeply flawed heroes. My taste tends toward \"gray\" narratives. Succession is my favorite show on TV and imo one of the best written and acted shows of all time. Dune was my movie of the year. I really chafe against cheese in shows and books alike, which makes melodramatic book series like The Wheel of Time or The Faithful and the Fallen very frustrating reads at times. And the adaptations we're talking about have their fair share of cheese as well. I also liked--but did not love--Arcane, because the dialogue was often cliched and many of the characters were just archetypes. (I also think it was the victim of overhype in my case, though the animation really was beyond compare.)\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that I'm actively pursuing a career as a TV writer in Hollywood. I've literally studied film, worked for production companies and had an insider look into how the sausage gets made. That doesn't mean my opinion should be taken more seriously than anyone else's. I'm just saying I love the medium of television as much as I love books. \n\nI think the audiences for TV shows are largely different than the audiences for fantasy books. And not just because the shows by and large are supposed to appeal to the lowest common denominator (though there's certainly a little bit of that). The expectations are fundamentally *different.*\n\nLet's get into specifics. Let's talk The Wheel of Time.\n\nI liked episode 8. And episode 5. And 1, more or less. I had issues with 'em, though. The whole Egwene-healing-Nynaeve bit was beyond stupid, regardless of whether or not Nynaeve was dead. Fakeout deaths are lame, and deus ex machina superpowers are even worse. The finale, and the show in general, frequently *looked* far cheaper than it was. Some of the dialogue throughout the season was incredibly ham-fisted (though the books aren't any better in that regard). Episode 1 was incredibly choppy (a victim of its exec-mandated hour runtime, no doubt) and it had one of the worst openings to a TV show I've ever seen. I also think Perrin was underwritten. Maybe Egwene, too.\n\nBut I think the good outweighed the bad. My whole family of non-book readers loved the show, perhaps more than I did. The Dragon Reborn mystery had them hooked and they loved our main cast. I felt the core of the characters was maintained. I see what changes like Mat's parents and Perrin's wife add to their arcs long term (and upon rewatch I appreciate the subversive choice of having Perrin hesitate and ultimately *fail* to act in the finale). These changes *show* what the characters *think* and *feel* in the books. They make them more fucked up, they make the story edgier, and I love that. I loved episode 5 for how it slowed down and fleshed out the world and Lan and Moiraine, in particular. It developed their characters, their relationships. It displayed the power of Aes Sedai/Warder bonds. Was it at the cost of E5 character development? Yeah, sure, but I think they got a solid amount of development for 8 episodes (and honestly Rand and Perrin are the *only* well developed characters in the first book, and even they're kinda stilted; please, downvote away). Longterm these changes will add to the overall narrative, and the E5 will only continue to be developed further. \n\nBottom line: this show had to do a lot of ground work. It had to be an ensemble show with source material that only focused on one character (Eye of the World). Rand's got less to do, but just as much character development as in the book. Moiraine and Lan and Nynaeve and Mat are all far more complex and do far more during the season as a whole than they do in the book. And we got Logain! And shit, Liandrin is more complex. Frankly, the characters were by and large *more complex* in the show than in the Eye of the World. The logistics of the world are wonkier, and the story is less focused, but the cast as a whole is richer. \n\nAnd that IMO is the core of the difference between audiences. \n\nBook fans often want to see the works they love very closely adapted (for good reason! The original was awesome!). They want to understand changes right away, meaning anything wildly different will be treated with skepticism at best, prejudice at worst. Fantasy book fans usually want cohesive worldbuilding, logical narratives, and capable heroes, which are so often the main draws of their favorite works. \n\nShow viewers latch onto spectacle, conflict, and characters. Because TV as a medium focuses so much more on small interactions (brief looks exchanged, dialogue, etc.) and we have literal people (i.e. actors) to get attached to, it tends toward character-centric storytelling. You often get love triangles in TV shows because romance is inherently a character-driven confict (note: I'm not a fan, but like any trope it can be done well). You often get characters doing absolutely dumbshit things to drive the story. Illogical things. (\\*cough\\* people are illogical \\*cough\\*) Even procedurals, which are indubitably plot-driven, have one consistent core element that draws the viewers back in episode after episode: their characters. You get to see the little moments, their favorite candy, their birthdays, etc. that you wouldn't see in more focused, dynamic stories. And shit, I don't even like procedurals, but they got that going for them. \n\nOne preference is not better than the other. Taste is subjective. Art is subjective. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Just because you don't connect to a particular adaptation doesn't mean it \"butchered\" the books or the writers are all \"hacks.\" Maybe they're just focusing on different elements than the ones you prefer. Maybe the stories are aimed at different audiences. \n\nPlease, let's debate this. I'm happy to give more examples, and to delve into why I like The Witcher (which had even more sus changes than WoT imo) and felt less love for Arcane than your average Redditor (though I did really like it!). I fully expect to be mobbed in the comments lol.",

I know that lot of people said that she took some storylines of other characters which is not good I guess but again I'm watching it as separated things so I don't care that much. Actually I love S1 Yennefer. I love the background storyline they created for her, I loved her more than in books in this Djinn episode in some moments (aspects, with some lines they added for her). I enjoyed her character so much. I wasn't that happy with her in S2 but nothing horrible. And I LOVE Anya in this role, I think she is great actress and how she portray Yen is just 10/10 for me. I really feel like she is getting too much hate and it makes me sad. I know it could be better in some aspects. But I still think that she is really enjoyable character, so if there is anyone with the same opinion, let me know please 😂😂 I feel like I'm the only one",

I stead of that awesome \"As usual, animals and children noticed him first\", in my book it reads \"Later, it was said that the man came from the north, from Ropers Gate.\"\n\nSo, I wanted to ask: Are there different versions of \"The Last Wish\"?",

        "title": "TV show already ruined Thanedd plotline: BOOK SPOILERS",
        "body": " I have no idea how Thanedd can happen. It either wont happen or if it does it will be extremely underhelming compare to the books. Lets go over several characters who were supposed to be there but can´t be there because of how story played out in season 2:\n\n**Yennefer** \\- can´t be there because she is already outlaw which in the books was result of the Thanedd. So she can´be logically there. Unless of course tehy will handle it like Vilgerfortz role in Sodden and they will forgive her and Yennefer will make dumb decision to come here like nothing happened, because logic is not something characters use in this show. Can´t decide what scenario is worse.\n\n**Ciri -** again can´t be there, because she was there only because of Yennefer and now everybody already wants her dead and knows who she is. So I can´t really imagine scene with Tissaia, Yennefer and Philippa like in the books without Tissaia killing Ciri on spot or when she sees her. Same for other people who are supposed to be here. Again in TV show she would either go with Yennefer after she stupidly goes there because they forgive her and she believes it or she will go on her own as part of some run from home after some disagreement. Again terrible plotline.\n\n**Geralt** \\- he was there only because of Yennefer and Ciri. He has no logical reason to be there.\n\nAs you can Thanedd cant logically happen with our characters. Of course it can happen without them, but that it will be extremely underhelming, because only characters there will be side-characters. Like why we should care about this conflict if nobody from main characters is there. To watch who will come on top in pissing contest between Stregobor and Vilgerfortz?\n\nWhich is another problem? Will the show really have balls to killed off Tisaia in the same manner as in the books? Will they able to get rid off such name as Lars Mikkelsen? Thats what I am afraid off because this is not only question of narrative but in case of tv show how characters are popular. I am afraid that they will simply make it much cheaper to keep great stars there. I am also not sure if they not give last middlefinger to book funs and giving Vilgerfortz role to Stregobor, which after he tortured Yen in very similiar manner like Vilgerforty in books is definetly possibility. What do you think?",

        "title": "Netflix's The Witcher is a Perfect Fantasy Series Adaptation",
        "body": "[Full Version Here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSXyC8o_SfM) \n\nSet in a world filled with magic, monsters, elves, The Witcher tells the story of a solitary monster hunter roaming the continent until events are set in motion that bring about the fulfilling of a long lost prophecy that could change the world forever.\n\nWe immediately know that monster exist in this world. Geralt kills monsters. The world hate people like him , but at the same time needs them. He's also new to town, implying that he travels a lot, which coupled with people's opinions of Witchers, it's no wonder that Geralt of Rivia is a solitary man, preferring his horse to actual people.\n\nAnd by the end of the pilot episode we also know everything else we need to know about him too. He's seen evil, and battled monsters. And he knows that sometimes the worst monsters of all can actually be people. He doesn't want to take sides, but cant help but doing what he thinks it's right in the moment. Which puts him in some lose-lose situations in the public opinion more often than not.\n\nHe's virtually unmatched in a fight, yet holds the demeanor or a pacifist because he knows that if he has to pull his sword someone will die. And he doesn't die easily.\n\nHenry Cavill's acting was superb as our titular character. He had the physicality to pull off monster hunter with the demeanor of a lowly commoner. It's a balancing act between Greek and meek, and he splits the difference easily, only straying when his character needs to. Not to mention his perfect delivery of his catchphrase.\n\nThe second standout is Anya Chalotra as Yennifer, the mage who wants it all and will do almost anything to get it. While Geralt is driven almost exclusively by duty, whether it's to the jobs he takes or the values he holds, Yennifer is driven by little more than a thirst for power. And I love that its not in any way that makes her the bad guy. In fact, her story is almost a sympathetic one for most of the time.\n\nWe also meet a princess who wants to be normal. She dresses as a commoner to play games with other local children and absolutely hates the posh and proper royal events she has to attended. But that's quickly overshadowed  as we watch as her guardians try and fail to hold off an attack on the Capitol, and we quickly learn that the princess is special in ways that even she doesn't know and everyone gets to piece it all together throughout the show.\n\nThe pilot episode sets our main characters paths on a collision course with each other, and everything else from there on out are just adventures and side quests that slowly but surely pull those three together.\n\nWhile I do like Freya Allan's acting in the role, so far her character kind of just feels like a walking McGuffin. She's nearly the sole objective for all the major characters, and spends most of her time running and hiding from them. She's basically the center of all the stories, yet most of the storytelling happens around her.\n\nIt wasn't until the second season where she really felt like she was coming into her own as a character. And I do have hope for her moving forward, especially knowing just how important her development is in these stories.\n\nAnd while this show is mostly reliant on the strength of these characters and the truly epic nature of their story and adventure, the show didn't cut any corners when it came to creating some truly fun and action sequences. I mean, the choreography that went into some of these fights was just incredible, with each new one bringing something new to the screen whether against monsters or humans. They themselves are reason enough to watch the show.\n\nI do think that the original season was a bit better than the second, but maybe that's just because it was more of a new and novel idea back then. But the second season is still really good. My biggest issue was that it felt like it moved too fast. Like it was skipping over events and details and giving us the cliffnotes, without telling the full story. Especially is the storyline surrounding The Brotherhood.\n\nBut overall,, this is a really fun show. And while I don't usually like to bingewatch whole seasons at once, this is one of the few where the episodes just flew by and I found myself at the end in just a couple of days. It gives you everything you want in a fantasy series; adventures worth watching, monsters and magic to spice it up, a bit of geopolitical conflict to keep the world on edge, awesome action and battles to keep you entertained, and a personal journey to make it all worthwhile. The Witcher delivers it all.\n\nRumors of an additional 3 seasons to cover all 5 books of the main Witcher Saga, and if that turns out to be true, then I'll gladly watch every episode we get, especially with so many more characters to introduce and places the story could go.",

        "body": "For something that doesn't have that much screentime, it's honestly surprisingly well detailed.\n\nStregobor is a petty jerk, but that's not the main threat he represents. He wants to reignite a culture war against \"impure\" magic users that have gone somewhat dormant in recent times. He wants it because he is a petty jerk, who still might be convinced of the righgeousness of the positions he's defending. His grudges and short-sightedness are more of an obstacle than anything in the current crisis.\n\nTissaia is a more proactive version of her book self, wanting to stabilize balance of power by unifying the North and checking Niilfgard's advance. However, her domineering personality and cultural bias towards the Northern Kingdoms leave her somewhat blind to how partial and self-interested it can make her look.\n\nArtorius is the ultimate centrist, only interested in preserving the position of himself and his fellow mages, but waiting for the problems to happen rathen than nipping them in the bud and openly concerned about his political status when challenged. Since he was wrong about Niilfgard, he is pretty discredited and forced to ally with Stregobor's reactionnary rethoric against Tissaia and Vilgerfortz's rise.\n\nVilgerfortz is pretty great, because you can read his action under two different lights. You can see a smarter than average mage who realize how breaking the sorcerer/sorceress divide would be great for his career and who uses Tissaia's desire for intervention and infatuation with him to form an alliance against the traditionalist in the council... Or you might have read the books and >!realized why he knows the magnitude of Niilfgard's threat and why dividing Aretuza might be useful for him.!<\n\nAll in all, I like how the pieces are set and the motivations of the character are understandable.",

        "body": "Don't get me wrong, I'll watch the crap out of both of these franchises. And I love that we are at a point in history where we can actually debate which tv fantasy series is better (10 years ago, that wouldn't even have been a dream).\n\nSo with all that being said, here's the long and short of why I have the opinion I do:\n\nThe Witcher: has an epic storyline and awesome beasts and monsters to fight and a deep lore (deeper than WOT, no question). But when it comes right down to it, I find both the acting and the writing sub-par compared to WOT.\n\nWOT: I'm a middling fan of the books (I made it to 7 and then gave up, but re-read 1-4 before the season). And honestly, this is one of the few visual medial endeavors that is actually *written better* than the source material. If you go beat by beat through the first book, there are a number of things that the show does better than the books.\n\nNot that we're comparing the scores on the 'adaptation' scale alone. Here's one thing that I found when watching WOT that I didn't get from the witcher: they *acted the shit* out of that series. Whatever you want to say critically about any other aspect of the show the writing, directing and acting came together in WOT in a way that brought me to tears several times (I'll answer comments below if people want to know when or debate me on which scenes).\n\nThe witcher's writing I found rather scattered and not motivated from an acting point of view. And don't get me wrong I *love* Henry in the lead role, but I often find he's using his yellow contacts and gravelly voice to do all his acting for him. Some of the best performances of the series came from the secondary characters (and Ciri, she hit it out of the park every second she was on screen).\n\nPart of the problem is that even if you have a good actor if you don't give them a meaty script, or a director who understands the emotional journey, the actors are lost or feel like they have nothing to do but say the lines. WOT was stellar in not only writing deeply emotional moments for the actors, but having a director who 'got' what the emotional journey was and helped (or allowed) the actors to express that journey on-screen.\n\nI've seen a number of criticisms of WOT from the frame-rate to the divergence from the source material, but taken by itself that series provoked an emotional reaction from me numerous times. I haven't had that happen to me in a fantasy series since GOT (may she rest in pieces).\n\nIn conclusion, I hope they both continue, I'll watch the shit out of both series if they go 20 seasons, but for my money, WOT is a better final product than the witcher.\n\nTLDR: Witcher: a fun romp, WOT: the team wrote, directed and acted the shit out of that series.",

        "title": "Just finished the Season 2, my thoughts (spoilers)",
        "body": "Well, I just finished the finale, and that final scene was... well, something. I'll preface this post by saying that I have not played the games or read the books yet, but I plan to in the future. And I'm posting here instead of the post-finale discussion thread because all those posts are nearly a month old and mine likely wouldn't be seen. Anyway:\n\n1. First episode was *superb*. One of the best of the whole series. It has a nice, contained story arc, and a monster I could infer a lot about even though Geralt didn't sit down and explain to Ciri what a bruxha is (reminded me of the vampires in the original *Fright Night*). And Tormund cleans up nice (even though he wasn't a very nice guy)!\n2. I'll be honest: Kaer Morhen was... weird. I mean I like that the Witchers were all close, and not such solitary beings after all, but there was a strange lack of discipline. I'm gathering they're *not* like that in the books? (Also, I'm pretty sure all those prostitutes died trying to find their way back to their town from the keep. Unless absolutely everybody knows where the keep is now, or something.)\n3. Freya Allan is a very good actress. It helped that she probably had the best writing this season, but she delivers beautifully and really understands Ciri. The only other thing I've seen her in is *Gunpowder Milkshake*, where she has a scene playing the younger version of Karen Gillan's character (movie is very pulpy and I highly recommend it). She played well off of Lena Heady in her scene, and I hope Allan has a great career moving forward.\n4. I did *not* expect Dara to return. At all. He was a nice surprise! Even if he still seems to harbor some disdain toward Ciri (which, admittedly, is understandable).\n5. Sore spot: I don't understand the politics of this show, and I'd like to think I'm not dense. I get what Aretuza wants, and Nilfgaard. But... Temeria, I only know Foltest and Strygas. WTF is Redania (other than a place where mages can turn into owls, *Clash of the Titans*\\-style)? And who are the other Northern Kingdoms in this alliance? I know nothing about these kingdoms' cultures, or anything they might want besides a land grab, yet I seem to be expected to care. Stop trying to be *Game of Thrones* (Tormund notwithstanding).\n6. Another sore spot: Yen was butchered this season. Her character is, in fact, my primary sore spot. I cannot believe she was willing to sacrifice a young girl - any young girl, a young girl like the one she had been when she first portaled from people trying to hurt her - for her powers. I just couldn't buy it, even before she found out who Ciri was and tried to undo her course.\n7. Cahir threw me for a loop. I like the actor - knew him before as the psycho Richard Horne in the *Twin Peaks* revival - and he played a pretty wide range this season. He had great delivery in his cell (\"She envied you... then\"), and I liked the chemistry between Yen and him when they were on the run together. But as soon as he got back to Nilfgaardian territory, he went right back to being an utter dick (the Dara \"sparring\" was absolutely not necessary). **7b. This show introduced a new shorthand for when you need the audience to dislike someone** ***right away*** **but don't have any apples available: stick 'em in a robe. Especially if it's outside of living quarters, and** ***especially*** **if it's silk.**\n8. I've seen some complaints about Istredd being \"wooden,\" but I disagree. He was actually one of my favorite parts! I like academic characters, though, and appreciate his motivations (he's helping persecuted people, but can't help getting annoyed when it interferes with his very important monolith studies). I even liked that scene with Simon Callow (another nice surprise!) where they resolved the mistranslation from Elder regarding the prophesy. The scene where he threw something at the bust of a king, then apologized to said bust, was one of my favorites.\n9. Adjoa Andoh was another surprise - I mainly know her as Martha's mother on *Doctor Who*. So hearing her swear was *very* strange! Which brings me to...\n10. Yet another sore spot: too much swearing. Way too much. I'm not exactly advocating a return to the Hays Code here, but sometimes restrictions foster creativity. Having character be *so loose* with cursing instead of more creative choices lessens the impact of when it could be useful - like succinctly calling the weird fire mage whose name you don't know \"fire fucker.\" Which brings me to...\n11. Fourth sore spot: Rience. And the woman with him (Lydia?). Just... their whole presence in the story was one of my least favorite parts. Given the taboo around fire magic in this universe, I do not feel we were given a satisfactory explanation regarding his ability to create and manipulate fire while remaining intact (\"extremely talented\" doesn't cut it for me). And with his newfound freedom he went about his mission very haphazardly, resulting in him stealing a vial whose contents he couldn't possibly have known for certain. (Him breaking into Kaer Morhen was my least favorite scene in the whole season, wtf was that?) And *then*, dumbass woman decides to \"trace\" the mystery liquid and is shocked that it melts half her face off. Just... two idiots with way too much power. And I thought they were one of Dijkstra's \"many irons,\" but it doesn't look like it (he's too smart for that, anyway).\n12. For about 5 minutes, Fringilla was my favorite character. You all know which scene I'm talking about.\n13. The \"White Flame\" is COLD. AS. ICE. Sacrificing another baby to try to get to his, knowing his Pavetta would *never* have condoned such a thing, and then arresting his two highest confidantes. I've already seen spoilers that Cahir switches sides at one point, which I was really doubting (see point #7), but I'm wondering if his imprisonment over this will be the catalyst. Now my question is why the heck the Prince Consort of Cintra would not have returned to his daughter and mother-in-law, if he survived the shipwreck? What could've prevented him?\n14. Final thought: er... Tissaia & Vilgefortz? When, exactly, did this happen? Am I truly dense - were there previous hints that I missed, that their alliance was more than political? Because I was genuinely surprised when Tissaia was looking out the bedroom window and he called her back into bed, lol! (No, seriously, did I miss something?)\n\nThis was kind of long, I'm sorry. But these are my thoughts now that I've just finished the season. Oh, that and that Jaskier is still awesome, will always be awesome, and his jail song was the best one yet. :-P",

Was it probably that they think the audience would be too impatient it they waited?\n\n• have they mentioned the Wild Hunt much? I know Yennefer and Geralt talk about it 'A Shard of Ice' but like mentioned, they didn't include that story. I don't remember what they've said of it in the show other than the ending .\n\n• did they use 'Jaskier' over 'Dandelion' because they wanted to keep the Polish or because it souded too girly? Even though Jaskier apparently means 'buttercup'. I don't mind the name (even though I naturally go to call him Dandelion) but I just feel like it probably confuses people who are unfamiliar with him and assume that's his actual name when it's meant to be an obvious pseudonym. Like, when [an English speaker] hears 'Dandelion' it's clearly a stage name like 'Pink' or 'Lady Gaga'\n\n• this Sandpiper stuff was new, right? Did he actually get involved with smuggling in the books or was he just chilling in Oxenfurt Academy? I don't remember.\n \n• I know they've switched up the story with Francesca Findabair but I can't remember the details in the books. Had she already met Yennefer beforehand? Did she have a baby? I can't remember if the show hinted that she was familiar with Ciri and tracking the Elder Blood. She doesn't seem as much a powerful and old mage here...\n\n• did they discuss why having an elf baby is so important? I know they talked about wanting pureblood elves but did the show talk about elven fertility and life spans?\n\n• I feel like they missed a chunk of exposition and Ciri's education by changing how Yarpen Zigrin's company were reintroduced. While they have touched on the elf and non-human racism in the show, that journey to the Temple School had pretty important information for the reader and for Ciri. They didn't talk at all about what Yarpen's mission was and of course didn't show Shaerrawedd or the roses which is pretty important in explaining the elf population. If they left all that out then did they just bring them back for a \"show up just at the right moment\" fight scene?\n\n• I am super confused about how quickly they seem to travel across the map. They name-drop locations yet suddenly appear in a completely different city. I don't know if it's just because they just didn't really show the passage of time or if they are suddenly able to go from Cintra to Kaer Morhen or to Temeria like they aren't opposite sides of the map. Why are Cahir and Yennefer in Gors Velen but then seemingly in Oxenfurt at the same time?\n\n• if Voleth Meir just wanted to leave the Continent (to the Aen Elle homeworld?) then why didn't she just use Ciri to open a portal and leave instead of going all murdery and bringing new creatures across? I mean, that would have saved Eredin a lot of time (even before realising he wanted her) if she did that lmao so obviously that would ruin the plot if that actually happened, but it still just didn't add up for me. Also, how old would she actually be?\n\n• I'm guessing they also cut out Shani because they didn't want Geralt sleeping with anyone else but Yennefer. Which is a shame because that scene with Dandelion climbing in through the window was pretty funny. Are they so hardcore \"Team Yen\" that they don't wanna mess with that at all? Is that also why they cut out the drama with Istredd and Geralt and how Yennefer was effectively two-timing before dumping them both?\n\n• people were complaining that Triss didn't tell Geralt that Yennefer was alive when in the book she actually tells him to go to her (and swallow his pride with all that Istredd drama) for help with Ciri because she recognises that Ciri being a Source is out of her skill range and that Yennefer is a much more experienced mage. Do you think this has misrepresented the characters? Did Triss actually not want him to know or did they just expect people to infer from her being cut off from listing the names that she assumed Geralt already knew or something? I dunno, that part felt like a cliché miscommunication from a romcom.\n\n• was the stuff with Yennefer losing her magic worth it? I went from being confused about the change, to quite intrigued about what they might do with it, to being disappointed again with that payoff. I wonder what it was like for people who have only seen the show and if it at least was enjoyable for them. Was it just meant to show that she was a stong women even without her magic or something? If so, then that kinda contradicts a lot of what I felt from her character being a very powerful mage and that a lot of it was to show that she's even stronger then a lot of the men.",

All of the stories were so memorable, and gave exciting insight into the life of a witcher, along with what makes Geralt of Rivia unique. I'd say that of the Witcher books, Sword of Destiny was my favourite.\n\nBlood of Elves - the \"first\" in the series - was slow at first, so much so that I contemplated putting it down. Ciri's time at Kaer Morhen was interesting at first, but got boring; then, when they were travelling with Yarpen Zigrin and his dwarves, it got worse: it turned into a looooot of walking. The second half, though, was really exciting, and the plot developments moved the plot along even when there wasn't any action. \n\nI enjoyed Time of Contempt, since it is basically what Blood of Elves's second half was: exciting me by either showing vivid fight scenes, or by explaining major plot points involving magical or governmental politics. >!Ciri's time in Korath Desert was pretty well-done, too, and I have to admit that I was impressed when the unicorn appeared!!<\n\nBaptism of Fire, the third book, is by far my favourite \"novel\" of the series; the action and plot development peaks in this book, with introductions to Milva, Cahir and Regis, whose bantering with Geralt - and Dandelion! - never failed to amuse me. I laughed out loud when they were travelling with Zoltan and the other dwarves (there is a lot of travelling with dwarves in this series), especially when they first met Regis and got drunk. \n\nThe Tower of the Swallow really threw me off at first, since it was told in a non-linear style, the frame story breaking the actual story so often that I felt like screaming, \\*What are you doing?\\* However, when I got into a rhythm, I got used to how it was told, and eventually found myself enjoying it. I did, though, find that Sapkowski was \"telling\" more than he was \"showing\" in this one; what happened to his luxurious descriptions of droplets of water springing over the rocks of a waterfall, glistening in the sun as they descended before breaking on the boulders below? >!Also, did the Rats even need to exist? They appeared for a bit in book two, were almost completely absent in book three, then died at the start of book four.!<Still, I tolerated book four, and enjoyed the big fight scene at the end.\n\nThe Lady of the Lake, the final book in the Witcher series! As in all concluding volumes, there should have been drama! There should have been gravity! There should have been a feeling that all things were coming to an end! Did I feel that way? No. >!I was sad when pretty much all of his friends died in the attack of Strygga Castle - which was a well-written fight scene, in my opinion - but Sapkoswki wrote it in too matter-of-face a tone. \"Cahir had his face cleaved off, blood sprayed across the statue\", yes yes, but I want \\*more\\*! We've spent a lot of time with these characters, so I want to be emotionally invested in their deaths! Then, when it is revealed that Emhyr is Ciri's father, it's announced so casually that it's almost like an afterthought.!<The closest to drama you get in this book is the Battle of Brenna, which is, admittedly, spectacular. However, I just felt that there was something missing from what should have been the most epic book in the series.\n\nI did enjoy the Witcher series, and am kind of sad that it's over.

There was this game called Daemonica where the protagonist investigated serial killers in a dark medieval setting and could talk to the dead - the first half of it nailed the feeling.\n\nMovies, anime, musicals - whatever, if it has them themes, I'll consume it :)\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "I keep seeing this getting passed out recently, but no idea where this stems from because it’s a misconception.\n\nIn the books Ciri is 15 when she gets wrapped up in the Rats, for those who have not read the books, to simply put it. They’re a gang, and a very terrible one. One of the male members >!attempts to rape Ciri, only to get stopped by a female member. That female member doesn’t stop the rape for the ‘goodness in her heart’ but because she wanted Ciri for herself. Ciri then gets raped by a woman, and is traumatized.!<\n\nThere (in the books) to this day, no writing passage where Ciri has shown interest towards woman. There are no other female lovers in her life and Ciri has never gotten “hot and bothered” for woman while there are men where she has for.\n\nCiri does not “experiment”, she is not “curious” either, if this was in the books (curiosity, and being turned on by woman, yes; that would make her bi-sexual) but the only woman encounter she has is >!getting raped, while she was terrified and exhausted.!<\n\nCiri is a Stockholm Syndrome victim. She even apologizes to Mistle for not “touching her” because she’s terrified and trying to survive. In the books Ciri doesn’t even get much time to process being a Stockholm victim because of the fast moving events.\n\nSo no, canonically *Ciri is not bi.* Getting raped, does not make you bi. It’s quite problematic, or weird to pigeon hole her as such, based around rape. Rape is *not* love, or any indication on one’s sexuality. \n\nThere are *actual* characters in the books that ARE, bi though canonically. Which isn’t a misconception. Philippa is one of them. Even Triss if I’m remembering right that is, had a short minor ‘thing’ with Philippa. \n\nThey don’t need to take victims like Ciri and alter her sexuality when there are already characters who are bi canonically.",

I guess she is still not yet shown as being a competent sword fighter so something should still be made around this.\n\n. Geralt??? What are they going to do with Geralt??? Is he going to be around when Ciri trains with Yen??? Or is he going on some monolith hunt with Istredd??? Maybe Rience hunt with Vesemir???\n\n. Istredd??? Are they abandoning him??? I say unlikely. So will he be showing up with some other characters??? who???\n\n. Fringilla??? What are they going to do with her??? She is no doubt a show favourite but what plot can they give her??? Start dealing with Lydia maybe??? Or back to plotting with Francesca and be friends again???\n\n. Cahir???\n\n. Francesca and elven plot still going on???\n\n. Vilgefortz??? They absolutely need to do more stuff with him!!!\n\n. Stregobor???\n\n. Tissaia???\n\n. Triss???\n\n. Phillipa??? Like Vilgefortz!!!!!!!! She is SORELY needed at this point in time.\n\n. Dijkstra???\n\n. Deathless Mother / Wild Hunt??? Are they going to be left outside like some White Walkers or are they going to show up more???\n\n. Emhyr??? After season 2 reveal....it kind of hints they want to do more stuff with him???\n\nA lot of these characters can well form clusters together. Some may well be abandoned. We do not know.....\n\nOne thing which kind of worries me is that they have a ton of characters to work with and they have not closed anyone yet. So they are just bound to have the same pacing issues of season 2....if not even worse. They have been introducing everyone just too fast and furious. Now they have almost everyone on screen and they need to do something with most of them.\n\nConsidering we have only 8 episodes.....\n\nWe also need to consider they are getting a lot of criticism about Geralt not being a lot on their show. And given how Lauren personally reacted to those criticisms.....considering how many characters I list above.....I say people should start expecting less HC on screen if they want to avoid disappointment. Lauren´s taking time and noticing these specific critics so hard.....there is fire under there!!! It got deep because its most likely what is going to happen.",

There is one question I've been pondering lately: was Yennefer really bad looking and marginalised by society before she was taken away by Tissaia and joined Aretuza to become a sorceress ? Being currently at the 2nd tome of the books, I have not yet found any explanation of that but the first season of the series portrays her as a hunchbacked young girl (apparently cursed because her father was a semi-elf?)?.\n\nAnother thing that confuses me a bit was regarding her infertility. Is it because she inhereted of the \"chaos\" and magic abilities that she is born infertile? Or is it because she modified her appearance to become a young beautiful and appealing sorceress in a quest of achieving even more power so a sacrifice was needed to compensate her physical recreation?\n\nThanks for clarifying this out, amateur witchers!",

        "title": "Why Dijkstra should win the war",
        "body": "The story of the witcher is directly related to the story of the Nilfgaardian Empire trying to defeat the Northern Kingdoms.\n\nIt all starts with the First and Second Northern War, beautifully portrayed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VISScJAyl5s&list=PL2Qq-rUSt7b2M0MwLZF8oq-BuoavZOkzz), by Wizards and Warriors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VISScJAyl5s&list=PL2Qq-rUSt7b2M0MwLZF8oq-BuoavZOkzz \n\nObviously, it includes book spoilers. And here's a related bit of trivia: Witcher Coen of the School of the Griffin fought in the Battle of Brenna. He died there but greatly supported the Northern Kingdoms.\n\nFollowing those wars, in Witcher 1 and 2 there are 2 significant events related to Nilfgaard. First, Nilfgaard tries to support Jaques de Aldersberg in the Vizima Uprising, in order to move Foltest away from power. He aids them through such people as Roderick de Wett, a family of the Nilfgaardian general Joachim de Wett (who was the main commander on the western front in the 2nd Northern War).  It is important to know, that it was Dijkstra who created the Order of the White Rose (later: Order of the Flaming Rose, the one ruled by Jaques de Aldersberg) in the first place. That was supposed to limit the power of mages. This move may seem illogical, it is however important to know that Dijkstra learned that Philippa Eilhart, a powerful sorceress, was behind the assassination of king Visimir II, father of Radovid V Stern.\n\nThe second important event with ties to Nilfgaard happens in Witcher 2 when Letho of Gulet is hired by Emhyr var Emreis to kill the Northern Kings. In return, Emhyr is supposed to rebuild the Witcher School of the Viper.\n\nLetho of Gulet, pretending that it's the sorceresses who are funding his Kingslaying career, kills King Demawend, King Foltest. Later on, it's very likely for both King Henselt and King Stennis to die, and Geralt may decide to let them be killed.\n\nThe resulting witchhunt by Radovid is purely because of Philippa Eilhart's actions against Visimir II and the alleged help for the Kingslayers of the sorceresses. Truth be told, Radovid later goes mad, while on the genocidal killing spree. It is however important to notice, that it was all set up by Nilfgaard. Initially, Letho was supposed to kill king Esteril of a politically neutral country Kovir and Poviss, but gladly didn't manage to.\n\nMeanwhile, Emhyr var Emreis, who has just managed to kill nearly half of the Northern Kings, breaking the peace treaties, crosses the Yaruga and attacks weakened Aedirn and Temeria. Radovid decides to attack the Kaedwen, which is quickly overtaken by him. This way the lonely Northern Kingdom of Redania and the Nilfgaardian Empire remain on the map.\n\nIt is clear that Nilfgaardian Empire is the aggressor and that they're ready to attack even the neutral countries. On the other hand, Radovid is insane and responsible for genocide.\n\nThe story of the Witcher has been both about Geralt of Rivia and the changing world around him: about the independence of the Northern Kingdoms and how fragile it is. I think at this point it's clear what choice is best. Dijkstra is a skilled ruler, and he will ensure that Northern Kingdoms withstand the Nilfgaardian attack. And even though I love the Son of a Whore Vernon Roche, I can't understand Roche being so hateful towards Letho and siding with Emhyr at the same time. Roche should ask Dijkstra to create a puppet state of Temeria inside Redania instead. But since we can't have it the best way, let's have it only slightly worse.\n\nEdit: When Roche wins, Nilfgaard takes over everything. In Tower of Swallow the Nilfgaardian \"independent\" states are described in terms of popitical power - they have none. Nilfgaard governs everything rekated to their external politics and ensures a set of internal laws.\n\nEdit 2: Toussaint has good living standards because it's a vineyard for the vampires, and Anaruetta is Emhyr's relative.\n\nCiri empress ending assumes Ciri isn't happy. She says it herself, that everything she dreams of is to be normal and carefree. Ciri is giving up her happiness for the possibility of making the world better in the future in the Empress ending.\n\nAbour Dijkstra threatening Geralt: In Thanedd, Dijkstra assumed Geralt isn't neutral and this led to the Redanian having his leg broken. This time, Dijkstra thinks that geralt will stay neutral, and only threatens him when he sees there's no other choice.\n\nAs to the out of charactwr behaviour: Dijkstra should wait for Geralt to leave or offer Roche a deal when Geralt is there. And Roche shouldn't side with Nilfgaard, who killed his king Foltest, who was like a father to the son of a whore Vernon Roche. There are two mods trying to explain this our of character behaviour: 'Dijkstra Doppler' and 'Reason of state quest endinf temeria fate'. I recommend using the latter, without the deleting of the gay subplot in White Orchard. \n\nHowever, as we are bound to the game itself, I still think that in the base game, Dijkstra is the superior choice. He is the only choice that saves the northern kingdoms and stops the witchhunt, and the story of the books and games has been all about the small northern kingdoms trying to withstand the big bully - Nilfgaard.\n\nEdit 3: It means giving up the independence to Emhyr and letting him control those countries. You also have to think about increasing commonality of slavery in the northern kingdoms, loss of the politicsl power of sorceresses, ban for the witchers from entering cities, especially in the Nilfgaard proper, which is to lay in Aedirn, Redania and Kaedwen, basically cutting witchers off from their school. \n\nThe story of the witcher is not only about Geralt trying to get his Ciri our of Nilfgaard, but also about Northern Kingdoms trying to resist Nilfgaard's agression.",

This allowed for **character building**, imagine that?  The subtle hints through that dialogue of what's to come was great to (re) watch.  One that stood out to me was when Tissaia and Yennefer were speaking prior to the Battle of Sodden.  Yen mentions she has no legacy, no family, no purpose left.  Then Tissaia reminds her that she 'has much more to give'.  Really powerful if you think about it.  Also makes you even more pissed at the events of S2...\n\nAll that happened in S1 made me so excited for S2, only to be left with an extreme sour taste even though I enjoyed S2 in most parts, but hated how we got there if that makes *any sense.* \n\nIf S3 can go back to that type of story telling from S1, and even improve on it *maybe* \\- If I were a betting man (which I am) I wouldn't bet on it, but we can only hope!",

        "title": "A deep dive into The Witcher books: Debunking common misinformation that Ciri is bisexual (using the books)",
        "body": "So, I (pathetically) have bit of a nerdy tendency (**and a lot of time on my hands cause I got covid and it's whipping my ass, shoot**) to read the books every year, it's become a tradition for me and I just finished reading the last book in the series almost an hour ago. I now have the books quite refreshed in my mind. Since picking up the books again, I've been seeing a lot of online (false) discourse about whether or not Ciri is bisexual.\n\n***\n\n**Origin of the Rumor:**\n\nI believe the myth of Ciri being bisexual (popular to render her as such) has been birthed from the games. A lot of people who played the games, may not have read the books. There tends to be a mix up that happens here as the games are **not** canon. Even if they aren't canon, they have adapted the books wonderfully in their own story.\n\nAnother (recent) refresher of this myth is The Netflix series. Just like the games - **the Netflix series is not canon.** The Netflix series (despite) stating they \"will\" be faithful to the books, have went their own route far from them. [It's been rumored that the series were going to portray Ciri as bisexual, and have Ciri fancy and desire Triss.](https://redanianintelligence.com/2021/12/18/deleted-scenes-and-characters-from-the-witcher-season-2/)\n\nThe rumour seems to be true, as the show runner, herself, confirms it [here](https://twitter.com/LHissrich/status/1476438970926092296)\n\n**These scenes have been cut. Since then, the repeated misbelief cycle has been reborn again.**\n\n***\n\n**Debunking the \"relationship\" with Mistle:** -- *Time of Contempt*\n\nIn the books, Ciri feels hopeless as she is feeling abandoned by Geralt, Yennefer and everyone else she's ever gone to know and loved. That's just the way Ciri *unfortunately* saw it. She was without meaning, and looking to find meaning. This led to her own solo embarkment and the introduction of 'The Rats.' The notorious murderous gang of troubled bandits who Ciri naively is now a member of.\n\nDuring Ciri's time in The Rats, she is quite young. She's around at least anywhere from (approx.) 13, to 15. It's been hard for me to tell even all these years later as there is minor confusion in the books regarding her age.\n\nOne of the first members who she is introduced to is Kayleigh and the push in why she joins the gang. During the very first night in the gang, Kayleigh (male bandit) at one point forces himself on Ciri and was attempting to rape her **until** Mistle, a female (bandit) steps in, and rapes Ciri herself. Mistle does not \"save\" Ciri, it is non consensual, and full blown rape where Ciri froze (fear), and was too exhausted and submitted.\n\nDuring the rest of her time in the gang. Ciri's relationship with Mistle **never** blossoms into a consensual one (it becomes worst). **It only was pushed by the threat of violence, and entirely drug-fueled (they use the fantasy version of cocaine in the gang.)**\n\n*This is a notorious fact that is left out as there is a lot of misinformation regarding this \"relationship.\"* They were never \"lovers\" as Ciri is a victim, and **unfortunately dark it is, it is common for victims of abuse to feel ambivalence.** This is where Stockholm Syndrome speculation is drawn from. It does not mean those twisted feelings were out of \"love\" or, drawn attraction.\n\nThere is also a brutal quote from the books which is the day after Ciri is raped by Mistle (debunking this as consensual; just plain rape):\n\n[**She spent a long time washing, trembling from the cold. She washed with violent movements of her shaking hands, trying to wash off what was no longer possible to wash off. Tears ran down her cheeks.**]\n\nThis entire quote in the books is introduction to Ciri delving into her darker side. It is the catalyst of it, and Sapkowski reminding the reader that this was not a loving relationship, but rather the thorns that grew around Ciri. It also represents the lack of interest, or love towards Mistle, as Mistle doing what she did, broke Ciri.\n\nDuring the rest of the time in the gang, Ciri has a taste for aggression, and continuing to lose her sense of self, as she becomes the mirror of them, and even darker. Ciri is so aggressive, that she snaps at everyone. She does not want Mistle putting **not even a hand** on her, and she even goes far to kick a dog out of frustration.\n\nThere is only \"one\" happy moment when it wasn't dark in the gang for Ciri, and it was spent when they went dancing. The only \"happy\" time Ciri felt in the gang, is spent with another women in the gang, while Ciri does not choose to dance with Mistle. This is more of a reminder that, Ciri and Mistle were *not* lovers, nor did Ciri see Mistle that way, or was attracted to her. She did not want to spend her only happy moment with her either.\n\nFinally, around one point, Ciri gets a copycat tattoo of Mistle's tattoo. People believe this tattoo is a memento of their love; but it is not. As Ciri the day after escapes the gang, and ditches all of them. She chooses to leave them all behind, Mistle included. She is later intercepted by Mistle, and forced to oath swear that she will not forget Mistle. Ciri accepts and keeps her promise.\n\nShe later leaves The Rats, only to be told by a rich man, that they are assassin targeted. Ciri feeling bad for them, only returns to save them, only to find them all slaughtered. She does **not** return to save Mistle. She did not even *care* to bring Mistle, with her. This once again gives clarity that their relationship was not consensual neither romantic, besides based off Ciri fearing to be alone. Mistle did not matter to her.\n\n***\n\n**Evidence of Ciri being attracted to men, vs women, debunking the bisexuality myth:**\n\n* **In the books, there is no existing transcript that exists where Ciri is attracted, or turned on by women.** There is the *exact* opposite:\n\n> Margarita Laux-Antille emerged from the pool with a splash... Ciri could not stop herself from taking a peek. She saw Yennefer in the nude many times and she didn't think anyone could have a more beautiful figure. She was wrong. At the sight of a naked Margarita Laux-Antille even marble statues of goddesses and nymphs would sob with jealousy. **(Book: The Time of Contempt)**\n\n* **Despite Ciri seeing Margarita naked, and Yennefer, Ciri shows no sexual interest, or even attraction towards their naked bodies** Instead, the quote is, \"goddesses and nymphs would sob with jealously\" as Ciri *wishes* she looks like Margarita, and had her body. - This is one of the big evident examples that discloses the myth that Ciri is into women.\n\n* One of Ciri's first relationships is with Hjalmar. Book quote:\n\n> “She visited him when he was lying in bed recovering after his famous leap. She read to him, told him stories, held his little hand… And when someone entered the chamber, they both blushed like poppies. Well, finally Hjalmar informed me they were betrothed. I almost had an attack of apoplexy. I’ll teach you, you rascal, I’ll give you a betrothal, but with a rawhide whip! And I was a bit anxious, for I’d seen that the Lion Cub was hot-headed, that everything about her was reckless, for she was a daredevil, not to say a little maniac… Fortunately Hjalmar was covered in splints and bandages, so they couldn’t do anything stupid…’ \n\n- Hjalmar and Ciri spent a lot of time, \"semi-innocently\" kissing. \n\n* When she was just about to sleep with Hotspurn, the quote is: [\"She yielded to his touch, and the pleasure that it brought.\"] Indicating she sexually shows interest in men.\n\n* She is attracted to Hotspurn, and has a butterfly feeling in her stomach, and was the one crushing on *him* before he crushes on her. (The Tower of the Swallow). \n\n* Another one of Ciri's love interests is Galahad, King Arthur Knight (Lady of the Lake) - Another man which Ciri gets butterflies in her stomach for.\n\n> She broke off, looking at his blushing cheeks and shining eyes. **At his actually not bad-looking face. Something squeezed her stomach and gut, and it was not hunger. Something is happening to me, she thought. What's wrong with me? \"Do not bother!\" she almost cried.** \"Let's saddle the horses!\" When they were in their saddles, she looked at him and laughed out loud. He looked at her, his eyes filled with amazement and questions. \"Nothing, nothing,\" she said easily. \"It was just something I was thinking. Lead the way, Galahad. \n\n* There are other male characters where Ciri thinks to herself that they are attractive, and she takes notice of it immediately. This thread is already long, so I might as well skip including the rest of them.\n\n* Even (as said above), throughout the books, Ciri takes no sexual interact, or attraction towards any woman, but with men, it's 'butterflies' or, 'getting turned on', and 'yearning for their touch', 'betrothed, and semi-innocent kissing.' Sometimes annoyed when men were not giving her attention.\n\n\n*** \n\n**Other Honorable Mentions:**\n\n* Ciri wants nothing to do with Mistle. She does not choose to willingly sleep with her, or wants to be touched by her. She tells her off.\n\n* Ciri is only nice to Mistle when Ciri had a plot, and was using them. Which is why Mistle confronts Ciri.\n\n* Mistle is so abusive that Ciri apologizes for not \"touching\" Mistle.\n\n* Ciri (almost sleeps), and is into another man, the minute she leaves the group, proving that Mistle was not her lover, or meant anything to her.\n\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\nThere you have it, Ciri is not canonically bisexual, and that this is a misunderstanding myth. \n\nNo where in all the books does Ciri show interest in women but desires and is attracted to various men, and had short relationships with men. Ciri can't have a relationship for the most part because she is doomed as she's been abused by many people her whole life wanting to use her, besides Geralt, and Yennefer. This leads to bad luck, besides (The Lady of the Lake) where she finds something close to it with Galahad.",

        "body": "I’m a longtime book/game fan who does like the show for what it is-which somehow convinces posters here I’m a “shill” or something-so I’ve decided to point out some of the things about the show that I am not very fond of.\n\n1. The costume design. No one talks about this. In S1 it is at best mediocre and fairly generic with the exception of Geralt’s armor. But the sorceress dresses are *atrocious* and Yen’s are the worst offenders. The costume designer’s dress concept in his own words was “Gothic meets haute couture” So in a world where the rest of the costumes are medieval/Renaissance, the sorceresses are wearing gowns that just by themselves are three hundred years out of period, but then with modern Paris runway fringes and tassels. The rope dress. The weird pipe cleaner dress with the Eyes Wide Shut mask and box shoulders. Tissaia wears a literal Miss Havisham dress from Dickens for Chrissakes.\n\n2. The Renfri story is done rather poorly. It’s not clear exactly what she’s up to because it’s very clear that for the pilot they were trying to avoid a ton of magic stuff to seem more like Game of Thrones. So they avoid the Black Sun stuff like the plague beyond a brief mention.\n\n3. I very much disliked how S2 dropped so many of Geralt’s sad-trombone fuck-up moments that are basically nonstop in the books. S1 did a decent job of this, combined with the practical-effect Evil Dead vibe that was also mostly jettisoned.\n\nI have more but three seems a good start. Maybe I’ll circle back around later.",

You have no idea how many people say they should choose another actress and that Anya did not deserve the role. \nBut as Yen said in episode 5 of season 1, my view is as follows:\n\"I'm afraid these look more like SHAIIIT to me…\"\n\nI understand that to all of you who say this you had different expectations either because you read the books or because you played the games. But that's no reason to underestimate Anya and the producers' choice to cast her in the role. Personally I believe that her interpretation was flawless and wonderful. Of course not everyone will agree with that and I understand. Personally, I do not care at all how she SHOULD be casted. \n\nAt first you can just see simple complaints on the Internet but if you search a little better and deeper in the end you will find people who attack her.\nAn example is that I entered her Instagram out of curiosity and in a random post she made with a photo that had nothing to do with the series, someone commented:\n\"They could choose another cast for Yennefer. Just saying” \n\nI really feel sorry for Anya. She worked so hard, she gave all her talent, she played the role so well and all this to have people to say that she should not even be in the series at all.",

From Kaer morhem to oxenfurt, to Cintra then back to Kaer morhem in just 2 episodes. It makes the world feel small. I watched a video about GoT that argued one of the main reason it went downhill was because it was rushed, not in the writing but in the pace. The first season basically covers a travel from north to south, and the second, an army Marching south, getting to cover only half the path. Then everyone teleports from north to south without effort. In the Witcher books (SPOILERS BC IDK HOW TO USE SPOILERS) Geralt travels around through 4 books I believe, covering  wyzima, Cintra, brugge, rivia, the land of wine (sry, been a while since I read the books) in a lot of time, maybe some months, the books say that by the time Geralt gets to that last destination, he stays there for a whole month. I feel that since Geralt basically already covered the whole world in a few episodes, the search for ciri will feel wrong, artificial and I worry about it a lot. Anyway, I would love to read your opinions on this, if you have any.",

        "title": "SPECULATION - Season 3 and Time of Contempt (SPOILERS FOR BOOKS)",
        "body": "As many other viewers introduced to the Witcher by the show on Netflix, I've started reading the books. *Time of Contempt* might start slow but once the shit starts hitting the fan, it doesn't stop. I described the end to a friend as \"well.... every character is up shit creek now? And I can't wait to see how they get out of it\"\n\nWhat I'm wondering is what choices will be made in adapting TOC for season 3. We know there will be a lot of focus on Thanned because Lauren has confirmed on Twitter that she's very excited about adapting that. \n\nWhen I was reading the books, I remember thinking that the moment when Ciri wakes up in the desert would be an amazing cliff hanger for s3. It would mean bumping off a lot of Ciri's end of TOC adventures to s4, and frankly I'd love it if we don't have her being raped...\n\nIf we have 8 episodes, and bearing in mind the outstanding bits and pieces from *Blood of Elves* that were left aside: \n\n* When do we think Thanned will happen? I'm tipping Episode 7 will end with the start of the shit hitting the fan, and episode 8 will be Geralt fighting Djikstra and Cahir and Vilgefortz and getting wrecked. \n* Alternatively, if Thanned is earlier (e.g. episode 4?) then they could have some of Geralt's healing in Brokilion and Ciri's time with the Rats from *Baptism of Fire*\n* Plot threads outstanding from s2: \n   * Ciri, Geralt, Yen, Jaskier are all in Kaer Moran, so presumably they need to leave KM and travel - together or separately? Are we going to revisit Ciri and Yen at the Temple with Nenneke, or have Yen train Ciri at KM or on the road to Gors Velan? \n   * Introducing Phillipa. Yes, book readers know the owl person. Show has only just revealed that the owl *is* a mage person. \n   * *Time of Contempt* starts with the Northern kings planning to capture or kill Ciri - we've already had this scene, so that plot can start. We also have Rience and his mysterious benefactor. Presumably, early in s3 we need to see some further attempts from assassins or Rience to capture or kill Ciri before Thanned? \n   * The Wild Hunt: in *Time of Contempt* \\- when Ciri runs away from Gors Velan to meet up with Geralt as she doesn't want to go to Aretuza, she is chased by something that Geralt and Yen identify as the Wild Hunt. Just spectres at the moment, but still there. Then Thanned happens and everyone forgets about that moment, because they've got other shit to deal with. But with the Voleth Moir and Wild Hunt teaser in the finale of S2, we can have Ciri being chased by the Wild Hunt spectres in s3 and have it make more sense rather than being extremely random and confusing (as it was in the book, IMO). \n   * Djikstra calling Jaskier's debts due. This could be all the shenanigans at the University, although we've already had Geralt v Rience once in S2. Presumably the circumstances need to change, and maybe Yen will take over Phillipa's role in realising that Rience's portal linked to Vilgefortz? She knows that Vilgefortz is Tissiea's lover and confidant, so it would then give Yen a reason to attend Thanned and speak with Tissiea before the shit hits the fan to find out why Rience is connected to Vilgefortz?",

        "body": "**Expectation**: *Eskel’s character is ruined to the point of ruining the entire season, he is a horrible whoremongering bastard, it’s unforgivable butchery.*\n\n**Reality**: Eskel has about 10 minutes of screentime total, consisting mainly of him acting like a dick (to everyone’s alarm, implying that it’s not his normal behavior) because he’s infected by the leshy, and also a flashback explicitly illustrating that he used to be the sweetie everyone expected him to be. Eskel is largely irrelevant to the season aside from providing a bit of mild angst, and setting the scene for Vesemir going a bit bananas over the possibility of creating new witchers. Eskel is a nice character in the source material, but saying that him getting mostly cut out is a tragedy is a bit much.\n\n**Expectation**: *Vesemir’s character is ruined to the point of ruining the entire season, he acts completely out of character, he is cold and cruel, it’s unforgivable butchery.*\n\n**Reality**: The only thing wrong with Vesemir in S2 is that he has weaknesses, which I realize is unpalatable to the people who expected him to be a caricature of the Wise Grandpa archetype. He devoted his entire life to the witcher trade, and he can see it dying before his eyes. He’s freaking the fuck out, he *almost* made some bad decisions (which are explicitly portrayed as bad), and he’s seen wrestling with his consciousness. The horror.\n\n**Expectation**: *Witchers are loud boors with one brain cell between them, when they’re supposed to be a friendly band of brothers and give everyone warm feels. Lambert does nothing except bully everyone and is a total dick.*\n\n**Reality**: Background witchers aren’t given a lot of exposition either way. They drink and swear, but like… Are they not supposed to do that when they’re chilling at home lol? Lambert is bitter and picks on people (which is hardly news for anyone), but apologizes when he crosses the line (he apologized to both Triss and Ciri when he hurt them inadvertently). Lambert pushed Ciri rather meanly on the training course, but genuinely cheered for her when she responded positively to the tough love and was eager to prove she’s more than meets the eye. Coen is a completely benign figure. The portrayal of witchers as a whole is largely unproblematic.\n\n**Expectation**: *Yennefer acts like a total bitch the entire season, she’s purely selfish and overall wholly unpleasant, she tried to sacrifice Ciri in cold blood when she’s supposed to love her like a daughter. Yennefer has too much screentime. Yennefer carries the banner for the woke feminist agenda. Her character is irredeemable and ruined.*\n\n**Reality**: Yennefer spends the entire season completely torn up over losing what made her, *her*. Despite that, she bravely saves Jaskier, risking her life and missing the ship she went through so much to get to, for no reason other than because she simply doesn’t want him to die. She has no one to turn to and she feels broken, her mind is fully fucked by Voleth Meir, her ability to think clearly wanes more and more as the season goes on, she’s lost and in pain, and she – VERY reluctantly – gives in to the very human impulse to do a horrible thing just to make it all stop. She literally just met Ciri, she would be allowed to have zero feelings for Ciri, she has no basis for maternal feelings yet nor is she obligated to even really care beyond not wanting to hurt Geralt, which she doesn’t – and despite all that she very clearly does care about Ciri’s well-being from the very beginning, and even more so later on, and hates that her choice is between betrayal and entirely sacrificing her own agency forever by forgoing what she at that point believes is the only way of regaining her powers. She chooses herself, and she regrets it before she even steps through that portal in the temple. Her entire journey with Ciri is filled with palpable grief, regret and self-hatred because her own actions repulse her and she loathes hurting Geralt and Ciri. She can’t go through with it, and she will be paying for this moment of weakness for a long time.\n\n**Expectation**: *Jaskier is supposed to be Geralt’s best friend in the whole wide world, but for some unfathomable reason he hates Geralt now. He gives away Geralt’s secrets to Rience. Jaskier’s character is ruined.*\n\n**Reality**: Jaskier loves Geralt and very justifiably feels betrayed by him because Geralt acted like an absolute shithead and totally deserved to be put on blast with that song. Jaskier, a gentle artist, is brutally tortured by Rience for a long time and gives away fuck all. He joyfully reconciles with Geralt the second he has a chance to and follows him into danger without a second thought. Enough said, really.\n\nThere’s more, of course. About Nilfgaard, the elves, the Brotherhood… But, bottom line: I fully expected to see a freakshow of completely one-dimensional, butchered characters who are all completely awful and unrecognizable. What I saw instead were characters battling their inner demons in a very understandable way. I’m glad that that’s how it played out for me, but I’m alarmed at just how vacuous most of the critique I’ve been exposed to (primarily on this sub) ended up being.\n\nThat’s not to say the season is flawless, not at all. There are legitimate things to criticize about each character, although I'd say most of them aren't *that* serious. On top of that, all characters often act like they have a stick up their ass, they act *written*, not real. The whole season is horribly unfunny, the only relief is Jaskier and even he has only one “bumbling idiot” comedic act that gets recycled over and over; everyone else is just totally solemn all the time. Ciri and Tissaia cry pretty much every other time they’re seen on screen, they both must be severely dehydrated by now, I mean it’s like the writers think that unless a character sheds at least two tears, the audience can’t possibly pick up on the fact that they’re going through some shit? \n\nAnd sure, there are some plot holes and the characterization is weak in places. There are cringey moments. It’s not by any means a perfect show and I wouldn’t even say it’s a great one, aside from Henry Cavill god bless him. But it’s really not as terrible as it would seem from common points of criticisn.",

        "title": "Netflix’s Jaskier Was A Bad Friend Who Needs To Take Responsibility For His Part In Their Falling Out",
        "body": "Before I possibly get crucified, I quite enjoy Jaskier on Netflix. He’s funny, petty, and good comic relief. His loud personality is a great contrast to Geralt’s and a lot of their interactions are entertaining AF. \n\nBut. Ever since Geralt and Jaskier split in S1, I have heard nothing but hate towards Geralt for leaving his best friend, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to him, alone on a mountain to die. “Jaskier deserves more.” “Geralt needs to do more to earn his forgiveness.” “Jaskier did nothing wrong. Geralt was a bad friend.” \n\n\nThis is where I must interject: Jaskier wasn’t much better. \n\nThe first time we met Jaskier, he went out of his way to invade the space of a man who so obviously wanted to be alone. Then he purposefully outed him in front of everyone at the bar.  Geralt is uncomfortable. Geralt doesn’t want to be the center of attention. But Jaskier sees none of this; he sees only what he wants to see: the mysterious majestic bloodthirsty BUTCHER OF BLAVIKA. \n\nAnd this sentiment follows him into every interaction they share. Jaskier insists on making Geralt his muse so his songs can be famous, disguising it as an offer of good PR. Geralt neither needs nor wants that. Jaskier doesn’t care. \n\nWhen they get captured by the elves, Jaskier shows his ignorance of elven history, before being passionately corrected. He witnesses Geralt reason with the elves, even empathize with them, until they set both him and Jaskier free. And then he starts making a promo song about Geralt defeating the evil bloodthirsty elves, this “friend of humanity” conquering an already hated species. Geralt himself dislikes this. Jaskier doesn’t care. “Respect doesn’t make history.” \n\nWhen Geralt is fishing for a Djinn to help him get some damn SLEEP, Jaskier talks his ear off and then gets offended when Geralt implies his dislikes Jaskier’s musical lies about his conquests. Jaskier so so far as to take the Djinn vase to get Geralt to take back his comments, then commences to engage in a tug-of-war with him (What are we, four?)  after which the jar opens…and Jaskier’s first instinct is to demand all three wishes for himself, and smash the fucking jar to the ground when Geralt tells him to stop. Thereby landing himself at death door when he gets cursed, which Geralt goes the extra mile to lift. \n\n\nJaskier has this man body guarding him from all the Lords whose wives he slept with, and spends Geralt’s bathtime insisting he’s his “best friend in the whole world” and calling the man’s livelihood “monster-hunting nonsense.” You know, that nonsense that has helped make Jaskier popular. But I digress. \n\nJaskier and Geralt’s relationship is one of willful ignorance and imposition. Jaskier imposed himself one day on Geralt to be his PR singer for his own wants, and he’s been imposing ever since. He ignores what Geralt says and does to indicate he doesn’t want something, and decides to do that thing anyway. He imposes his fantasy of a towering badass on a man who already sees himself as a monster. He talks over the other guy’s clear dissent 24/7, and gets surprised when Geralt finally snaps after another tone deaf comment. \n\nOf course, Geralt was dead wrong to put all his pain on Jaskier. He was angry and hurt and lashing out at someone when he shouldn’t have. We just can’t deny that it was a long time coming. \n\nGeralt wasn’t mean. He was tired. He was tired of this one sided codependent relationship whose purpose was to make Jaskier’s music the talk of the town, even when so many of them were embellished to the point of lies (like the very first one). They frankly needed the space from each other, and while it sucks how it happened, it was necessary. \n\nBut then again, it probably didn’t do much, because Jaskier is still out here singing self-pity songs about how he did everything for Geralt and got nothing in return. \n\nLook at these lyrics:\n\n> Did I not bring you some glee,\n>Mister \"oh! oh-look-at-me\"?\n\nWhen was Geralt ever Mister “Oh look at me?” When? We watched 8 episodes of him trying to be the exact opposite!\n\n> After everything we did, we saw,\n>You turned your back on me\n\nThis revisionist history. It is exactly everything the two of you went through that led to Geralt eventually turning his back on you. \n\n\n>What for d'you yearn?\n\n\nHe told you thousands of times what he yearned for, you just didn’t listen. You assumed you knew better and acted on that delusion. \n\n\n>Watch that butcher burn\n\nThis is just petty and nasty, given Geralt’s conflicted feelings about that name and how it was given to him. It’s Jaskier lashing out in hurt, and going below the belt to do it. \n\nAnd someone, when he finds Yen, we are expected to watch them commiserate over Geralt and see their situations as the same; two people fucked over by Geralt. Yen could make a case for that despite him saving her life. But Jaskier is a different story and we all know it. While Yen hates the thought that she might need Geralt, Jaskier hates the notion that Geralt never needed him. It’s all built around his self-absorbed need to be needed, at the cost of what Geralt actually said he wanted. \n\nOnly time will tell if Jaskier has grown from the way he used to be, and the two men can start from scratch with a friendship that is rooted in the reality of who they are and acceptance of each other. But one thing is for certain: Geralt didn’t *happen* to Jaskier. It takes two to tango, and Jaskier was dragging Geralt across the floor until he finally pushed him away. Trying to victimize him and romanticize the toxic relationship they shared in season 1 takes responsibility away from Jaskier’s part in their friendship’s demise, and as a grown man, he doesn’t need that kind of protection. \n\nIf either one of them want to be friend again, it starts with both sides acknowledging their fuckups and promising to do better, not just one side groveling for the other. \n\n**TL;DR: Jaskier is not an innocent victim of Geralt’s asshole behavior; he was pushy, willfully ignorant and selfish, and those issues led to their downfall. If they want a real friendship, they have to take responsibility for BOTH their roles in this mess. Especially Jaskier.**\n\n\nWhew. I had to get that off my chest.",

He takes more damage than his armour. Is he protecting it with his body?\n\nOthers wear helmets and breastplates which have no effect on anyone's weapons, being cut through with ease. Surely part of combat skill is hitting your opponent where their armour is weak. If something like a breastplate - which should be where the armour is strongest - provides no protection, then you don't need much skill.",

In the books, Francesca never has a baby that ends up killed. \n\nWhat I'm curious about are the sub's opinions on how this will develop across the future seasons - obviously, it's a big chance that's going to have an impact down the road. Because of his manipulations, Francesca has killed hundreds of children and declared war on humanity in the act. \n\nObviously, she has to be involved at Thanedd down the road in some manner which is why I don't think she'll find out about Emhyr's involvement until afterwards, but what is going to happen then, in your opinion? She's far too powerful to sit idly with the lodge and not take revenge.\n\nWhich is what brings me to my question - what sort of consequence could this storyline have down the road? Is she going to go after Ciri and try to kill her as revenge for Emhyr doing the same to her child? Or do you think it'll take more seasons until she finds out about his involvement at all? Clearly there will be a personal beef between the two of them that the writers will have to resolve at some point. \n\nIn the books, their alliance was political, but the show made it much more complicated by adding in Emhyr's plot.",

        "body": "Okay, so I just finished season 2 last night, and I'm so confused about one aspect of it that basically driving me crazy. I tried googling and searching on reddit for a couple hours seeking answers, but I came up empty handed. I did find multiple sites and threads that attempted to explain the reveal, but all I could find are half explanations that don't really go into detail about why certain things are happening the way they are. I'll put the rest in spoiler tags. All the info I have is basically from the show up to the end of Season 2.\n\n>!Okay, so at the end of Season 2, its revealed that Duny is still alive and is Emhyr / The White Flame. He's the Emperor of Nilfgaard and he's attacking Cintra to get Ciri back. Okay...!<\n\n>!So, why the hell doesn't he just go back to Cintra peacefully and tell Ciri he's alive and he wants to be in her life? Seems much easier than starting a war to get her back.!<\n\n>!In my search for answers, I did see some book spoilers that basically Emhyr has a much darker plot with Ciri that probably won't be talked about on the show. But even with this explanation, I still have questions:!<\n\n1. >!What age was Ciri with Pavetta and Duny supposedly die at sea? (I ask this because I'm wondering if she has a memory of what her parents look like. If she was old enough to remember what they look like, when Duny returns, she would probably be very happy. However if she was just a baby, its understandable that Calanthe is all she has even known, so she would be hesitant to go with him.!<\n2. >!I've seen conflicting reports on if Duny/Emhyr is evil and killed Pavetta on purpose, or if it was really an accident. Which is it?!<\n3. >!If it was an accident, you'd think he could return to Cintra and tell Calanthe about it. Especially if the accident was years after Ciri was born. I know Calanthe hated him at first, but it seems that after years passed she would have softened on him and probably accepted him as Ciri's father.!<\n4. >!If it was on purpose, or really Calanthe just hates him and would keep Ciri for herself, then why wouldn't he just sneak into Cintra with a disguise, and wait for Ciri to be playing Knucklebones outside and then go up to her like \"hey Ciri I'm alive!\".!<\n5. >!If he couldn't go into Cintra cause he'd be recognized or killed, they why wouldn't he just send a messenger to find Ciri and tell him he was still alive and he wants to see her?!<\n6. >!Although you may think some of these options may be hard for him to pull off, l think all of them seem easier than taking an entire kingdom to war and killing thousands of people just to get his daughter back.!<\n\n>!I guess that's it. I just really can't wrap my head around why he's using war to get to Ciri instead of the seemingly MUCH easier options to get her back. Even if its more like the book explanation of his evil plot, it still seems much easier to just dupe her with a nice guy act and get her back peacefully before you execute your super evil plot.!<\n\nCan anyone help explain this to me? Thank you so much in advance!\n\nAlso I've never posted here before. I wanted that spoiler tag to apply to the whole thing with just one click, but it made every paragraph a separate spoiler that had to be clicked. Sorry! I assumed this should be in spoiler tags though. Let me know if I did it correctly or if they can be removed. :)",

        "body": "(Not a reader of the books and never played the games. I'm 100% judging the show on its own merits and not making comparisons to prior material. Sorry for the longpost.)\n\nWhat the heck happened in the last 3 episodes? Yen was one of, if not THE best written character in S1. The start of her arc this season was strong. She struggled with identity and legacy last season, only to have BOTH stripped away at the start of this season. That's powerful stuff to work with right there. And up to the end of episode 5, I was down for it.\n\nBut then her relationship with Ciri, the intended catalyst to wrap up her arc, is somehow less developed than Geralt's relationship with Roach. What the heck happened? How did the show devote more plot real estate to the friendships of its side characters (ex: Francesca and Fringilla) than to the proper development and instigation of its ***main cast's*** relationships? Not to mention one of the most important relationships in the franchise as a whole. As a result, the culmination of her personal growth and her affection for Ciri felt entirely unearned and completely removed the investment I had in both characters. (Also the whole \"friendship trumps hate\" ending was ***really*** trite, good lord.)\n\nHow did that happen? Why did Netflix feel the need to constrain such a MASSIVE GoT-esque series of plots and subplots to 8 episodes? That was by far and away the biggest weakness of this season; they bit off more than they could chew, and it ***really*** shows in the last 3 episodes. Most of the season's catalytic events occurred in, like, 2 episodes. Yikes. As a result, its characters suffered massively. Yen's not nearly the only casualty, she's just the one I'm most personally frustrated with given how much I liked her in season 1.\n\nNetflix. This show is your flagship franchise. Start treating it that way. Give it the episodes it needs to breathe, good lord. When this season took a second to slow the heck down and develop its characters, it was great. But every time we changed locations and rapid-fired between subplots, it gave me whiplash. I ***know*** this creative team can make good episodes and characters. They've done it before. So what happened this time? Whose format are the execs trying to mimic with this 8-episode thing? Certainly not GoT's. And everyone saw how well that show performed (barring the last season.)\n\nSigh. I'm consciously choosing to remain optimistic for season 3, but boy were those last 3 episodes rough.\n\nOne more side nitpick about Yen: I was disappointed to see that the culmination of her arc had nothing to do with fire. She's been overtly thematically linked with fire since early s1, so it felt inappropriate to not tie it in somehow to how her character grows. I'm fine with overt imagery where appropriate, and this felt like one of those times when it should've been present.",

        "title": "I went from show to books and now I understand...",
        "body": "I played the Witcher games a long time ago and didn't really remember much of the story, but I remembered that I liked them. When I saw Netflix put out a show, I binged it pretty quick.  I really liked season 1.  I even liked season 2, but not as much as the first season.  However, I saw lots of critique online from people about how bad season 2 was compared to the books and how they botched so many characters and plot lines.  This confused me (since I liked season 2 on first watch), so I purchased all the books and started reading... now I understand.  I am about half way through Time of Contempt and read the previous 3 in the order of Last Wish, Sword of Destiny, and then Blood of Elves, so beware of spoilers up to that point.\n\nI do find the books much better, especially for certain characters and story lines. This has made me confused about the show and where it plans to go and how they plan to develop characters.  The way they've written the story and developed many of the characters kind of prevents them from using some of the stuff from the books (some of the best stuff IMO I might add).\n\nI liked Blood of Elves and I'm surprised they didn't use more of it in the show because you really learn more about some of the characters and develop a stronger care for them than you do in the show.  I'm also kind of a sad because based on how season 2 went vs the books, I don't see how they can incorporate all the events I've read in Time of Contempt - which has been a pretty wild ride so far, the whole wizard banquet/conclave event was especially fun.\n\nSome of the differences I've noticed:\n\n* Book Yennefer is a total boss. She's calm, composed, and you do not mess with her - show version somewhat matched that in season 1, but now they have a very different version of her.  She also never loses her magic nor betrays the mages by freeing the Nilfgaard guy (at least not yet as far as I've read) - thus I imagine that cancels any possibility of attending the conclave/banquet with Geralt and all the interesting conversations and events that happened there.\n* Dandelion/Jaskier is held in much higher regard in the books and he has a much better relationship with Geralt.\n* Vilgefortz in the books seems way stronger.  He whoops the shit of Geralt with ease.  The show version had trouble beating the Nilfgaard knight.  When I read that part, I had to google who played him in the show to make sure I was thinking of the right person. The show will have a hard time selling him as someone capable of beating Geralt if that's the road they plan to go.\n* The elves and Fringilla are way different from the books it seems.\n* Ciri is a lot different in the books and so is the relationships between her, Yennefer, and Geralt.\n* Triss and Istredd are different...\n* Season 2 was pretty much made up past the first episode as far as I can tell.\n\nI'm sure there are many other differences, but those are some of the more notable ones off the top of my head.  Henry Cavill is the perfect Witcher though. Anyway, I just don't see how they can reconnect with the books.\n\nRight now, it kind of feels like they have to pretty much create a completely new story.   Don't get me wrong, I'll still watch the show and probably like it, but I was just curious if they have set any expectations as far as storylines.  If they continue to diverge, then I guess I'll just think of it as just a different story all together and pretend they are not related.  I don't really follow show announcements or interviews or anything like that, so I guess I wanted to know if they've said if they plan to use more of the book material or not?  After reading this far, I just really want to see some of the book scenes play out.",

        "body": "The netflix version of Fringilla, an absolutely different character from the books appart from her nationality and occupation as a sorceress, has had her share of criticism. Some don't like her acting, her storyline, or have... other reasons to be enraged by her character. Can't really argue with that, it's mostly subjective. However, something that is sometimes said and that I do not agree with at all is that she has no personality, no arc, and is a flat character. I think that Fringilla is one of the few secondary protagonist through 2 seasons who get a rather thorough exploration of what guides her through life.\n\nWe get a glimpse of it in season 1, where she went from boasting about being glad to be denied the easy path of being sent to a cushy job in Aedirn, only to reveal her bitterness later to Tissaia, having embraced the cause of Emhyr partly by loyalty and partly as a \"fuck you\" to the northern society she couldn't integrate.\n\nBut it gets really developped in season 2, in wich it's made clear that her time in Nilfgaard under the Usurper was far worse than what anyone expected, with her and other mages locked in the \"Playhouse\", where things so horrible happened to her that she'd rather die rather than go back. She seems to have restructured her ego around being one of Emhyr's True Companions in his fairytale-like \"return of the rightful king\". She found a way to attach her pride to submissiveness to his cause, and as a result, became one of his most loyal and powerful servant.\n\nHowever, as Voleth Meir found out and exploited, Fringilla is not really satisfied with her fate. She still wants to decide things and act on her own volition, and she also has a lingering loneliness that seems to weigh on her (I can't imagine Emhyr to be the most cuddly person, and Fringilla is very quick to chat with her rival Yennefer, and to get far more personal than needed with Francesca). These traits lead her to attempt the prototype of the scoia'tel project, much to the scorn of the rest of the local imperial hierarchy. When it seems to collapse on her, she desperately attempts to go back to her uncle at Aretuza.\n\nArtorius is sympathetic, but also completely direct about how much he doesn't think much of her abilities, and the hand he offers her comes with the shattering of everything Fringilla told herself to build back her pride after the Usurper's reign. She's just a girl that should have gotten an easy job because she couldn't do better and was never meant to wield political power. Her ego can't handle that, and she gives up her last chance to go back in the ranks and murder her opponents in Cintra instead. Wich, as we'll see, happens to be a bad choice.\n\nFringilla is rather multi-layered. She's devoted, but proud, ruthless, but vulnerable, driven, but insecure. I really want to see what they'll do with her in later seasons.",

When King Ervyll showed mercy to a young merchant of Verden, who was sentenced to death, the merchant offered him the Law of Surprise as payment, but not for him but for his youngest son, Demond. The merchant's wife gave birth to a daughter who was named Enira. Enira was a child of surprise and a gift that had to be claimed from Prince Demond in the future. King Ervyll made it clear though that he couldn't let his son marry a simple girl. \n\n\nEnira was a very impressive, attractive and beautiful girl. She had dark brown hair, white skin and rare violet eyes. She was always kind, friendly, smart, open hearted and very stubborn. She also had shown some signs, that she could conguate chaos but she kept it to herself. \nWhen Enira was 16 years old she met and fell in love with Prince Demond as he felt the same. Their bond was strong, warm and full of truth but they knew that they couldn't just announce to their parents that they wanted to marry. \n\nThey had an affair for one whole year. \nMany boys loved Enira and Demond was about to be engaged with a lady named Sybilla.\n\nThere was a time when Enira felt so insecure  with Demond's engagement and she finally decided to claim the power that is required, by using her chaos and go to Aretuza and finally be with Demond. \nShe run away from Verden shortly after and she arrived to Aretuza. \n\nDemond went to look for her and he was searching the content every day in any kind of weather. \n\n\nFor one whole year Aretuza, where she was taugh magic, Enira became a valuable sorceress and with Tissaia's help she was going to ascend and go to Verden's court. For a moment Enira was happy but then she realized that she couldn't marry Demond if she was just the sorceress in Ervyll's side. She wanted to leave Aretuza but Tissaia couldn't let her and she felt doomed and grieved that she wouldn't see her lover again.\n\n\nWhen Yennefer of Vengerverg arrived in Aretuza, before the battle of Sodden she met Enira and they became friends. \n\nEnira explained her problem to Yennefer and because she knew well that Enira wouldn't find what she wanted in Aretuza she agreed to secretly take her with her in Sodden and help her escape and go to Verden. \n\n(Season 2 facts to be continued)",

        "title": "Review: A Different Flesh by Harry Turtledove",
        "body": "I've discussed this before, but a plenty of times I really want to listen to a book, but it just won't be available for various reasons.  Of course, over the years, my patience has been rewarded in some very big ways.  Case in point, the book we're going to be reviewing today.  We're going to be taking a look at [A Different Flesh by Harry Turtledove](https://www.amazon.com/Different-Flesh-Harry-Turtledove/dp/1504052331)\n\nA Different Flesh is a collection of short stories set in the same universe.  In the world of A Different Flesh, the ancestors of the Native Americans never crossed the Bering land bridge during the Ice Age.  However, Homo Erectus did cross into the Americas.  Thus, when the Europeans discover the Americas, they don't find any Native American civilizations, but they do find tribes of Homo Erectus, whom they refer to as sims.  Also, the Ice Age megafauna of the Americas never went extinct, so the Europeans also discover a land full of woolly mammoths, sabertooth cats, giant ground sloths, and giant armadillos among other things.  \n\nThe stories follow the history of the Federated Commonwealths of America, this world's equivalent of the United States of America.  Before the start of each story, the mood is set with an excerpt from a book about the history of the FCA.  It also provides great details about the history of this world that don't quite make it into the stories.  The excerpts also chronicle the relationship between humans and sims.  \n\nWe're going to take a look at each of the stories individually, but I'm going to give some overall thoughts first.  Well, I can most certainly say that this book was well worth the wait.  Harry Turtledove says that he got the idea for this series when he read an article by the late great paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould.  Gould pondered what might have happened if John Smith and the Jamestown colonists had discovered Australopithecus rather than Native Americans in Virginia.  Gould concluded that it would not have ended well for Australopithecus.  Turtledove certainly seems to have come to the same conclusion.  One thing I think he did well was that, though he wrote the sims as sympathetic, he never made them too anthropomorphized.  You can definitely see similarities between humans and sims, as is to be expected, but at the same time sims clearly act and think differently than humans. \n\nThe first story is called \"Vilest Beast\" and is set in Jamestown, Virginia in the year 1610.  Without the Native Americans and their corn, the colonists are having an even hard time than they did in our world.  Despite this, Edward Wingfield and his wife Anne are making the best of things.  Things change when their infant daughter Joanna is kidnapped by a tribe of sims.  Edward must lead a search party to get her back. \n\nGiven what inspired these stories, it's fitting that the first should take place in Jamestown.  Speaking which, we learn how things went with John Smith and the Sims.  It ended badly...for John Smith.  Apparently, the sims killed him in 1607, and his death was a considerable blow to the moral of the colony.  Overall, I would say the way Turtledove portrays the sims still holds up based on what we know about Homo Erectus.  There's never called Homo Erectus in any of the stories, but Turtledove has confirmed this is the case in interviews.  Also, the excerpt from the text book mentions that sim fossils have been discovered in East Africa, South China, and the island of Java.  All of which are places Homo Erectus fossils have been found.  \n\nIt might come across as a bit silly that they're called sims, but how was Turtledove to know that there would one day be a video game called The Sims?  These stories were written between 1985-1988, with A Different Flesh being published in 1988.  I'm guessing it was intended to be short for simians, or something like that.  \n\nAlso, fun fact, Edward Wingfield was a real person who existed in our world.  I've got to admit, this story hooked me from the start.  I've always been fascinated by the colonization of the Americas, especially the different ways it often plays out in alternate history.  I'm also a big paleontology fan, so this story was kind of a match made in heaven.  Really, the whole book was kind of like that.  I found it realistic that the colonist struggled more without corn to supplement their diets.  It can't be stressed enough what a difference corn made to the early colonization of the Americas.  Curiously, later stories make mention of a colony in Massachusetts, which is called Plymouth in this world because Massachusetts got its name from the Native Americans.  Obviously, this means the Pilgrims still happened, but without any corn they would have been completely screwed. \n\nAnyway, I loved how the story resolves.  >!Turns out the sims took Joanna because they wanted to learn more about the colonists by studying one of their young.  By all accounts, the sims treated Joanna no differently than one of their own young!< Edward spends most of the story viewing the sims as nothing more than wild animals, but after this, he starts to realize they aren't so different.  He even briefly worries about what's going to happen to the sims as the European continue to colonize the New World.  All in all, \"Vilest Beast\" is a great start to the collection. \n\nThe next story is called \"And So To Bed\".  It is set in 1661 and is told in the form of the diary of Samuel Pepys.  He's a figure from our world, a great English statesman, and the Pepys of our world is indeed famous for his diary.  In the world of A Different Flesh, however, Pepys' diary holds a different significance.  He notes that there is a clear link between chimps, Sims and humans.  He wonders if there's some process that slowly changes life over time. \n\nThis was one of the weaker stories, but it has some interesting ideas.  It makes sense that the Theory of Evolution was developed earlier.  Sims are an obvious link between humans and animals.  It was also fun to learn about a historical figure I'd never heard of before.  Well, anyway, moving right along. \n\nThe third story is titled \"Around the Salt Lick\".  It takes place in the year 1691 and follows a scout named Thomas Kenton and his loyal sim companion Charles.  Thomas is hunting spearfang cats for their valuable fangs.  Spearfang cats have gotten a bit rare in Virginia, so Thomas and Charles have had to push into the frontier to find the bounty.  However, things get a bit complicated when they come into conflict with a tribe of wild sims.  \n\nThis one was maybe not my favorite, but not too bad either.  I did find it funny at the end where Charles turns out to be snobby towards wild sims.  He views them much the same as humans do.  We learn that sims can communicate via sign language, but not vocal speech.  The excerpt from the history book provides more worldbuilding hints.  Apparently, England adopted the Divine Right of Kings model of government.  People who objected to this moved to America in droves.  This would suggest that the English Civil War never happened in this world.  Well, that or maybe the Royalist won.  Also, apparently Spain had a much harder time colonizing the New World without the Aztec and Inca to conquer.  By the time of \"Around the Salt Lick\" they've only got two successful colonies: Argentina and New Grenada. \n\nArgentina makes sense, because it has a fairly European climate, but New Grenada?  That was in Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador in our world.  Unless it was somewhere else, that makes a bit less sense, especially since it is said Spain struggled to colonize the tropics without any corn.  Also, without Aztec and Incan gold and silver, Spain would have a harder time financing their wars in Europe.  That would potentially mean the European History took some very different turns.  Of course, that might explain what happened in England.  Turtledove is mostly focused on stories about the sims, but he's certainly lead tantalizing hints at a wider world.\n\nThe fourth story is titled \"The Iron Elephant\" and is set in 1782.  Hairy elephants play a major role in the Federated Commonwealths of America.  They haul passenger carriages and freight cars all across the nation.  However, this time-honored institution is facing competition from the new invention of steam-powered locomotives.  A race has been organized between a team of mammoth drivers and a train engineer.  Can flesh and blood triumph over iron and steam?  \n\nYeah, this one is sort of an alternate history retelling of the legend of John Henry.  John Henry is my favorite American Folk Hero, so I'm not complaining.   We get even more worldbuilding here.  Apparently, in order to tame the wooly mammoths, America started importing elephant trainers from India.  The protagonist of the story, Premier Chand, is descended from these.  Also, the Federated Commonwealths got their independence in 1732, so the American Revolution happened earlier.  This story appear to be set in Illinois based on mention of Cairo (pronounced Kay-Roe) and the New Nile is obviously the Mississippi River.  Again, no Native Americans, so it isn't called Illinois.  I guess that means Chicago, if it exists, is named something else as well.  It's kind of amazing how many places in America get their names from the Native Americans.  \n\nAs fascinating as the world of A Different Flesh is, not sure I'd wanted to live there.  True, I'd get to see all sorts of Ice Age animals, but it would be a poorer world without the richness of Native American culture.  Also, I have a small amount of Native American ancestry, so I would not exist in the world of A Different Flesh.  \n\nIt's interesting that this story features sims the least of all the stories in the collection.  Oh, but they're not absent from this story.  The sims appear towards the end of the story, and they're are the ones who get the last laugh in the big race.  Without giving too much away, I can say it shows that sims are smarter than they are given credit for.  \"The Iron Elephant\" is another great story in the collection. \n\nThe fifth story is titled \"Though Heavens Fall\" and takes places in 1804.  From the textbook excerpt we learn that Americans used sims as laborers on plantations and farms.  This blunted the Transatlantic Slave Trade to a large extent, but didn't completely prevent it.  Africans were brought to America as slaves, but most of them wound up as house slaves.  Sims make terrible housekeepers, apparently.  The story follows a slave named Jeremiah.  He's got a pretty good life on the Gillen plantation in Virginia.  Still, he dreams of the day he saves up enough money to buy his freedom.  Unfortunately, the sims have recently come down with an illness, and Jeremiah gets sends to the fields to supplement the work force.  After a day of hard labor he decides to make a run for it try his luck in Portsmouth, Virginia.  He takes up residence with lawyer Alfred Douglas, and together they set out to put the institution of slavery on trial.  The outcome of the trail will impact not just Jeremiah, but Black Americans as a whole.\n\nI think this was possibly my favorite story of the bunch.  Well, \"Vilest Beast\" was pretty good too, but it is tied with \"Though Heavens Fall\".  I think the way slavery was depicted made sense.  Slavery has existed as far back as Ancient Mesopotamia, and I don't think sims would completely element it.  The Greeks and Romans believed in human-like creatures such satyrs, cyclopes, and centaurs, yet they still had slavery.  Still, as is noted in the story, people would have to recognize that a white person has far more in common with a black person than with a sim.  \n\nEven before the trails you can kind of see that the characters have kind of figured this out.  Mr. Gillen treats Jeremiah almost like an employee rather than a slave, and seems almost apologetic when he has to send Jeremiah to the fields.  Still, the overseer makes it clear that he has nothing but contempt for Jeremiah, and black people as a whole.  Moreover, Jeremiah is under no delusions that he is anything other than a slave.  On the flip side, I enjoyed how Jeremiah and Alfred's relationship developed.  They start off as employee and employer, but soon develop a genuine friendship with one another. \n\nWe also get a glimpse into the legal and political system of the Federated Commonwealths.  Apparently, courts use three judges, one senior judge and two junior judges, for trials.  Two of the three judges must agree for a verdict to pass.  Also, the government of the Federated Commonwealths is bi-cameral legislature divided into the Popular Assembly and the Senate.  Popular Assembly is directly elected by the people, while the Senate is made of former governors and censors who serve lifetime terms.  At the top of the government are the two censors.  They are elected by the people and serve a single five-year term.  The thinking is that they'll keep each other in check, especially if they're from opposing parities.  As you can see, the Conscript Fathers of the Federated Commonwealths modeled the nation very closely on the Roman Republic.  \n\nI also noticed some similarities to British Parliament, but that makes sense.  We know that America got a lot of political refugees after England adopted the Divine Right of Kings.  That means that ideas of parliamentary government were floating around in America.  Some of those ideas probably got incorporated into the fabric of the Federated Commonwealths.  It also turns out that sims can speak, but it takes a considerable amount of effort, and they can only say like one or two simple words at a time.  This is why they use sign language.  \n\nThere's a really great scene at the end where Jeremiah is mean to sim that bumps into him on the street.  He knows he's being kind of a dick, but he also knows that blacks would be at the bottom of society if the sims didn't exist.  All in all, a really great addition to A Different Flesh.\n\nThe penultimate story is titled \"Trapping Run\".  It is set in the Rocky Mountains in 1814 and follows a trapper named Henry Quick.  During a trapping run he gets attacked by a bear, but fortunately, a tribe of sims find him and nurse him back to health.  Quick has always though to the sims as nothing more than animals, but spending so much time with them allows Quick to see them as something almost human. \n\nThis one took me a but to get into, but I did enjoy it once it took off.  I guess you could say that Quick was really having some Dances with Sims after his leg healed.  Also, from this story we learn that sims and humans can indeed have hybrid children.  I really did enjoy how Quick came to view the sims as more human as the story went on.  He apparently goes on to become the founder of the Sims Justice Movement.  As we learn in the next story, Henry Quick became quite famous among the sims because of this.  Well, I think that's enough for this one, let's move on.\n\nThe final story is called \"Freedom\" and is set in 1988.  Over the years, sims have been used in all sorts of scientific research, including AIDS research.  The story follows a sim named Matt.  He's a teat subject at the AIDS research center in Terminus, Georgia.  Overall, he's got a pretty cushy life with plenty of food, females, and regular injections of HIV inhibitor than suppress his symptoms and make him feel like he doesn't have HIV at all.  Maybe he's not technically free, but he's not complaining.  However, a group of sims rights activists disagrees and decide to kidnap him to set him free.  Of course, as they soon discover, this is easier said than done. \n\nThe collection began on a strong note, and it certainly ends on a strong note as well.  A recusing theme throughout A Different Flesh is about what it means to be humans.  Sims are far more intelligent than most animals, but aren't quite at human levels of intelligence.  This certainly creates a moral conundrum about their place in society.  Even the sims rights activists acknowledge that sims will never, for example, be elected to public office.  Before we get to anything else, let's address the city name.  Terminus is the A Different Flesh version of Atlanta, Georgia.  It might seem odd that this is the case, given that Atlanta is from Classic Mythology, and wouldn’t be impacted by the lack of Native Americans.  However, Terminus was indeed the original name of the city.  It was changed in 1732, when the colonial governor of Georgia renamed the city after his daughter.  We know that the alternate American Revolution happened in 1732, or else that’s when America officially became independent.  So, that means the rename never happened.  That, or the Americans refused to acknowledge the name change. \n\nAnyway, the Sims Rights activists kind of reminded me of certain more extreme animal rights groups.  I'm talking PETA and their ilk.  Given that this was written in 1988, I can't help but wonder if Turtledove had that in mind.  The activist are certainly well intentioned, but they clearly didn't think things through, and you know what they say about the road to hell.  They have a hard time convincing Matt not to have sex with other sims, lest he give them HIV, and they don't bring nearly enough HIV inhibitor.  So, in the end, they have to return him to the AIDS research center. \n\nFrom the excerpt we learn that sims were used as slave labor in factories, and that many displaced factory workers lead sims rights movements.  However, they did this less because they cared about sims, and more because they didn't like that the sims were taking their jobs.  It's interesting that they helped the sims, but not necessarily for altruistic reasons.  Also, apparently the FCA equivalent of NASA used sims to test their spacecrafts.  \n\nAnother theme in this story is about how a freedom is relative and subjective.  The activist think they're freeing Matt, but they're way more restrictive and stifling than the institute ever was.  In the end, Matt's happy to return to the institute.  I especially liked the end where the other sims ask him what it was like outside.  He says that it isn't like on TV, and that the activist are like all the other humans; they only care about sims when it serves their personal goals. The story ends on a bittersweet note.  Matt is happy and back home, but the future of sims remains uncertain.  True, it is mentioned that there are three major reserves the size of moderate sized states, but the sims are also losing their habitats to development and the continued encroachment of humans.  And, as mentioned, there's the question of just how do that fit into society.  Both issues have been pretty consistent across all the stories, and I guess it just goes to show that, the more things change, the more they stay the same. \n\nEnding on a bittersweet note seems pretty realistic to me.  A lot of times, bittersweet is the best you can hope for in real life.  But hey, that's history for you.  \n\nBefore we wrap things up I've got to talk about [the audiobook edition that is here](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Different-Flesh-Audiobook/B07LHHLH4M?qid=1554434486&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=T4X2XN5J2VBTWW5JCTVF) at long last.  It is narrated by Paul Woodson.  He's equally adept at pulling off both British and American accents.  I also closed how he gave the sims a distinct accent of their own.  What can I say?  The audiobook was worth the wait.  \n\nLink to the original review on my blog: https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2019/04/book-review-different-flesh-by-harry.html?m=1",

So I have a lot of questions to ask.\n\nAlso I don't mind being spoiled by the books (haven't read them yet) even if from what I understood season 2 has mostly nothing in common with the books.\n\n1. Who are Rience and Lydia exactly ? I just know they want to find Ciri for someone.  \n2. What happened exactly with Lydia's face ? I mean what was she doing with the potion and why did it disfigured her ?  \n3. Who are their employer ? (apparently it could be >!Vilgefortz!< ?)\n\n  \n4. Who are Codringer and Fenn ? Why are they so important ?  \n5. Why Istredd went to warn the elves about Ciri ?\n\n  \n6. What is Tissaia's goal (and by extension Vilgefortz) ? I thought she did all of this to be in Vilgefortz bed  \n7. Why Yen didn't killed Cahir and escaped with him ?  \n8. Why did Triss returned to Aretuza ? Why did she feel betrayed by Tissaia ?\n\n  \n9. Why Fringilla killed every generals but kept Cahir alive ? I thought she did this before fleeing to Aretuza after her discussion with her uncle.  \n10. She stayed with Cahir at the end, so what was the point with her discussion with Artorius ?\n\n11. What was the goal of Voleith Meir ? Opening a gate through Ciri to return to her plan and reunite with the Wild Hunt ?  \n12. How was she attracted in Yen's body ?  \n13. Who was the little girl to Yen during the hut scene ? She's Emhyr and Ithlinne for the other ones but for Yen I don't know\n\n14. What is the goal of Dijkstra and Philippa ?  \n15. How old is Jaskier ? He met with Geralt a long time ago but he doesn't seem to age.  \n\n\nI think that's all, sorry for all of this questions !",

Thanks to the being, Ihuarraquax is once more among us. But the being has the Power. Should it wish to make use of it…\n- It will not be able to use it. Never. It relinquished it. It relinquished the Power. Utterly. The Power disappeared. It is most curious…\n- We will never understand these beings.\n- We do not need to understand them! We will remove existence from the being.

Even considering the fact that she did almost kill him, his hatred and constant shit-talking of Yen was a bit much (let’s be real, I’m sure plenty of ppl have tried to attack and maybe even kill Jaskier in his life- this is the whole reason he wants Geralt to go with him to Cintra initially as backup iirc). so I never really bought that rationale for his obvious hatred towards Yen. I mean even after she saved his life at great risk to herself this season it seemed like acknowledging that she may not have been as bad as he’d thought was like pulling teeth. It just doesn’t make sense unless he has some deeper reason for it-like jealousy.\n\nAnd this season it became even more obvious- he was basically behaving like a scorned lover, or an ex who was dumped, not like a guy who was pissed at his friend. Like this dude was writing legit Taylor-swift level songs bc he was bitter Geralt yelled at him and told him to leave him alone. It’s been months if not more- most ppl would be over it at this point, not stewing and trash talking like they’re healing from a broken heart. All I could think was that it was soo pathetic. And then all Geralt needs to do is essentially show up, and he jumps at the chance to forgive him (even though Geralt barely apologizes, and even then only after Jaskier makes it painfully obvious that he’s expecting one)…like a puppy in love desperate to get back with their ex.\n\nSo, point being, I wouldn’t be surprised if the show at some point in the future revealed that Jackie’s had feelings for Geralt (I guess making him bisexual if we have to label it). Given the way their relationship has been written so far, I’d actually prefer that as it would provide a legit explanation for Jaskier’s borderline obsessive behaviour.",

Now I know, this seems a dumb theory, but I had also considered A. he never slept with Lydia, we know this from \"Blood of Elves\", thanks (IIRC) to Tissaia's POV...even if Lydia was in love with him; B. we know that sorceress he had a relationship with was interested to him for his \"characteristics\", but mutilation would be another reason (aside from his magical potential) to motivate that sorceress' interest *and* his angry reaction to her interest; C. it would give Vilgefortz yet another reason for his misogyny: after all, he is supposed to hate *all* mages, because he can't know who of his parents was a mage (mother, father or both of them), so the hate towards women makes slightly less sense (even the abandonment, for example, could have been a decision of the father).\n\nSo I had theorized this hypothetical mutilation had created a rage in him and that rage had been redirected to women, combining an almost oedipal complex in a need for...\n\nDamn it! Let's make it simple and short: I had guessed book-Vilgefortz used the staff (and the godhood's goal) as compensation for a war-induced \"erectile dysfunction\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the way his show's relationship with Tissaia has been handled (clearly involving sex) means that theory is, at least pertaining to the show, debunked.",

Neither truly resonated with me and while I found some enjoyment in both to a degree, I eventually called it quits as I just couldn't maintain my interest with a multitude of other great series more suited to my specific tastes.\n\nBut after watching season 1 of the Wheel of Time and both seasons of the Witcher, my god, do I feel like I appreciate the books more.\n\nI'm a big advocate of adapting fiction to fit the medium and I think some of the best book to film/TV adaptations have taken a heavy hand in changing the story to fit the visual format. Lord of the Rings is a great example in Peter Jackson making changes that I felt didn't change the nature of the story or characters, but altering it just enough to make it work for film.\n\nBut both the Wheel of Time and to a lesser extent, the Witcher made SO many changes that were both unnecessary and also fundamentally changed the nature of the story, the characters and the world.\n\nAnd that would be fine to me, honestly, as someone who didn't even particularly LIKE the books they were adapting. But after experiencing those changes and comparing with the books, I actually came away liking the books MORE than I did previously because the changes just highlighted how much more interesting their take was than the TV versions.\n\nIt's not like these changes felt like they \"suited the medium\" more either. There were so many sequences in the Eye of the World that I felt would have been more cinematic than what we got (eg. the prologue, most of the major battles).\n\nChanges like Perrin having a wife and then immediately losing his wife, just to add drama, the episode entirely focussed on a Warder that was never in the books, the \"Who is the Dragon?\" intrigue, etc ... all of these additions to the story not only didn't ADD to the story in any meaningful way but actually meaningfully detracted from what was interesting about the books.\n\nIn particular, the \"Who is the Dragon\" drama was such an odd decision that felt like a marketing move because a focus group determined that \"People love intrigue and guessing games in TV!\" when in reality there was already a more compelling and unique mystery in the books. The question the show asked was \"Who is the Dragon?\" but the question the books asked was \"Is the Dragon a saviour or the harbinger of the apocalypse\"? Which I feel is already a more interesting inversion of the chosen one trope.\n\nAll in all, I think the overarching issue of this weird rant is that all of the changes felt like they reeked of arrogance: That the writers of the show felt like they could do a better job at telling the story than the books that they're adapting.\n\nI think this is the big difference in how fans will react to a work of adaptation. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings felt like Jackson revered the original texts and worked hard to adapt the core of what made them special. While the Wheel of Time and the Witcher felt like the showrunners felt like the original texts were flawed works that they could improve with their genius.\n\nUltimately, as someone who actually wanted to watch both shows BECAUSE I felt like the original texts were flawed works that could be improved, I ironically came away with a greater appreciation for the originals because of how fundamentally broken their adaptations were.\n\n**To even this out a bit, I do think that there are plenty of merits to both of these adapted works. I think the casting for the most part has been superb and there are sequences across both that are breath taking (eg. the final battle of the Witcher episode 1). The performances of the leads in particular across both shows are excellent and there are certain changes made that I do think actually IMPROVED upon the original text in some ways eg. the increased role of Logain in season 1.** \n\n **I'm not saying that either of these shows are completely without merit and if you liked these shows, then your opinion is perfectly valid.**",

Jaskier, Ciri, Geralt, and Yennefer were fighting the Cintran guards with Yarpen Zigrin at the end of episode 7.  Yennefer and Geralt get teleported away to the Endless Mother's hut, while Ciri rides away with Jaskier and the dwarves to Kaer Morhen.\n\nLater we find that Yennefer has to wake up Jaskier from a drunken sleep, which implies Ciri and Jaskier have been there for at least a night.  Geralt and Yennefer need to acquire horses and ride separately to Kaer Morhen.  Why does Ciri wait to start killing witchers until Yennefer and Geralt arrive?  Or the other question would be why does Jaskier immediately get drunk and go to sleep as soon as they arrive?",

It takes place between episodes 3 and 4 and tells the story of how Yennefer and Cahir get from the location of the failed execution to Gors Velen. Eight days of mostly bickering and bitching, and some surprisingly nice moments. Enemies to allies to friends (not lovers, but there are definitely some vibes) from Yennefer's point of view, strictly Witcher Netflix compliant. A few minor book spoilers. And plenty of Easter eggs for The Amazing Devil fans.\n\n(It's almost finished, only one more chapter to go, so you won't be left hanging right in the middle of things. I hate it when that happens to fanfics I enjoy although the authors certainly have understandable reasons why they don't continue their stories.)\n\n[https://archiveofourown.org/works/36103483/chapters/90000787](https://archiveofourown.org/works/36103483/chapters/90000787)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 1 - Stuck (with each other) excerpt**\n\n\"Why did they not come after us? Not the mages, nor the guards, bloody *nobody!*\"\n\n\"They are probably convinced that we won't get far no matter what we do. We are on a goddam *island!*\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I read maps before I lead an army into enemy territory.\"\n\n\"Of course, you do.\" Yennefer huffs. \"Those maps give you any useful ideas on how we can get away from here?\"\n\nCahir shrugs. \"Why don't you portal us out?\"\n\n\"Don't you think I'd have done so by now if it was that easy? Or do you actually believe I'm enjoying trudging through the wilderness and rain in the middle of the night? With a bloody Nilfgaardian!\" Yennefer bristles, then explains in a somewhat calmer tone of voice. \"Any portaling activity in and out of Thanedd is closely monitored. The Brotherhood's probably just waiting for me to try.\"\n\n\"If you didn't have a sound escape plan, or any plan at all, why save me? Why not just do what you were told and execute me? You killed thousands of our men with your fire, one more would hardly have made a difference.\"\n\n\"I *never* do what I am told. It's against my code of honour. But that is probably beyond a simple soldier to understand. As they don't do anything but follow orders.\"\n\n\"I am not a *simple soldier.*\"\n\n\"Right. Simple soldiers actually fight and die instead of watching the battle from *afar*.\" Yennefer has, of course, seen Cahir cross blades with Vilgefortz, and win, so she knows the insinuation is not really fair. However, her mood being particularly foul after what feels like hours in the cold in nothing but her rain-drenched dress, she has to lash out at something, someone.\n\n\"Count yourself lucky you did not end up with a simple soldier,\" Cahir spits. \"A simple soldier wouldn't know the first thing about how to trick the enemy.\"\n\n\"And *you* do? Then why again are we aimlessly stumbling through mud and brambles in the dark in the *fucking wrong direction?*\"\n\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .\n\n**Chapter 11**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u081bsfhgll81.jpg?width=1667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ee965d464139b03a857ffbc6fbf7d9a6e8e0f1\n\n[\\(Excerpt from Yennefer's nightmare\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rr0d0maggll81.jpg?width=1667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06457aa43ba2cc44454a45b286b0ffe84af2ae70)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7l7xageegll81.jpg?width=1666&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4c58eff745c0e0d543acbe88b82b6d405e08ec6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfdni2cdgll81.jpg?width=2108&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=334d5be3d51a40180acef0889e0d90e402d0580b\n\nIf you like alternative folk, you can buy The Amazing Devil albums here: [https://bandcamp.com/search?item\\_type&q=the%2Bamazing%2Bdevil](https://bandcamp.com/search?item_type&q=the%2Bamazing%2Bdevil)\n\n(or listen to their songs for free on spotify or youtube, I believe)",

        "title": "First Bingo + Book Reviews",
        "body": "[LINK TO BINGO CARD](https://i.imgur.com/aDfCifq.png)\n\nThis was my first time doing the bingo, and I had a really fun time with it! There were a number of books I might not have considered if not for this, and I liked most of them. I tried to get Hard Mode when possible, and though I didn’t quite make it for every square, I feel like I’ll probably be able to next time if I plan things from the start.\n\nTop Books: Piranesi, Empire of the Vampire, and the Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\n\nMost Surprising: the Bear and the Nightingale\n\nMost Disappointing: This is How You Lose the Time War\n\n**the Last Wish** by Andrzej Sapkowski (Five Short Stories) - 3.5/5\n\n>I gave this a try after watching and liking the first two seasons of the Witcher show. Though I still thoroughly enjoyed the setting, the themes, and Geralt’s signature personality and dry sense of humor, I’m not sure that I enjoyed the rest of it enough to keep reading the series. I liked Yennefer and Jaskier/Dandelion’s characters less, and in general things felt rather clunky and rough around the edges. It’s possible some of this is just due to the English translation, so I won’t rule out giving the second book a try down the line.\n\n**Spin the Dawn** by Elizabeth Lim (Set in Asia) - 3/5\n\n>The initial premise of ‘Mulan, but instead it’s a competition to become the Emperor’s personal tailor,’ was interesting and executed really well. I liked how the magical elements crept into the book over time, and the main character was engaging. However, about halfway through the book the plot shifts to a completely new direction, which felt much more like generic YA fantasy. The romance subplot also felt like took over the plot at this point, and sidelined the motivations of the main character.\n\n**Trail of Lightning** by Rebecca Roanhorse (A to Z Genre Guide) - 3.5/5\n\n>There were a lot of really cool moments in this book, and I loved the mashup of Native American gods and monsters with a post-apocalyptic United States. The main issues with the book were how often it didn’t capitalize on some of the best parts of the story, and in general how quickly the characters jumped from situation to situation. I still thoroughly enjoyed it, and the second book (Storm of Locusts) was a major step up from Roanhorse. I’m excited to read the third one whenever it comes out!\n\n**the House in the Cerulean Sea** by TJ Klune (Found Family) - 5/5\n\n>The House on the Cerulean Sea made me smile through tears more than maybe any other book I’ve read recently.  By the end of it, I just wanted to give every character a hug, and I dreaded the fact that I could never read the book again for the first time. The story and prose weren’t anything complicated, but the way I found myself discovering the world and the children of the orphanage alongside Linus consistently felt like being curled up in a warm blanket by the fire, even when I found myself getting sniffly.\n\n**the Song of Achilles** by Madeline Miller (1st Person POV) - 4.5/5\n\n>This was another tear jerker book. I found myself constantly rooting for Achilles and Patroclus and wanting them to be happy together, even though I went into the book knowing full well what would happen to them. Miller takes a few liberties in the details of various characters, but it felt worth it in general, especially for some of the minor characters (such as Achilles’ mother) who we know less about from the actual myth. One complaint I have is that the latter half of the book (the part during the Trojan war) dragged at times, though the ending made up for it.\n\n**the Jasmine Throne** by Tasha Suri (r/Fantasy Book Club) - 4.5/5\n\n>I’d never read any fantasy based on India/Southern Asia before, and this certainly left me wanting more in that category. The story is rather slow moving for the first 2/3’s of the book, but I liked almost all of the POV characters and found myself engaged in their hopes and struggles. I was a little disappointed by how minor the sapphic romance between two of the main characters ended up being (since that was how I’d heard about the book), and most of the regions of the world felt a little simplistic, but these were both minor issues that could easily vanish in the second book.\n\n**a Thousand Ships** by Natalie Haynes (New to You Author) - 4.5/5\n\n>As the other Greek Mythology-inspired book I read in the past year, this was very different from the Song of Achilles. At first I was very confused by the amount of POV switching and all the various names. There were still some characters I never really got attached to, but the more I read, the more I started enjoying most of them. Seeing the Trojan War and its aftermath from the standpoint of the women involved was a fresh and engaging spin on the mythos. One fun standout was Penelope’s increasingly passive-aggressive letters to Odysseus.\n\n**Harrow the Ninth** by Tamsyn Muir (Gothic Fantasy) - 4.5/5\n\n>I liked but didn’t love Gideon the Ninth. The characters and sense of mystery were excellent, but I found myself confused by a lot of the parts having to do with the details of necromancy. Harrow the Ninth on the other hand, while being at least twice as confusing for most of the book, was an incredible ride that I enjoyed nearly every second of. I went in having decided to just roll with whatever happened and hope for things to eventually make sense, and I felt completely rewarded for this mindset. Harrow’s POV made for a wildly entertaining and insane way to experience the story, and I fully intend to reread it before the release of Nona the Ninth this fall.\n\n**the Sandman** by Neil Gaiman (Backlist Book) - 4.5/5\n\n>A few of the specific arcs didn’t hit for me, but overall I loved the Sandman. Neil Gaiman excels at taking abstract deities and concepts and turning them into people with vivid personalities, and he knocked it out of the park with the depictions of Dream, the other Endless, and countless beings. My favorite story was the one with Lucifer and the key to Hell, and my least favorite was the one about the Elemental Girl. The final volumes in particular hit very hard emotionally in the best way.\n\n**the Shadow of the Gods** by John Gwynne (Revenge-Seeking Character) - 4.5/5\n\n>Do you like epic adventures? An engaging multi-POV cast? A Norse-inspired world? Then this is is the book for you. It took me some time at the beginning to settle into the world and characters due to the slow start, but once I did, this book picked me up and didn’t let me down until I was left reeling at the final pages. I’d recommend reading it physically (unlike me) due to the glossary at the end defining all the non-English words.\n\n**the Bone Houses** by Emily Lloyd-Jones (Mystery Plot) - 3.5/5\n\n>While nothing special, this was a short and enjoyable YA fantasy book that was never difficult to get through. The plucky main character Ryn, who works as a gravedigger, was snarky without being annoying. Her journey with a mapmaker named Ellis to unravel the mystery of the Bone Houses (risen skeletons that are only animated at night) tipped back and forth between horror and a fairy tale, before ultimately leaning more towards the latter. I don’t have any specific complaints, just that I was left wanting a bit more from the story and the twist at the end.\n\n**the Invisible Life of Addie LaRue** by V.E. Schwab (Comfort Read) - 5/5\n\n>I fell completely in love with this book. Before reading, I’d heard both positive and critical things about the book, and so I went in slightly wary, especially since I don’t usually like a plot with a more romantic focus. For me though, this book lived up the hype. I felt deeply emotionally invested in Addie’s journey through the centuries and her struggles in the present day. Some parts of the prose felt downright poetic, and I loved reading about Henry and Luc nearly as much as Addie herself. This is a book I see myself rereading multiple times over the years.\n\n**Empire of the Vampire** by Jay Kristoff (Published in 2021) - 5/5\n\n>I’m a sucker for gothic horror, hopeless fights against dark forces, and traditional (monstrous) vampires, so this book checked all the boxes for me. I liked structure of the book where it went back and forth between Gabriel’s early training years, his jaded middle-year self, and finally his older self narrating the story as he awaits execution. There was never a part of the story where I wasn’t excited to keep reading, and the world felt just similar enough to our own to draw some interesting parallels while still having its own distinct flair.\n\n**Priory of the Orange Tree** by Samantha Shannon (Cat Squasher) - 3.5/5\n\n>I liked this book, especially the main characters (Ead, Loth, Tanè) and the romance between two certain characters. The world that Samantha Shannon built up was incredible, and the slow burn story of the first 2/3’s of the book was excellent. That being said, the last 200 pages or so ended up feeling very rushed, and this book probably would’ve been better off as a duology or even a trilogy. Certain plot points also relied too much on characters happening to be in the right place at the right time.\n\n**Non-Fiction** by James Gleick (SFF Non-Fiction) - 2/5\n\n>Time travel is a concept that I typically enjoy in both books and movies, so this seemed like a book I would really enjoy. Unfortunately I found it dry and difficult to wade through. The concepts were interesting, but often wrapped in layers and layers of tedious examples and long explanations that had me forcing myself not to skim through. I wouldn’t have finished this book at all if I hadn’t switched to listening to the audiobook.\n\n**Mexican Gothic** by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (Latin American Author) - 4/5\n\n>Horror/Thriller isn’t a genre I usually engage with much, but I liked this story enough that I’m interested in trying more of the same down the line. I was a little disappointed by how some of the reveals were handled at the end, but overall Moreno-Garcia does a great job of weaving a mystery and making the reader feel like something uncomfortable is happening at the same time as the main character is discovering it.\n\n**Legends and Lattes** by Travis Baldree (Self-Published) - 3.5/5\n\n>This was a cute little slice of life book about a former D&D adventurer Orc leaving behind fighting and opening up her own coffee shop instead. It was a bit light on plot and character development, but was a lot of fun to read and didn’t overstay its welcome. Recommended to anyone looking for something cozy in a fantasy world.\n\n**the Bear and the Nightingale** by Katherine Arden (Forest Setting) - 5/5\n\n>Though it wasn’t my absolute favorite, this might have been the best written book I read in the past year. Arden did a masterful job of blending Slavic folklore with the setting of Medieval Muscovy/Russia. Every character felt fleshed out and interesting, and the imagery did a beautiful job of helping me picture what was happening from scene to scene. The other two books in this trilogy are just as phenomenal.\n\n**This is How Your Lose the Time War** (Genre Mashup) - 2.5/5\n\n>A story about agents on opposing side of a ‘war in time’ falling in love through secret letters to one another sounded like a great premise. I did indeed like the poetic way that many of their letters to one another were written, but otherwise the execution of such a cool premise was a chaotic mess. I never felt like I was given enough info on what Red and Blue were doing, what their organizations were, or why any of it really mattered. Their personalities also felt nearly identical, and for any given chapter I had to check the beginning to know which character it was about.\n\n**Piranesi** by Susanna Clarke (Chapter Titles) - 5/5\n\n>I went into this book completely blind, and I’m very glad I did. It’s difficult for me to talk about any specifics due to how much of the plot is built on the reader discovering the world alongside the main character. Reading this book filled me with a sense of childlike wonder and awe, and I recommend it to any fan of speculative fiction, especially given how quick of a read it is.\n\n**House of Earth and Blood** by Sarah J. Maas (_ of _ and _) - 3/5\n\n>Despite the overwhelming mishmash of awkward worldbuilding, the poor editing, the often meandering plot, and the constant sexual descriptions of characters, there were still things to like about this book. I loved the side characters and politics of the Crescent City, and the final 150 pages were action-packed and full of exciting twists and turns. As usual, my relationship with a SJM book is very love/hate, though leaning towards hate this time.\n\n**Arrival** by Ted Chiang (First Contact) - 3/5\n\n>This short story collection was a mixed bag for me. I really enjoyed the “Tower of Babylon,” “Hell in the Absence of God,” and “Liking what you see,” but the rest fell short. The ones I dislike focused more on the convoluted scientific concepts they were exploring and had rather flat characters, whereas the ones I had an easier time with felt more grounded in human issues.\n\n**The City We Became** by N.K. Jemisin (Trans or Nonbinary) - 3/5\n\n>I loved Jemisin’s other works (the Inheritance Trilogy, the Broken Earth Trilogy), but this felt like a step down. Everything after the spectacular prologue felt rushed, with problems being solved by convenient happenstance and constant heavy-handed metaphors about gentrification. The main characters ranged from somewhat relatable/interesting to stereotype caricatures. The Staten Island girl in particular seemed to change personality and motivation several times just based on the needs of the plot. A lot of the book was still enjoyable despite these major downsides.\n\n**City of Brass** by S.A. Chakraborty (Debut Author) - 4.5/5\n\n>This was a great historical fantasy book that, along with its two sequels, had a good blend of adventure and political drama amidst a backdrop of the Muslim world of the early 1800’s (except also with Djinn). I loved all three of the main POV characters, and there was the perfect amount of romantic subplot without it being too much. The racial tension between the pureblooded Djinn and Shafit (part-humans) was very well done along with all the related themes.\n\n**a Wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking** by T. Kingfisher (Witches) - 4/5\n\n>A fun and lighthearted romp involving a baker/wizard who has only has the power to animate things made out of dough. The obstacles and villains in the plot were a little simplistic and easy to overcome at times, but the book made up for it with all the creative applications of the main character’s magic, and her friendships with other magical folks in a city where anything out of the ordinary is being treated with increasing suspicion.",

        "body": "[LINK TO BINGO CARD](https://i.imgur.com/aDfCifq.png)\n\nThis was my first time doing the bingo, and I had a really fun time with it! There were a number of books I might not have considered if not for this, and I liked most of them. I tried to get Hard Mode when possible, and though I didn’t quite make it for every square, I feel like I’ll probably be able to next time if I plan things from the start.\n\nTop Books: Piranesi, Empire of the Vampire, and the Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\n\nMost Surprising: the Bear and the Nightingale\n\nMost Disappointing: This is How You Lose the Time War\n\n**the Last Wish** by Andrzej Sapkowski (Five Short Stories) - 3.5/5\n\n>I gave this a try after watching and liking the first two seasons of the Witcher show. Though I still thoroughly enjoyed the setting, the themes, and Geralt’s signature personality and dry sense of humor, I’m not sure that I enjoyed the rest of it enough to keep reading the series. I liked Yennefer and Jaskier/Dandelion’s characters less, and in general things felt rather clunky and rough around the edges. It’s possible some of this is just due to the English translation, so I won’t rule out giving the second book a try down the line.\n\n**Spin the Dawn** by Elizabeth Lim (Set in Asia) - 3/5\n\n>The initial premise of ‘Mulan, but instead it’s a competition to become the Emperor’s personal tailor,’ was interesting and executed really well. I liked how the magical elements crept into the book over time, and the main character was engaging. However, about halfway through the book the plot shifts to a completely new direction, which felt much more like generic YA fantasy. The romance subplot also felt like took over the plot at this point, and sidelined the motivations of the main character.\n\n**Trail of Lightning** by Rebecca Roanhorse (A to Z Genre Guide) - 3.5/5\n\n>There were a lot of really cool moments in this book, and I loved the mashup of Native American gods and monsters with a post-apocalyptic United States. The main issues with the book were how often it didn’t capitalize on some of the best parts of the story, and in general how quickly the characters jumped from situation to situation. I still thoroughly enjoyed it, and the second book (Storm of Locusts) was a major step up from Roanhorse. I’m excited to read the third one whenever it comes out!\n\n**the House in the Cerulean Sea** by TJ Klune (Found Family) - 5/5\n\n>The House on the Cerulean Sea made me smile through tears more than maybe any other book I’ve read recently.  By the end of it, I just wanted to give every character a hug, and I dreaded the fact that I could never read the book again for the first time. The story and prose weren’t anything complicated, but the way I found myself discovering the world and the children of the orphanage alongside Linus consistently felt like being curled up in a warm blanket by the fire, even when I found myself getting sniffly.\n\n**the Song of Achilles** by Madeline Miller (1st Person POV) - 4.5/5\n\n>This was another tear jerker book. I found myself constantly rooting for Achilles and Patroclus and wanting them to be happy together, even though I went into the book knowing full well what would happen to them. Miller takes a few liberties in the details of various characters, but it felt worth it in general, especially for some of the minor characters (such as Achilles’ mother) who we know less about from the actual myth. One complaint I have is that the latter half of the book (the part during the Trojan war) dragged at times, though the ending made up for it.\n\n**the Jasmine Throne** by Tasha Suri (r/Fantasy Book Club) - 4.5/5\n\n>I’d never read any fantasy based on India/Southern Asia before, and this certainly left me wanting more in that category. The story is rather slow moving for the first 2/3’s of the book, but I liked almost all of the POV characters and found myself engaged in their hopes and struggles. I was a little disappointed by how minor the sapphic romance between two of the main characters ended up being (since that was how I’d heard about the book), and most of the regions of the world felt a little simplistic, but these were both minor issues that could easily vanish in the second book.\n\n**a Thousand Ships** by Natalie Haynes (New to You Author) - 4.5/5\n\n>As the other Greek Mythology-inspired book I read in the past year, this was very different from the Song of Achilles. At first I was very confused by the amount of POV switching and all the various names. There were still some characters I never really got attached to, but the more I read, the more I started enjoying most of them. Seeing the Trojan War and its aftermath from the standpoint of the women involved was a fresh and engaging spin on the mythos. One fun standout was Penelope’s increasingly passive-aggressive letters to Odysseus.\n\n**Harrow the Ninth** by Tamsyn Muir (Gothic Fantasy) - 4.5/5\n\n>I liked but didn’t love Gideon the Ninth. The characters and sense of mystery were excellent, but I found myself confused by a lot of the parts having to do with the details of necromancy. Harrow the Ninth on the other hand, while being at least twice as confusing for most of the book, was an incredible ride that I enjoyed nearly every second of.

Harrow’s POV made for a wildly entertaining and insane way to experience the story, and I fully intend to reread it before the release of Nona the Ninth this fall.\n\n**the Sandman** by Neil Gaiman (Backlist Book) - 4.5/5\n\n>A few of the specific arcs didn’t hit for me, but overall I loved the Sandman.

        "title": "Review: Lost Worlds and Mythological Kingdoms (new stories by Becky Chambers, Seanan McGuire, and others)",
        "body": "“Lost Worlds and Mythological Kingdoms” is an anthology of exactly that- 17 all-new stories about discovering or re-discovering forgotten lands and mythological places. These stories are varied and almost all of particularly high quality, with many interesting and unique takes on the trope. Highly recommend if you’re a fan of these types of stories!\n\nINDIVIDUAL REVIEWS FOR EACH STORY:\n\nThe Light Long Lost at Sea (4/5)\n\nThe first story in this is already an interesting one. On first sight, it appears people have discovered a remnant of the old empire- underwater ruins in a post-magic society. But forgotten things are often infused with old magic...\n\nThe Cleft of Bones (3.5/5)\n\nA community of slaves has to hide for a tsunami, discovering a forgotten place while doing so. A well-told story, in a developed-feeling world. Another story that doesn't entirely feel like a classic adventure story discovering lost worlds.\n\nThe Voyage of Brenya (4.5/5)\n\nHere's the \"mythological\"' part! A women desperate to save her people from raiders decides to travel to the West by boat, to the land of the gods.\n\nComfort Lodge, Enigma Valley (3.5/5)\n\nA very fun Calvino-esque story of some magical lodge told in the way of customer reviews.\n\nThe Expedition Stops for the Evening at the Foot of the Mountain Pass (2.5/5)\n\nThis one never felt like it went anywhere. An intermezzo, a break during an expedition, with a bit too much left unsaid for me.\n\nDown in the Dim Kingdoms (4/5)\n\nA conquistador discovered a city in the center of the earth. Now, decades later, he visits with his family right before the place is about to become a tourist hotspot. His legacy is explored. Succinct! Reminded me of Silverberg's Downward to the Earth.\n\nThose Who Have Gone (4/5)\n\nA slower story, slowly winning me over by the end. Triss and her asshole boyfriend are traveling through a national park in the United States, a place so big it might as well be a country of its own. Much of it is still unexplored-- who knows, there might even be people living there? Feels like a parable.\n\nAn Account, by Dr. Ingle Kühn, of the Summer Expedition and Its Discoveries (3/5)\n\nOn a dying Earth, scientists in Antarctica discover an underground city. Another slower story, written like a diary.\n\nOut of the Dark (4/5)\n\nAn anthropological story of two people landing on a planet where the colonists of old have reverted to a more primitive way of living (think Planet of Exile). The two scientists now face a conundrum: do they report this place as no longer having \"civilized\" (described as sapient in the story, but it amounts to the same thing) life, which would lead to the destruction of these people, or do they let them be?\n\nEndosymbiosis (3/5)\n\nMore of a horror story, discovering Lovecraftian creatures.\n\nThe Orpheus Gate (2/5)\n\nA story about ghosts and spirits. Not my cup of tea, never has been. Well-written though, and I'm sure it's a nice story if it's your type of thing.\n\nHotel Motel Holiday Inn (1/5)\n\nAnother disappointing story... Contemporary tale of a hotel, not much interesting happened in it.\n\nOn the Cold Hill Side (4.5)\n\nFantastic! According to local legend, the island of Harbor's Hope keeps disappearing and re-appearing every hundred years or so. This story explores what happens when legends become real, and islands appear out of thin air.\n\nThe Return of Grace Malfrey (3.5)\n\nA similar story, but instead of an island it's a girl. Grave disappeared one day, from one moment to the next. Now, ten years later, she falls out of the sky on a parking lot. What happened in those ten years? Where has she been?\n\nThe Tomb Ship (4.5)\n\nWhen Laym discovers an ancient spaceship of legend, she can't believe her eyes. History will have to be re-contexualised, and choices will have to be made... The only story in this that's actually set in space, and it's a great one!\n\nPellargonia: A Letter to the Journal of Imaginary Anthropology (4/5)\n\nA group of friends imagine a country and it becomes real. This epistolary story explores the consequences of this event.\n\nThere, She Didn't Need Air to Fill Her Lungs (3/5)\n\nMagic and hills! A fun story, but nothing particularly special.\n\nDisclaimer: I received an ARC of this in exchange for an honest review.",

        "body": " Been on a binge of romance/Fantasy manga and want to pick up some novels to read too. I found that a lot of romance novels are aimed towards women, and I usually don't find myself enjoying the relationships.  \n\nWant something less YA and more adulty (doesn't mean explicitly written sex but just more maturity). I wouldn't mind an intense novel, but I recently just finished Faithless by Graham Austin-King so I'm looking for something less intense atm. If the romance is really good though, I'll add it to my list to read later. \n\n**Examples of Good Romances From Novels (IMO):** \n\n* **Percy & Annabeth (Percy Jackson):** Been a couple of years since I last read PJatO but their relationship was an excellent part of the series. It was believable, had no damsel in distress bullshit and both of them had great chemistry together. \n* **Adolin & Shallan (Stormlight):** Not a big part of the series by any means, but I like how they both come to each other's aid. They also have good chemistry. \n* **Geralt and Yen (The Witcher):** Decent romance, excellent chemistry, although I think Geralt and Ciri was a significantly better platonic relationship than Geralt and Yen. \n* **Trissney and** >!Gabriel!< **(The Gods are Bastards):** Relationships are pretty hit or miss for this series, and while this is technically unconfirmed, it's pretty likely gonna happen. They have good chemistry and it's interesting to see how they pull each other in better directions when they start as pretty big POSs. \n\nPretty much all I got for mostly fantasy-related books or shows. Honestly, most of my favorite series to watch or read either have little to no romance.\n\n**Examples of Terrible Romances from Novels (IMO):**\n\n* **Literally anything from WoT:** WoT fans can justify this storywise however they want, but almost every romance in this series (I am taking a break on book 8) is absolute dogshit. Rand and Min is alright, but the rest is just absolute shit, almost all of them lacking chemistry and all of them hella unbelievable. Nyanaeve and Lan have to be the worst, there isn't even a good plot convenience for that one. You can tell I have strong feelings about the romance lol. \n* **All of them from Six of Crows**: Cool world, interesting enough characters, but I hated the romance so I never finished the book. Too YA For me, some of the inner character dialogue made me die a bit inside. \n* **Anything from Harry Potter**: Not really romances I guess, because its a small part of the story and very underdeveloped. \n* **50% of Shounen Fantasy/Action Anime/Manga.** Mostly damsel in distress or generally hella underdeveloped. \n\nThere are a lot of YA novels that I could list here, but I forgot their name lol. \n\n**Mediocre Romances from stuff I like**\n\n* Daredevil, ATLA, Eragon (surprisingly it wasn't terrible), Kane Chronicles, Magi, Ranger's Apprentice, 50% of Shounen manga/anime.  \n\nTY for the help.",

        "body": "# [Review on Youtube](https://youtu.be/yp8dU69aXyY)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s1u30ce8jjn81.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efcde49b6cc9f73637dc2b1f44d16737da18114\n\n# [The Fires of Heaven](https://youtu.be/yp8dU69aXyYhttps://www.amazon.com/Fires-Heaven-Book-Five-Wheel-ebook/dp/B0037V18D2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=SM4VLFEULK2C&keywords=the+fires+of+heaven+robert+jordan&qid=1647347955&sprefix=%2Caps%2C282&sr=8-1)\n\nPicking up from the escalating amount of conflict that helped to move the story and the main characters forth in The Shadow Rising, The Fires of Heaven starts with the same overall pacing; it is no longer a slow starter like the first three books, and it progressively speeds up with the convergence of the various plotlines and character arcs to their inevitable conclusion. Contrary to the earlier volumes of The Wheel of Time, there is a stable balance of the quantity of build-up and their respective resolutions in a fashion that does not meander or harm the pacing. Whilst reading The Fires of Heaven, I never felt as if some plotlines were walking in circles to reach the final destination. Instead, the several story arcs are succinct, while retaining the richness of detail, nuance, and interesting character interactions that this story is known for.\n\nWhen it comes to characterization and story arcs, Moiraine and Nynaeve receive a tremendous amount of development, be it in their psyche or how such changes inherently shift how they interact with problems. I was never really compelled by Moiraine's character, and that may be attributed to how few points of view she received throughout the story, which can easily weaken how much attachment the reader can feel toward a character. Well, suffice to say that the crossing of the Spine of the World did wonders to her character’s likeability; her desperation and willingness to do what must be done is better conveyed through her actions and thoughts. Her anger and coldness receive another layer of depth, and the emotional conflict she has had with Rand—since the first volume—finally gets the long hinted conclusion. The closing scene to her story arc is well-executed, emotional, and, perhaps most importantly, nuanced enough to evoke nothing but bittersweet delight toward it.\n\nThe dynamic between Nynaeve and Egwene puts into light a new side of the former Wisdom of the Two Rivers; amidst all the self-assurance, authority, and control, there is a flawed and fragile human being. This certainly serves as a great tool to keep her story arc interesting, even when, most of the time, the situations dealt by Elayne and Nynaeve pale in scale to what has the Dragon Reborn on edge. Of course, there is not to say their story arc is without a good amount of tension and conflict, but the focus leans on the various traumas and psychological blocks the two women accrued along their perilous journey. Like a highwalker, their storyline balances on the rope of ever-looming tension, produced by the agents of the shadow, and lighthearted interactions that provide a needed break from the other decidedly darker story arcs the rest of the Two Rivers folk are dealing with.\n\nHaving their future prospects never be as uncertain as now, Min, Siuan, Leane, and others depart on a journey to find new hopes in order to continue their preparation for the Final Battle, which is undoubtedly ever-closer. The tone of their arc is executed similarly to Elayne and Nynaeve’s; a lot of attention is paid to displaying how their current deficiencies and the shift in the power dynamics of the continent affect their interaction with other characters and how much this change weights in their hearts and minds. After what transpired in the White Tower, in The Shadow Rising, reading about Siuan and Leane almost feels like meeting completely new characters. Their traumatic experiences fundamentally altered nearly everything about their lives and, to an extent, even their beliefs. The range of emotions displayed by the duo is a clear improvement from the previous books, and their struggle to find a new anchor to give meaning to their lives makes for a more profound and relatable characterization. Not to mention that there is space for a different kind of humor, one darker than what is done with Nynaeve’s entourage but just as enjoyable.\n\nAt this point, it is common knowledge that sparing the life of someone who feels nothing but hatred and contempt toward you is the same as asking for trouble, and Rand and Mat’s story arc does not stray from that line of thought. Usually, this realization walks hand in hand with severe changes in what the characters are willing to sacrifice to prevent it from happening again. Rand, as cold-blooded as he has become, still holds to a shred of humanity, although that sliver is forced to become progressively smaller due to how cruel and unforgiving the world is and how high a price duty requires. In The Fires of Heaven, his overprotectiveness and unrealistic view toward women—one of the few comforts he still carries from his place of birth—receive an inevitable development. With such a culturally ingrained view on the matter, it is somewhat risky to bring a complete and irreversible change in behavior, but the conclusion of his emotional arc is subtle, delicate, and ultimately heralds an important turning point in his war against the Forsaken. To me, this is the highlight of his arc, and I hope the events responsible for forcing this change do not lose their impact in the books to come.\n\nEver since the acquisition of the shadow-tainted dagger, in Shadar Logoth, Mat has been always cautious when dealing with Aes Sedai and other mysterious entities that may be connected to the One Power. He has tried to run away from a duty that was seemingly forced into his hands, but responsibility always held his character from abandoning the people of his childhood. This psychological struggle receives additional development, in The Fires of Heaven, as the ongoing events slowly but surely bring to light the inevitability of fate and the futility of fighting against it. Contrary to Rand's comparable understanding and thorough acceptance of a Ta'veren’s duty, Mat's emotional conflict is only resolved to an initial extent, and I would have it no other way; as a famous trickster and gambler, his will to deny the bindings of the pattern is reasonably more tenacious than either Rand or Perrin's. The events that jumpstart his new resolution are implemented with a shocking plot twist, yet the clues sowed since the beginning of their journey across the Dragon Wall guarantee an organic outcome that does not feel forced only to move the plot along.\n\nWhen all the threads finally connect, they herald an engaging action-filled conclusion that ultimately tries to hide its predictable outcome behind high stakes. Rand’s desperation to engage in battle is credible, but the circumstances that validate such approach also condemn its outcome to predictability; it is one of those moments you dare the author to stick with such a drastic development, even though it is clear that continuing those events would irreversibly harm the subsequent story. That being said, being predictable does not make it immediately bad. The final fight is interesting, and the unexpected participation of an ally increased the tension and possible paths to end the battle. One thing that bothered me, however, was the complete lack of interactions or conversation between the two parties; for such a dangerous reunion of ancient foes, I feel that some conversation, taunts, or gloating translated to verbal attacks would not feel out of place. In fact, I would have enjoyed it more had that been so.\n\nThe Fires of Heaven was an amazing read, only second to The Shadow Rising. There is little to no unnecessary meandering, the pacing is faster, there is more action, and the character development is rich and deep. Although some moments could be improved, the quality of storytelling has yet again grown better, and all the story arcs of the main characters are compelling to read. I hope it keeps up with the quality, and I anticipate reading the following book.",

I was bothered how Siri is just okay with garelt being with triss when it would be like your parents divorcing and your father ending up with a woman that tried to take advantage of you in the past.\n\nThe Last Story decision that I really don't like is what they did with the white Frost. In the books the white Frost turns out to be natural climate change that nothing can stop. However in the game it's changed to be some sort of Super Evil entity so ciri is turned into the chosen one whose powers can save the world from the Big Bad Evil ice monster.",

I was bothered how Siri is just okay with garelt being with triss when it would be like your parents divorcing and your father ending up with a woman that tried to take advantage of you in the past.\n\nThe Last Story decision that I really don't like is what they did with the white Frost. In the books the white Frost turns out to be natural climate change that nothing can stop. However in the game it's changed to be some sort of Super Evil entity so ciri is turned into the chosen one whose powers can save the world from the Big Bad Evil ice monster.",

        "body": "So I finally started watching season 2, not without fear. So far I am enjoying it. There are good direction gimmicks and ideas. We see (slightly) more witcher potions, more signs. The sceneries and artistic conduction are beautiful. Musics too are a bit more influenced by the game, it seems to me.\n\nAlthough so far I am a bit concerned by two things:\n\n\\- The fact that the battle of Sodden Hill happened at the end of season 1. Let me explain.\n\nIn the books, the Fall of Cintra and the Battle of Sodden Hill take place in 1263. Geralt finds Ciri again in the short story \"Something More\" in 1264 after learning that Yen didn't die at Sodden Hill but Triss assumely did. Ciri starts training in Kaer Morhen in 1265. Events of Blood of Elves and espacially Time of Contempt happen in 1267. So Ciri has been training for 2 or 3 years it seems, before leaving Kaer Morhen, Yen has recovered from blindness and Geralt learned that Triss wasn't dead, so invited her to Kaer Morhen to learn more about Ciri's capacities.\n\nIn the serie, s02 takes place right after the Battle of Sodden Hill. It implies there is still a kind of fierce hatred of Nilfgaard among mages as casualties were numerous. I wonder how Thanedd coup will be brought to the plot and how they will write characters such as Tissaia remaining kind of neutral and Vilgefortz becoming the main antagonist and a Nilfgaard sympathizer just a few months after he was the hero of Sodden Hill.\n\n\\- The fact that Yen is stealing plot arcs :\n\nYen lost her power after using fire magic at Sodden Hill, just like Ciri does in Time of Contempt. While Y'ens blindness will be wiped away from the scenario, it implies she needs to get her powers back, teaming up with Cahir, being labelled as a traitor for the whole conclave of mages after she set him free. I wonder how she's doing to teach magic to Ciri in Melitele's temple.\n\nShe also steals the fact that she was supposed to be on the obelisk of Sodden Hill but was finally found alive, instead of Triss. But as Triss is known alive too, neither Triss' of Yen's name is on the obelisk at the end.\n\nI also wonder how Geralt will learn about Yen being alive, as he was told by Tissaia in S2E1 that she was dead. In the books, he finds out by not seeing her name on the obelisk.\n\nI am only at E3, so I guess plotlines will evolve again.I don't mind Eskel's death, he's not a major and unique character of all he political mess happening in southern realms. I don't mind the elves being transfered to Cintra instead of just implying they have an agreement with Nilfgaard to have some Scoia'tel attacking humans in Redania or Temeria, I don't mind Triss' or Fringilla's appearances. But I wonder how the big red plotline revolving around Ciri can still be on tracks if Yen can't teach her magic, if no one can say she's a Source, if there is no point in storyline to have a Thanedd coup and try to kidnap her.\n\nSo without spoiling the serie, how much are my worries well founded? Were you also concerned by these changes?",

        "body": "The first season was populated by many side characters that only appeared in one episode, yet their storylines were so memorable—if brief. Their interaction with the main characters are much more interesting than those in the second season, and their interactions with other side characters are interesting too! Renfri, Calanthe and Villentretenmerth felt so much more meaningful than Dijkstra, Nenneke or Rience.\n\nFilavandrel has like one scene in S1, yet his lines are way more meaningful than all of his presence in S2. It's so beautiful when Geralt convinces him to go away and rebuilt and not becoming the monster humans claim he is.\n\nCalanthe and Pavetta also only have one scene together, yet the tension between mother and daughter is so palpable!\n\nCahir and Yennefer have no chemistry what so ever. You could argue that Yennefer had more interesting dialogue with the moneylender in S1E5 or with Beau Berrant when he cuffs her in the same episode.\n\nJaskier was the hidden gems of S1, with is quick wit and funny moments. In S2 he's too somber and spent, a shadow of his former self.\n\nNot much tension between Geralt and Istredd either, even though they are fighting for the same woman. Their interaction is very flat.\n\nFringilla is probably the only side character who has improved from S1 to S2.\n\nI was thinking about how in S1 even smaller interactions with minor characters like Foltest and Renfri were so poignant, the words so sharp, and how you had to read between the lines. I liked rewatching some episodes because the dialogue was so so so good (S1E5 with Yennefer/Tissaia and later Yennefer/Geralt being a prime example). The only new characters introduced in S2 who have meaningful dialogues are Francesca and Vesemir.",

But Vilgefortz kills him pretty easily - how?!<\n\n>!It's implied that Ciri tells Galahad her whole story, and is weeping, as if Geralt and Yen are dead - but then they ride off into the sunset and she's laughing and thinking if bedding him? Why? This felt out of character, to me.!<\n\n>!why is Yen so weak & can't heal Geralt?!<\n\n>!Ciri says she could heal Geralt if she hadn't renounced her power - but if she didn't have it this whole time since the Tower of Gulls, how did she travel between worlds after the Tower of Swallows?!<\n\nPlease, NO spoilers!! If you can't answer a question because it's answered in the last book, just say so. \n\nThanks so much!! Loving these books. Baptism of Fire may still be my fave, but doesn't have enough Yen. I really enjoyed Tower of Swallows, too. Lady of the Lake had too many wide stories I didn't care much for, ie Jarre, etc.",

IIRC dying light 2 did this with one of the endings of the first game’s DLC being the true ending despite allowing you to choose another. I chose the other ending in that game and it makes me feel like my choice didn’t matter at all. The Witcher 3 thrived off of its player choice and I think it would suck if the next game decided that ciri definitely lived and took on a certain life path because it means that any choice you made in Witcher 3 that differed didn’t matter in the end.",

        "body": "   \n*“Why can’t you make it easier for me to hate you?”*  \n\n\n**So What’s It About?**  \n\n\nIn a famine-stricken village on a dusty yellow plain, two children are given two fates. A boy, greatness. A girl, nothingness…  \n\n\nIn 1345, China lies under harsh Mongol rule. For the starving peasants of the Central Plains, greatness is something found only in stories. When the Zhu family’s eighth-born son, Zhu Chongba, is given a fate of greatness, everyone is mystified as to how it will come to pass. The fate of nothingness received by the family’s clever and capable second daughter, on the other hand, is only as expected.  \n\n\nWhen a bandit attack orphans the two children, though, it is Zhu Chongba who succumbs to despair and dies. Desperate to escape her own fated death, the girl uses her brother's identity to enter a monastery as a young male novice. There, propelled by her burning desire to survive, Zhu learns she is capable of doing whatever it takes, no matter how callous, to stay hidden from her fate.  \n\n\nAfter her sanctuary is destroyed for supporting the rebellion against Mongol rule, Zhu takes the chance to claim another future altogether: her brother's abandoned greatness.  \n\n\n**What I Thought**  \n\n\nThis has been hyped up as THE new sweepingly epic historical fantasy of 2021, and, for me at least, it has absolutely delivered. It’s a book with strong themes and strong action, so you really get the best of both worlds.  \n\n\nSpeaking of those themes, I would say that the main four are identity (especially gender identity), desire, struggling with fate, and greatness vs. nothingness. I think that the former two are somewhat better developed than the latter two. As far as identity goes, there are several characters whose expressions of gender fall outside of prescribed boundaries, and Parker-Chan does a great job of exploring their experiences. We see Zhu, born a girl and living as a man, panic any time she identifies with a woman because she is convinced that the only way to have the fate of greatness that she desires is to be a man. She feels the gaze of heaven on her when she performs a womanly skill, which is a great way of showing how we self-monitor and regulate our performances of gender. Ultimately, she realizes that she only survived the shame of her hand being cut off because she was not her brother - her hiding and striving to conceal her identity (which she equates with weakness) belie the fact that it is that very identity that makes her as resilient as she is.  \n\n\nOuyang is another character who has a very complicated relationship with his identity as someone who has been castrated - he is full of deep loathing for himself as well as for women, and it’s such an interesting point that Esen does not understand why he hates being compared to women. His feelings for Esen is also very complicated because of the terrible shame he feels for his desire and submissiveness, to say nothing of the fact that Esen's family is responsible for his family's massacre.  \n\n\nAnother character with an especially interesting relationship with desire and gender identity is Ma, who is pushed by Zhu to want things for herself in spite of being raised as a woman who should not do that. She finds desire a painful burden because some of the things she wants are impossible and ends up suffering for her love of Zhu, caught up in brutal machinations that she abhors. (Ma’s desire also leads us to an utterly random fisting scene lol). Finally, there is Baoxiang, who refuses to be “manly” and is treated with contempt in spite of the fact that he keeps his father in power through his excellent administration. A side note is that Baoxiang is absolutely vicious and petty and kind of steals the show whenever he turns up.  \n\n\nI really liked the parallels between Zhu and Ouyang, who have complex love for empathetic, open-hearted people and identities outside of the gender norms of their world. They both engage in brutal betrayals for the sake of their fates and are essentially antiheroes making excuses for the terrible things they do while better people suffer for it.  \n\n\nI think the themes of struggling with fate/ its inevitability and greatness vs. nothingness didn’t feel quite as well fleshed out for me. There is just a lot of repetition of them on the page. I do think that you can absolutely make a connection between greatness, nothingness, masculinity, and femininity, however. Overall, this is simultaneously deeply thoughtful and very exciting. The action is gripping, the storytelling deft, and the twists pretty stunning. I am so looking forward to the next book!",

        "body": "I know that there are a lot of details that were changed between the books and the show, but for many of them, I can see the reasoning. It's a different medium, after all, and there will inevitably need to be modifications. The show actually seems to be developing each character in the story with care, and I personally believe that the majority of The Witcher's characters are at their best in the screen adaptation.\n\nTriss and Yennefer, as well as several minor roles-- including Istredd, Fringilla, Cahir, and Tissaia-- are all both presented with knowledge and respect for their original versions, while also being given room to develop on their own in ways that we never get to see in the books. I am especially enjoying how we get to follow Cahir and understand him in a way that we were never allowed when following Geralt and Ciri.\n\nAs for the two protagonists, I am happy with their depictions thus far. I have enjoyed seeing Ciri's development between seasons, and of course, Cavill does an excellent job as Geralt. I would say that Jaskier/Dandelion is the only character that I dislike more in the show than in the books and games. It's something about his acting that makes him feel a little two-dimensional for me; moreso even than in his other versions.\n\nIt's because of this concentration on fleshing out other characters beyond Ciri and Geralt's perspectives that I believe many of the changes to the story were implemented, and I'm fine with these decisions. I also agree with the choice to take the original stories-- which span around thirty to fourty years in the books-- and aggregate them into a shorter timeline. I don't mine Ciri visiting Nivellen's castle, and in fact that episode has been my favorite of all of them so far!\n\nI think my only complaint as of yet is, unfortunately, the writing. In particular, the writers seem to value drama and action over logical cause and effect, which has lead to strange character decisions, contrived plot events, coincidences, and unrealistic timelines which draw me out of my immersion more than I'd prefer.\n\nAll in all, though, I'm enjoying the show. I think it's cool. And I'm excited for what's to come!",

        "body": "For those who are unfamiliar with the techniques:\n\nHalf-Swording consists of using your off-hand to hold onto your own blade past the middle, and stab more accurately. Historically, it would have been used to poke at armor weaknesses, like the visor slit, neck and armpits.\n\nThe murderstroke is where you grab your own sword backwards, by holding the blade with both hands, and use the guard and the pommel as a hammer. Once again, this would be used against armor.\n\nI can't find an example of either techniques used in media. The closest would be the Witcher on Netflix, where Geralt sometimes grabs his own or his opponent's blade barehanded.\n\n[Left: Halfswording Right: Murderstroke](https://preview.redd.it/huf1sveu00z81.jpg?width=860&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fe943f9a710f5d899e666661a5120500864abc5)",

        "title": "Dauntless (The Lost Fleet #1) by Jack Campbell - One of my favorite sci-fi space fleet series 4.5/5",
        "body": "https://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1720-dauntless\n\n4.5/5\n\nDAUNTLESS (The Lost Fleet #1) by Jack Campbell has the premise of Captain John \"Black Jack\" Geary being a officer who has been stuck in stasis for a century. Much to his dismay, he finds out his heroic last stand has been elevated to Davey Crocket at the Alamo/King Arthur levels of proportion. So much so that he is treated as the Second Coming when he is finally rescued, as well as the man who is to deliver them from the same enemy he \"died\" fighting so many years ago.\n\nIt's not a bad premise, though I think Jack Campbell overdoes it. Tactics have degraded in the future to the point everyone just flies at the enemy and gets killed, he's constantly reminded of how awesome he is (while thinking he's not), and everyone who is skeptical of him is either evil or dramatically overreacting. One character assumes he's going to either get them all killed in a heroic attack or try to take over the Alliance. Despite this, I very much enjoyed the setting and liked the focus on the laws and customs of war. John is a person who comes from a more civilized time and is appalled by the treatment of prisoners in the present. I think few books bother to treat the \"enemy\" characters as anything but targets so this was a nice change of pace.\n\nThe starship battles are well-designed with a focus on fleet action as well as real-world tactics (applied to space) like formation, training, and the importance of discipline. Jack Campbell worked in the Navy and its influence on his work is obvious. It's nice to see someone who bucks the usual trend of military mavericks. Jack just wants a disciplined well-oiled machine and he's got a bunch of Leeroy Jenkins in starships.\n\nCharacterization-wise, most of the people involved are a bit broad. John Geary is the \"only sane man\" on the ship as everyone is just determined to kill the enemy by attacking relentlessly. He's also a subject of great suspicion by the civilian governments because they have no experience with any officers who don't have utter contempt for them. There's some similarities to Captain America as well as King Arthur with a moral paragon waking up to take the reigns, even as John is nothing like the tough-talking badass that history has made him out to be.\n\nI feel like there's some missed opportunities here as Jack never really takes time to mourn anyone who might have died while he was asleep as well as the sheer culture shock of waking up a century later. Instead, he's all business and his problems are primarily with how the Navy has degenerated into a band of pirates. I feel like giving him a Peggy Carter equivalent or have him react to his initial awakening would have been more interesting.\n\nOn the other hand, I have to say I'm very impressed with the villains. I very much enjoyed the idea of the enemy being an ultra-capitalist cyberpunk state run by corporations. That's something you don't see often in military science-fiction and while they mostly remain targets, they eventually do get fleshed out in future books (particularly the spin-offs).\n\nSpeaking as an author of space opera fiction, I'm always on the lookout for new or classic fiction in the genre to read. Mind you, I'm one of those lumps who originally had his exposure limited to Star Trek and Star Wars. I've always thought of it as a visual medium so while I love Babylon Five, Battlestar Galactica, Mass Effect, and Halo--I never quite got into the literary side of things. Well, you know, until I decided to write it myself. After writing Lucifer's Star, I did become an afficianado of military science fiction and have read many authors I've since come to love. Lost Fleet is an excellent example of the genre and one that was recommended to me many times before I picked it up.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an entertaining fun book even if it's not something that I absolutely felt I had to read. Still, if you're looking for deep characterization and a less-than-perfect hero then this isn't the series for you. On my end? I don't mind a little competence porn and read the entire series. Those who love big epic space battles and a guy trying to bring an unruly crew together will find a lot to love in these books. Dauntless is only the start of an epic series and it continues right until a truly epic climax (no spoilers). I should note that I listened to the audiobook and very much enjoyed its narration.",

        "title": "Opinion Piece: The Geralt-Yennefer Relationship is an Example of Bad Writing",
        "body": "Okay, now don't hate on me. THIS IS JUST AN OPINION ON SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC. I LOVE THE WITCHER. I'm just annoyed by what appears to be a poorly thought out aspect of an otherwise amazing show with great writing and remarkably witty and engaging dialogue.\n\nI simply believe the Geralt-Yennefer relationship was completely forced, just hamfisted into the story, and it is something that the author, Sapkowski, didn't put anywhere near enough thought into. He just  happened to creat two really interesting and distinct characters and suddenly thought, \"wow, it would be cool if these two characters fell in love. I could have this happen and this happen, and it'd be fun if they did this together, yada, yada, yada.\" If anyone can disprove me of this notion, please do, because I would love it if this wasn't the case. I love the show. \n\nYennefer is a great character, no doubt, but frankly she's a complete scumbag until she finishes her character arc. Geralt falling in love with her after all the terrible things she did to him and countless innocent townspeople, and her complete lack of any consideration for other peoples' lives, makes absolutely no sense. Geralt could have easily been executed if he didn't get lucky with that \"head bursting\" wish. She nearly killed him simply to get him out of her way and to get revenge on the city council members that simply wanted her to leave town and stop brainwashing people. She could have just put Geralt to sleep if she wanted him out of the way. But instead, she brainwashed him and sent him out to attack two city council member, knowing that would most certainly get him killed.  \n\nAny guy that falls in love with a woman like that is either a masochist or a very poorly written fictional character. \\[Also note that the city council members had every right to banish her. She was destroying peoples' lives, brainwashing them, and treating them like how a mentally disturbed 3-year-old treats her toys. But she still sent Geralt out to risk his life to attack them.\\]\n\nIt appears Sapkowski never thought up a good reason for Geralt to fall in love with Yennefer. It would make sense if Geralt had some sort of weird complex from his childhood where he was attracted to and protected by some similarly insane, power-hungry woman. Otherwise, it's just nonsense you need to overlook for the sake of the story.\n\nBut yeah, I looked up dozens of pages online trying to find a legitimate answer to the question, \"Why did Geralt fall in love with Yennefer\" and I've yet to encounter a single, viable answer. Sure, the Djinn debacle bonded their souls together. But that doesn't necessarily make two people fall in love.  Plus, Geralt clearly already had a crush on her well before the whole Djinn fiasco.\n\nIf the argument is that the whole thing is \"fake love\" forced upon them by soul bonding magic, you'd think Geralt or Yennefer would look for a way to undo said magic. If they didn't actually have any real reasons to respect each other, even in the slightest, you would think that at least one of them would see it as a curse and try to undo it. I don't see any reason for Geralt to respect Yennefer early in the story. She treats other human beings like trash and she regularly violates all the principles that define who he is as a person.",

Perhaps I'm looking too much into it but what the hell, speculating is fun. \n\nFirst of all, her hair is always perfect. The only time we saw her with messy unkept hair and those long strands hanging out was right after Sodden when she was in distress. I just can't imagine Tissaia showing up like that to an official meeting of all northern monarchs (ironically, Philippa has the same two strands hanging at the sides of her face when she speaks with Dijkstra). Secondly, the chair she sits in is that of Redania - the Redanian eagle is etched into the seat. And sure, perhaps it's because it's the only empty seat since Vizimir isn't there. Lastly, it just goes against the books in a very direct way because Tissaia would never do that nor had that storyline (yes, I know so much was already changed). But here, she seems hellbent on manipulating the council - it just feels like a Philippa thing to do.\n\nFinally, here's the official casting announcement for Philippa. \n\n>*Equal parts charming and conniving, Philippa Eilhart is a primary advisor to Redania’s King Vizimir. Her ability to figuratively — and literally —* ***shapeshift*** *through courts and parties alike makes her one of the most influential sorceresses within the Continent’s politics.* \n\nYes, we've only seen her as an owl. But why wouldn't it be possible that she can shapeshift into other people as well? Obviously, I very much doubt this is the actual case and it's just a BS theory most likely cause the writers don't seem like they'd do smth like this, but opinions on this? Do you think it's even slightly possible?",

        "body": "I wanted to talk a bit about the reasoning for the changes made to Yennefer and Ciri's relationship in the tv show, and get some other opinions regarding why it was written the way it was. BOOK (THE ENTIRE SERIES) AND SHOW SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt while watching the last few episodes of season 2 that a stronger version of the Geralt/Ciri dynamic was being given to us at the expense of the Yennefer/Ciri dynamic. Perhaps \"stronger\" is the wrong word, as their relationship is very strong in the books as well, but I think it's fair to say that it's given a bit more intensity in the show. One of the biggest scenes of the season is the one where Geralt holds his sword to Yennefer's throat while Yarpen quite pointedly asks him, \"yours?\" to which Geralt responds \"mine\". This clearly establishes Geralt and Ciri as being a duo, and Yennefer as an outsider. I think this is a huge mistake and misinterpretation of the dynamic between the three of them in the book, as in the source material all three relationships are formed in isolation from one another. This prevents any one character from feeling like a \"third wheel.\" However, now we are left with them being reunited already, and a sizable portion of the next season is probably going to be taken up by Yennefer earning Geralt and Ciri's trust back, which means her bonding time with Ciri is likely going to happen with Geralt hovering over them the entire time. This makes the dynamic between all three characters considerably more skewed in a single direction than it was in the novels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I think it's a damn shame, considering Ciri and Yennefer's bond was arguably stronger than Ciri and Geralt's in the source material. Of the three primary relationships, only Ciri and Yennefer's is bound simply by love and affection, rather than destiny. They are indirectly entwined via their respective connections to Geralt, of course, however the parental bond that exists between the two of them is the result of pure emotion, as Vilgefortz mentions to Yennefer towards the end of the series. Fate had no hand in them growing to consider one another family; it was a choice that they each made, and I think that makes it especially beautiful. To make Yennefer's relationship with Ciri a mere accessory to Geralt's is so disappointing when Yennefer is the only one that Ciri explicitly referred to as a parent, it is Yennefer's name that Ciri asks to take at the end of the last book, and it is Yennefer and Ciri's mutual desire to protect one another that leads to the climax of the series at Stygga Castle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it's also important to note that, in a discussion about media at large, Geralt and Ciri's dynamic is not particularly unique or special. This is not to say that it isn't enjoyable or well done, but rather that the found father-daughter dynamic can be seen all over the place. Now, there is a good reason for this: it generally works. It is a very popular trope because it is an easy way to get the audience to care about the characters and the relationship between them; watching a gruff, disillusioned man grow soft because of the parental bond he forms with a child under his protection is usually pretty surefire way to tug on the viewer's heartstrings. But again, it's not particularly special or unique. Yennefer's relationship with Ciri *is* special and unique, though. When is the last time you saw such a heartwarming, well-written depiction of a mother-daughter dynamic?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to give out a disclaimer before I finish off this post and assure you that I'm not trying to indicate that Yennefer and Ciri's relationship should get *more* attention than Geralt's dynamic with Ciri. Part of what's great about the books is the balance between the three of them, and how it really convinces you that they complete each other (three parts of a single whole!). I just feel as though they honed in on the Geralt/Ciri dynamic to the detriment of the Yennifer/Ciri dynamic. What do you all think?",
