        "body": " \n\n>“People,” Geralt turned his head, “like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live.”\n\n**So what’s the book about?**\n\nWhat does a Witcher do to earn the bread in the soup? How do you cure a man-eating princess of her unsavoury habit? And why is it advisable to have your home insured against magical and supernatural events? The Witcher Geralt is an expert when it comes to eliminating monsters, vampires and other troublesome monstrosities. His best friends are the witcher’s sword and the bard, with whom he roams the land in search of commissions. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to find work, as the spread of human cities leaves little room for mythical creatures. And despite his bloody profession, Witcher Geralt is by no means the callous and indifferent butcher his clients often think he is. His apparently unrequited love for the sorceress Yennefer gives him a humanity that he does not want to admit to himself. Moreover, it becomes increasingly clear to him that he, too, belongs to that dwindling realm of mythical creatures.\n\n**Why I wanted to read this series?**\n\nI have wanted to read the Witcher series for years, as it is very popular, especially in Germany, because the author is Polish and this is a country bordering Germany. Somehow I never managed to start this series, because it only begins with a short story volume and I’m not really a fan of short stories. However, the hype around the Witcher series grew, also through the video games and finally through the series. I was completely carried away by the series and I think Yennefer in particular is extraordinarily well done! I can’t wait for the second season to come out. Because I liked the series so much, I finally wanted to venture into the original roots.\n\n**These aspects attracted me the most while reading.**\n\n* There are very few world designs in fantasy that can lay claim to uniqueness and freshness, but do so with an almost terrifying credibility. Geralt of Riva and his world undoubtedly belong in this category. The creatures alone, inspired by Eastern European legends and myths, and the very special narrative voice, a welcome change from the otherwise typically Anglo-Saxon fantasy, fascinate from the very first page and give the reader the feeling of entering a very special, novel world. The different creatures that Geralt meets on his various jobs are extraordinarily well done, as a variety of creatures is given here, through vampires, djinni or yet creatures of his own design.\n* The protagonist Geralt is a witcher with honour, he follows a code, even if it is his own. His demeanour is always very authentic, he doesn’t mince his words and has an incredibly dry and sarcastically ironic sense of humour. Geralt of Riva is a multi-faceted character. He is emotionally broken due to the Witcher mutation. His environment and his suffering always makes him feel that he is different, an outcast and only created to kill monsters. The opinion of others is often important to him, because he keeps handicapping himself with it. That witchers like Geralt are emotionless is something Geralt is often told, which is why he also believes he has no real emotions. In reality, he cares about his friends and the people. Some jobs he does free, some monsters he doesn’t kill out of his own principles and often he asks for the welfare and advises his clients before asking for the money. Geralt is an adventurer who is comfortable in his easy life. He lives according to his own principles. Especially with his friend Dandelion, the famous bard, he engages in frequent exchanges of blows, in which both are in no way inferior to each other. Geralt angrily refuses to choose the lesser evil, who would so gladly maintain neutrality, bound by the Witcher’s Code – and then fails to do so, because he is not a mindless fighting machine, but a deeply moral, too often melancholic, all-questioning human being.\n* The best short story for me was The Last Wish. While catfishing, Dandelion and Geralt find a jar sealed with a magic lock, from which a djinn escapes, attracting the attention of the sorcerer Yennefer von Vengerberg, among others. She senses her chance to become even more powerful than she already is and forgets what cunning creatures these elemental spirits can be. While the djinn unleashes fury and destruction on the town, Geralt and the townspeople look for a way to get rid of the angry genie. I particularly liked this story because you get to know a little bit about Yennefer, who I simply took to my heart through the series.\n\n**So what are my final thoughts about it?**\n\nHonestly, I was disappointed with this book, although I didn’t have such high expectations either, as it is a short story collection, however, I liked the world and also Geralt very much, but every single short story was extremely sexual. Every story involved a good-looking woman, most of whom also had a large bust, who had to be rescued or who was involved in the story in some other way. Of course, the theme was then also eviscerated. I have nothing against sex scenes in a book or when sexual jokes or remarks are made, but in this book it was clearly too much for me, because really EVERY short story, this theme was taken up repeatedly. However, I liked this Eastern European fantasy world so much and Geralt is also a very interesting character that I want to continue reading this story, even if I hope that this obsessive sexual narration will stop. Therefore, I still have hope and will not give up on this series as I also want to know more about Geralt as he seems like a strong character. Please Witcher series do me a favour and make it a good story!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out my Book Blog: [https://thereadingstray.com/2021/06/24/the-last-wish-andrzej-sapkowski/](https://thereadingstray.com/2021/06/24/the-last-wish-andrzej-sapkowski/)",

        "title": "I just finished The Witcher book series and I’m curious as to whether people agree…?",
        "body": "I just finished The Witcher series (minus season of storms) after loving the Netflix show. \n\nIm usually a book first, movie/tvshow after type of girl but after watching the first season of The Witcher on Netflix, I had to get my hands on the books and dive deeper into The Witcher universe. I was somewhat disappointed… \n\nI started off with the 2 short story books, The Last Wish and Blood of Elves, which was essentially a recap of the 1st season. I didn’t mind them and actually quite enjoyed seeing the dynamic of Geralt + Ciri as they meet earlier on than the Tv show portrayed. I think this made their reunion at the end of blood of elves more meaningful, and excited me to begin the offical series. \n\nLike starting any new book series I was waiting for the moment to come where I felt as though I couldn’t put the book down; that up all night, page turning type of read.. but it never came. I think that was my main issue with the series is that I felt as though I could put it down whenever I wanted and I didn’t have the urge to pick the book up again. It was more of a get through this to find out what happens type of read. \n\nThe start of the first book began with Geralt and Ciri in Kaer Morhen, with Ciri in Witcher-training mode. I thought this was epic. We had already read about Geralts adventures as a Witcher and the thought of him training his child of surprise as his protégée, a female Witcher made me believe the rest of the series would lead to some tag team monster slaying action packed adventures between Geralt and Ciri. But unfortunately that never came. I understand that Ciri used a lot of her Witcher training and abilities throughout her storyline but the only moment which made me feel thrilled about her training was in Lady of the Lake where she uses the pendulum technique Geralt taught her to defeat Bonhart. \n\nIn fact, I was even disappointed in Ciri’s ability to use the magic that Yennifer taught her, in most of the series. Ciri was talked up as this powerful, promising being that everyone was after, and it turns out that they only wanted her for her future child… which never even happened (not that I wanted it to). It just felt to me like that Sapjowski had this witty, epic character, with Elven blood, magical abilities, and Witcher training, and decided to have her whole plot based around running away from people who were trying to capture her to use her for her womb. Ciri, as a character is great, she’s strong and went through so much, but I just feel as though there was a lack of direction in her plot. Which brings me to my next point… the plot. \n\nIt just felt underwhelming. The whole plot was basically this massive road trip of Geralt/Ciri/Yennifer trying to find their way back to each other against the back drop of political power plays and an ongoing war.  I mean, don’t get me wrong, it sounds great, however, I just felt that instead of it being intense, and leaving the reader on the edge of their seat, it was dragged out with a lot  of tedious nothings in between. \n\nI guess after watching the first season of the show, my expectations were different/higher than what the book’s presented. I expected this quest of Ciri, a trained Witcher and sorceress, reclaiming her throne and avenging her grandmother. And whilst she did go on quite the adventure, and experienced getting revenge (on Bonhart), it was not how I was expecting it to go down. \n\nI was also quite confused at a lot of the characters/countries/language as I felt like when new characters were introduced, it seemed as though Stokowski expected us to know who this character was, without giving any context. Usually, I don’t mind, and ah e read other books where this happens, but in this instance, it seemed like he would name drop 10 characters in 1 paragraph, only to never mention them again. \n\nI read somewhere that people seemed to have an issue with the non-linearity of the storyline and the different worlds but I actually didn’t mind this so much. I like when authors do weird things that make you think, “where the fuck did that come from?” It seemed a bit strange, that a few books in we all of a sudden hear about these other worlds, fantasy worlds, our worlds, the future and the jumps between past and present, but as mentioned I actually didn’t mind it. \n\nThe reunion: The Geralt/Ciri/Yennifer reunion was the best part of the series. It was the moment the readers were waiting for. Accompanied by the squad showdown with Milva, Cahir, Regis and Angeloume vs Bonhart and Vilgefortz was my favourite bit. And yet, even it felt as though it was somewhat rushed. All I kept thinking was that the TV show was going to absolute kill this scene (here’s hoping they get to it) and I couldn’t wait to see the shows portrayal. \n\nA few questions and comments had about the end. \n\nLoved the Emhyr/Duny twist. But was a little grossed out about the fact that he still wanted to marry Ciri (I know, I know it’s fantasy but still). And was a little confused at how he just left the real Ciri to be with the fake Ciri, and it was never explained? Like dude just started war and annhilated entire countries to get to Ciri, only to just leave her approx 5 mins after he got her. \n\nGeralt and Emhyr’s conversation about the Duny revelation and Geralt accepting his fate to die seemed a little un Geralt-like. I was expecting a bit more of a fight, and yet he and Yennifer just got into that tub ready to end it all?! \n\nAnd that ending! I don’t mind an open ending but I’m curious as to whether people believe that Yen and Geralt are alive or dead? Geralt remembers being in the boat and Yen was “unconscious” but I see that a lot of people think they died? Thoughts? \n\nAll in all, I think that whilst Stokowski world building was fantastic, I felt as though the plot itself was quite minimal. He did a great job at the characters, and their interactions, but I never got attached, or fell in love with any of the characters (minus dandelion) as I usually do when reading a series, even though I still really liked Yen/Ciri/Geralt. \n\nAs mentioned, I’m a firm believer in the book is always better but in this case I think that the book series serves as a leg for the show to stand on. As seen in the battle of Sodden hill and even the fall of Cintra, I think the show elevates the books and the characters, and really highlights what should have been more intense plots from the books. I’m excited to see how they portray the ratz, Ciri’s cat/mouse chase on the frozen lake, the reunion, the Vilgefortz showdown, and the Bonhart fight. \n\nAnyway, I’m curious as to what your thoughts are on the Witcher book series, and whether you agree/disagree with this review. \n\n\nPs. Apologies in advance as to my writing and formatting, it’s late, I’m tired and I’m also rambling.",

Ciri, as a character is great, she’s strong and went through so much, but I just feel as though there was a lack of direction in her plot. Which brings me to my next point… the plot. \n\nIt just felt underwhelming. The whole plot was basically this massive road trip of Geralt/Ciri/Yennifer trying to find their way back to each other against the back drop of political power plays and an ongoing war.  I mean, don’t get me wrong, it sounds great, however, I just felt that instead of it being intense, and leaving the reader on the edge of their seat, it was dragged out with a lot  of tedious nothings in between. \n\nI guess after watching the first season of the show, my expectations were different/higher than what the book’s presented. I expected this quest of Ciri, a trained Witcher and sorceress, reclaiming her throne and avenging her grandmother. And whilst she did go on quite the adventure, and experienced getting revenge (on Bonhart), it was not how I was expecting it to go down. \n\nI was also quite confused at a lot of the characters/countries/language as I felt like when new characters were introduced, it seemed as though Stokowski expected us to know who this character was, without giving any context. Usually, I don’t mind, and ah e read other books where this happens, but in this instance, it seemed like he would name drop 10 characters in 1 paragraph, only to never mention them again. \n\nI read somewhere that people seemed to have an issue with the non-linearity of the storyline and the different worlds but I actually didn’t mind this so much. I like when authors do weird things that make you think, “where the fuck did that come from?” It seemed a bit strange, that a few books in we all of a sudden hear about these other worlds, fantasy worlds, our worlds, the future and the jumps between past and present, but as mentioned I actually didn’t mind it. \n\nThe reunion: The Geralt/Ciri/Yennifer reunion was the best part of the series. It was the moment the readers were waiting for. Accompanied by the squad showdown with Milva, Cahir, Regis and Angeloume vs Bonhart and Vilgefortz was my favourite bit. And yet, even it felt as though it was somewhat rushed. All I kept thinking was that the TV show was going to absolute kill this scene (here’s hoping they get to it) and I couldn’t wait to see the shows portrayal. \n\nA few questions and comments had about the end. \n\nLoved the Emhyr/Duny twist. But was a little grossed out about the fact that he still wanted to marry Ciri (I know, I know it’s fantasy but still).

Like dude just started war and annhilated entire countries to get to Ciri, only to just leave her approx 5 mins after he got her. \n\nGeralt and Emhyr’s conversation about the Duny revelation and Geralt accepting his fate to die seemed a little un Geralt-like.

        "title": "I just finished The Witcher book series and I’m curious as to whether people agree…?",
        "body": "I just finished The Witcher series (minus season of storms) after loving the Netflix show. \n\nIm usually a book first, movie/tvshow after type of girl but after watching the first season of The Witcher on Netflix, I had to get my hands on the books and dive deeper into The Witcher universe. I was somewhat disappointed… \n\nI started off with the 2 short story books, The Last Wish and Blood of Elves, which was essentially a recap of the 1st season. I didn’t mind them and actually quite enjoyed seeing the dynamic of Geralt + Ciri as they meet earlier on than the Tv show portrayed. I think this made their reunion at the end of blood of elves more meaningful, and excited me to begin the offical series. \n\nLike starting any new book series I was waiting for the moment to come where I felt as though I couldn’t put the book down; that up all night, page turning type of read.. but it never came. I think that was my main issue with the series is that I felt as though I could put it down whenever I wanted and I didn’t have the urge to pick the book up again. It was more of a get through this to find out what happens type of read. \n\nThe start of the first book began with Geralt and Ciri in Kaer Morhen, with Ciri in Witcher-training mode. I thought this was epic. We had already read about Geralts adventures as a Witcher and the thought of him training his child of surprise as his protégée, a female Witcher made me believe the rest of the series would lead to some tag team monster slaying action packed adventures between Geralt and Ciri. But unfortunately that never came. I understand that Ciri used a lot of her Witcher training and abilities throughout her storyline but the only moment which made me feel thrilled about her training was in Lady of the Lake where she uses the pendulum technique Geralt taught her to defeat Bonhart. \n\nIn fact, I was even disappointed in Ciri’s ability to use the magic that Yennifer taught her, in most of the series. Ciri was talked up as this powerful, promising being that everyone was after, and it turns out that they only wanted her for her future child… which never even happened (not that I wanted it to). It just felt to me like that Sapjowski had this witty, epic character, with Elven blood, magical abilities, and Witcher training, and decided to have her whole plot based around running away from people who were trying to capture her to use her for her womb. Ciri, as a character is great, she’s strong and went through so much, but I just feel as though there was a lack of direction in her plot.

        "title": "The Faithful and the Fallen series review (spoiler free)",
        "body": "Another post about The Faithful and the Fallen you might think? Yes, sorry. I know this series gets talked about often lately, but John Gwynne deserves all the attention.\n\nI finished this series yesterday after almost two months reading, and I need to gush and talk about it before I can start reading anything else. **There are no spoilers in this review!**\n\nThe series consists of four novels: Malice, Valour, Ruin, and Wrath.\n\nNow, I'm going to be honest and say that I had several issues with the first book Malice, and from what I've seen many people share this opinion. For me Malice is a 3,5 out of 5 stars. It starts very slow and the constant shifting between new POV:s in different parts of the world was quite jarring. It wasn't really until halfway through that I really started to connect with the characters. But the plot starts picking up and the final third is just amazing.\n\nAfter the climax of Malice, Gwynne never takes his foot off the gas. The whole series is just non-stop action. In the cons section below I'll discuss some of my issues with the series, but the Faithful and the Fallen is really one of those series where you just have to enjoy the ride. It's such an amazing journey.\n\nI promise you, even if you are one of those readers who struggles with Malice, you will come to love this series. You will not regret reading it.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\nThe characters! Granted, I'm still relatively new to the genre but I haven't read any books with more likeable characters than the protagonists in TFatF. They aren't perhaps as interesting as Abercrombie's characters, but they are simply so likeable. I can't find a better word. They are kind and courageous, loyal to each other, and you'll grow to love them, and your heart will break for all the tragedies they go through, and when they die. Because yeah, many of them will die. No one is safe in the god-war.\n\nThe series also has some of the most hateable villains ever. We are talking Dolores Umbridge levels here. You'll know when you read all the awful things these guys do.\n\nThe battle scenes! John Gwynne is simply the best at writing action. Better than Abercrombie (yes Abercrombie is the standard I hold every author to). There is a duel in one of the later books that is one the most impressive pieces of action I've every read in any fiction. There are also plenty of large scale battles and Gwynne really knows how to put you in the middle of it and feel like you're ducking from every sword blow yourself.\n\nLove and family! Something I just have to give Gwynne a standing ovation for is how he writes love between family and friends. This is one of the reasons why you will love the characters so much. There are so many small but moving scenes in these books and they felt so *real*. I haven't really read stuff like that before.\n\nNow, the romances are so-so but there is one between two middle age characters, and this one was so well done. I absolutely love a romance where the two people have to go through so much pain and tragedy to be together (for example Geralt and Yennefer in The Witcher), and the romance I'm referring to here was just like that. Really good stuff.\n\nAnimal companions! If you love animal companions you will surely love this series. I'll not go into this too much, but you will love these animals as much as any human character. Never thought I'd love a crow so much.\n\n\n**Neutral:**\n\nTropes – yes this series are full of them. The Faithful and the Fallen doesn't bring anything new to the genre but it just does everything so well. You'll definitely feel like you read some things before,  but Gwynne makes you forget about it and enjoy the ride.\n\nThe pacing! There is absolutely no fluff whatsover in these books. Yes, Malice starts slow because it has to introduce so much, but there is no filler. I put this in neutral because I see both pros and cons with this. Personally, I wouldn't have minded more filler and scenes where the characters just sit around a fire drinking mead and chatting. I wanted more character moments, but I came into this series after reading six of Abercrombie's novels in a row, so Gwynne's fast pace took some time to adjust to. He isn't afraid of doing a lot of time jumps either, there will be a lot of ”a ten-night later”. But, this speeds the plot along nicely. Gwynne tells his story, and he tells it well.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nThe chapters are very short, like five pages on average (and I read on an E-reader). Generally I like this, but I felt, especially in Malice, that every one of these five page chapters consisted of three or four short scenes, often with time jumps in between, That was a bit jarring, and made it difficult to connect with the characters at the beginning because we were constantly moving from event to event. It felt a bit like just reading the highlights of the story. Now, this did get better in the second book, and I felt that the narrative was much tighter in the rest of the series, and in the third book the chapters were actually much longer on average.\n\nWorld building – This was really nothing special at all. I always got the sense that the Banished  Lands were quite empty and depopulated, even though we visit every nation, But, like I said, there is no filler and everything is about the plot and enjoying the ride. This has its cons of course, because I would have loved to know more about the history of every nation and their cultures. Unfortunately, all the different nations felt a bit copy and paste. The only real difference was that they drank wine in the south, mead in the west, and ale in the north. Oh, and they have sandals in the south, not boots.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Faithful and the Fallen is an amazing series. You read these books for the adventure and action, and the easy to love characters, and after a bumpy start you will enjoy this ride like no other.\n\nI have felt so emotionally invested in these books and the climax of the final book was so good, yet devestating. I am an almost 30 year old man and I bawled my eyes out several times at the end of Wrath, simply because I was so attached to these characters and it hurt to experience all the tragedy with them.\n\nThis series is without a doubt a 5/5. I have a serious book hangover now, but it felt good to share some thoughts about it. Hopefully you will also give this series a chance and join the warband.\n\n**Truth and courage!**",

        "body": "So i was thinking, if the show ever wants to adapt the \\*Shard of ice\\* story, this season or right at the start of season 3 would be their last chance to do so. >!After the coup it wouldn't really make sense for Geralt to duel Istredd when Ciri is missing.!<\n\nIf Geralt and Yen meet again i think it would make sense for Geralt to be struck with love and jealousy.  Maybe a shard of ice is even the secret episode for season 2, though i dont know if it would really make sense to have it be the very last episode of the season. >!Geralt's fight with Rience makes more sense as a bombastic end.!<\n\nPerhaps instead, \\*Shard of ice\\* will be the first episode of season 3, just like how \\*A grain of truth\\* will be the first episode of season 2. Then in the next episode >!Yen and Ciri could travel to Gors Velen and the whole \\*Time of Contempt\\* story kicks in.!<\n\nOr maybe it would be better for the show not to try and squeeze in the short story in the main saga at all? Its a shame that they didnt do it last season, i think its a great story for Geralt and Yen's relationship.",

        "body": "Her journey in the books was really tough. At least three factions wanted to abduct her for her reproductive organs. With topics like rape, humiliation and terror on many occasions.\n\nI think most of this was important for her character development. What i remember most is that she often shifted between two extremes. Sometimes being completely badass and then sometimes breaking down, being very vulnerable and at the mercy of others. All this suffering caused the badass to take over more and more and she became more powerful and confident. But it also traumatized her deeply. To me it seemed like something had died inside her at the end. A bit like Frodo and his mental scars in LotR, only worse.\n\nI feel like the show won't include the more extreme stuff like Bonhart parading naked Ciri around on a collar while decapitating all her friends. Or Ciri getting rescued by Mistle from being sexually abused by the other Rat gang member, only to get taken advantage of immediately after. I believe there was a scene where she gave herself to a dying stranger because she expected to die soon anyway and wanted to \"live\" by at least loosing her virginity, but then he passed during the act. That was crazy disturbing.\n\nIt would be so courageous if the showrunners would not shy away from such topics. They have a chance to create the best villains ever if they actually put Ciri in these situations. Can you even imagine how deeply the audience would hate Bonhart, Skellen and Vilgefortz? The emotional investment could be insane.\n\nThe show would also feature some of the best female heros and they would all have a mostly believable personal growth. Not like all the boring instantly overpowered heroines which are everywhere these days (Rey in Star Wars). Yennefer's story in season 1 already gave me some hope but somehow i doubt that the writers or the Ciri actress are able and willing to go this far. It would require to show phases of ultimate weakness of a female hero on screen. Seems like a no-go with today's zeitgeist. Would be so great if they just did it anyway and got confirmed by overwhelming applause afterwards. The horrors don't need to be too graphical. It's just important that they even exist.\n\nCiri's story needs to include great suffering and many moments where she gets utterly broken. She was never a badass female witcher. She was only a child which had to grow up too quickly because she experienced too much disturbing stuff.",

We've got Vilgefortz's players, Lydia and Rience - not to mention all the other mages from S1. Francesca's background has been expanded as well. There's the story of Falka and Lara Dorren. Nivellen is included and Istredd is also gonna be appearing again. And then we've got the trio - Geralt and Ciri at Kaer Morhen and then Yennefer who I'm guessing will be our PoV into the mage politics which are clearly going to be playing a prominent role this year (probably a set up for S3).\n\nAnd while I am excited for all of this and to see their take on it, is anyone else worried that at some point, it's going to become too much? They only have eight episodes after all. Also, speaking of, what's the thing you're most looking forward to?\n\nFor me, it's def the underhanded politics of the Continent and all the players.",

You have the like of Fitz, Kylar Stern, and others who have extensive training similar to Geralt, but on the flip side of the coin Harry Potter would suddenly be a skinny kid with a stick, Superman would probably collapse under the unexpected exhaustion of what living like a regular human can be like, and Gandalf would probably just turn to ash, right?\n\nSo who would win, if you stripped them of all the supernatural and had a \"survival of the fittest\"?\n\n(For the sake of argument, let's say that each character starts video-game \"naked\", san equipment, in a large, varied world with multiple historical, fantastical, and modern settings like forests, castles, cities, etc... So Batman wouldn't get the Bat Cave, but he would get access to modern materials, and Geralt would get access to familiar plants and the like).",

        "body": "I had always speculated that Season 2 would like end with the Thanedd 'incident'. As it only occurs in the 4th chapter of the book after BoE, so it might make sense to extent a little past BoE and make it the climax of season 2. However the leaks don't seem to suggest this will happen until next season. \n\nSo my question is, where do you think/where do you hope season 2 will end on as a climactic story point? As season 1 ended with Geralt and Ciri's union and Yennefers stand against Nilfgaard.\n\nI personally loved Yennefers climax to season 1 as we'd built up throughout the whole season how much 'chaos' and raw power was built up inside her. And whilst her standing against Nilfgaard wasn't built up to; the unleashing of her raw power certainly was and that's why it worked so well. Hopefully season 2 cam deliver in the same way.",

Although the Lesser Evil short story suffered some damaging changes, the exchanges between those two characters were great. The dialogue felt interesting, compelling and clever, and both actors did an amazing job. I believe that those scenes were Henry Cavill at his best while portraying Geralt: his appearance was really rugged (the armor looked quite worn) and his wig was just great, even better than in the images we got of season 2 in my opinion. His face was dirty as well, which really helped to nail it in my opinion. I just hope that in season two we get more scenes as well written as those, because in season one we got some pretty weird dialogues.",

        "body": "It's in the title. The books are so rich with even short sentences making way for entire storylines. The show... excluded a huge amount. It's one thing to change stuff but to outright dismiss and not even use written material is even worse imo. \n\nI've got too many of those, like Geralt going to Sodden Hill in mourning, the battle at Sodden itself and the lack of horrors described by Triss, Brokilon but what definitely takes the cake for me is how they wrote Geralt and Yennefer in the show, specifically the ending of 1x06 and the continuing episodes - it made it impossible for their last Belleteyn meeting before Sodden to take place or to even pretend that it happened off-screen. It was such a beautiful chapter, made sad by the fact that they didn't see each other again before Sodden. \n\nHad the show done this instead of repeating the Cintra stuff and having Yen get schoolgirls high, their relationship would have had much more depth than what little we got, especially before the S1 finale. I remember when the trailer came out, with the shot of Yen and Geralt meeting at the orgy - I was certain this was that scene. It's a small point in the overall story yet it would have been a much better idea for 1x07 than what we got, especially if they had also made Sodden more brutal and closer to the books. \n\nI wish that at the very least, they gave the implication of this having taken place between 1x06 and Yen heading to meet with Istredd. Yet as things stand, it doesn't seem like this ever happened. \n\nAnyways, I'm sure every or most book fans on this sub have a scene they wanted to see only for it to be completely omitted, hence the post.",

They have their Shard of Ice fight later, either before or after Geralt receives the ‘Dear Friend’ letter in the self same episode in place of the kestrel\n* Yennefer makes a deal with Fringilla or Francesca (possibly a duo) to trade off Ciri for something (probably the ability to regrow her womb since Francesca is pregnant), which is why she meets her in Ellander, though she later breaks the deal and runs off with Ciri and Geralt\n* Lambert and Eskel are flipped roles. Lambert will be Geralt’s close comrade, while Eskel will be bitey and standoffish, eventually being killed by the Leshy in Kaer Morhen\n* The Leshy in Kaer Morhen was being used in the lab either in experiments or for something to do with the Trial of Grasses. (hinted at by Lauren in the Nightmare of the Wolf commentary) It is a mutated variant.\n* Triss will relay to Geralt that Yennefer is (presumed) dead, adding to his belief after he and Ciri ride through Sodden after the battle.

I love the cast, more or less. I love some of the episodes. I hate episode 2 and 5. I don’t really like much of any designs in the show. (everybody looked so plain and generic for me) I can go on and on, but here I want to talk about how Jaskier did not age at all throughout the show.\n\nSome people seem to have a little problem understanding the timeline of the show because there is no implication that witchers and mages and sorceresses did not age. However that is quite forgivable, people can somehow assume. But Jaskier, this man did not age a day since he first met Geralt.\n\nI think for the show’s timeline. Geralt first met Jaskier when the bard is only 18 in 1240. By then, Joey Batey already looked 25-30 (I believe he was around 29 when the show was in shooting). I think we could use some makeup/hairstyling/cgi to make him appear younger. The next time we see Geralt with Jaskier is in ep4 which is set in 1249. It’s been 9 years, and Jaskier did not change one bit (though we could say that he looked more his age then). 6 years later, Jaskier was already 34 accompanying Geralt in ep5, yet he still looked exactly like he did when he was 18. Hunting Golden Dragon, Jaskier was 40 years old. Joey could use some wrinkles/a bit of change in his fashion taste/ beard/ etc. to make him look older than his age.\n\nThis also happened with characters like Calanthe, Mousesack, and Eist, which, unless they are Dúnedain, really bugged me (No worry, I also think that game’s Dandelion appeared to be a lot younger than his age, too).\n\nI understand that the show wanted to play with us about the surprise in concept of parallel stories between different time, but it just doesn’t make sense.\n\nAlso, Foltest is already a fat grumpy old man in 1243 in the show (instead of inteoducing him around 1250s like in the books), oh my god, imagine 20 years later, he had to lead the Temerian against Nilfgaard. How old would he be then.\n\nI hope that the next next seasons will take character’s age in mind to some extent. Don’t let it be the first thing that will limit writings and other things, but don’t treat it like it was nothing.",

        "body": "I made a post about this subject about a year or so ago and I didn't get the greatest of responses so I'll try this again and go into a bit more detail into what I'm looking for.\n\nYennefer of Vengerberg is one of my favorite characters in all of Fantasy, and I really want to find other works that have characters similar to her. I thought maybe if I explain in detail what I really love about her character it might help to better understand what I'm looking for.\n\n\\- First of all, I've always gravitated towards powerful, strong female characters, especially in fantasy.  Both powerful from a raw power standpoint, and powerful from a character standpoint.  I grew up watching shows like He-Man, She-Ra, Thundercats, and even non-fantasy like GI-Joe, and in those shows it was always the powerful women I gravitated towards.  For instance, in He-Man I always cared more about Teela, the sorceress, or even Evil-lyn over characters like He-man himself.\n\n\\- I'm also much more into magic users in fantasy then other archetypes like warriors or thieves.  Being able to fight with your mind is always more appealing to me then swinging a sword or firing a gun or bow.\n\n\\- I also like characters that can solve problems with words rather then always using brute force, especially in the fantasy genre where brute force seems to always be option 1.\n\n\\- Now there are plenty of characters with the characteristics listed above, but what really puts Yennefer over the top for me is that she's basically an anti-hero, especially in the games.  She's still basically on the \"good\" side but she's willing to do basically anything to protect those she cares about.  She also doesn't suffer fools at all.  Two scenes from the Witcher 3 game illustrate this... one where she uses necromancy to get information about Ciri and winds up basically tainting the area forever.  Also what she does when she learns Geralt cheated on her (even though he lost his memory).  The way she's able to hold her own in a castle full of mutated supermen... just brilliant IMO.\n\nNow some characters that I like and come close to Yen, but not quite:\n\n**Morrigan from Dragon Age.** The closest character I've come across.  A bit more on the anti side of anti-hero. I also love Claudia Black's voicework for her.  Alas, the character is from games only and not books.\n\n**Moiraine from Wheel of Time.**  Has everything but the moral ambiguity.  And is kinda boringly aromantic.\n\n**Sypha from the animated Castlevania series.**  Her badassery and relationship with Belmont reminds me a lot of Yen and Geralt.  She is however all hero though.\n\n**Vin from Mistborn.**  Not quite. She's also more of an arcane trickster then a sorceress due to the magic system of the world.\n\n**The Lady from Black Company.**  This gets recommended a lot but I can't get through enough of it and I'm not a huge grimdark fan.  Plus from what I hear she starts as a full on villain.\n\nSo yeah, if anyone has any recommendations (after reading my post!) please let me know.",

        "body": "Hello there,\n\nWith some luck you may have seen my Witcher cosplay pas here recently (so happy with all the positive responses, makes me excited to go to FACTS, that's ComicCon in Belgium).\n\nI just have one question up for debate. I will be wearing coloured contact lenses since as we know, Witchers have mutated cat eyes. Now I am hesitating between:\n\n\\- yellow/orange normal eyes\n\n\\- yellow/orange cat eyes\n\nNow Witcher eyes function like a cat, so in bright light they'll be slits, like you see with Geralt in the game most of the time. So I would lean more towards that. But a fellow cosplayer did a beautiful Young Vezemir with orange normal eyes and it looked great.\n\nSo I'm setting this up for debate. Normal eyes or Cat eyes?",

Little throw away things like the Dwarf guard letting you into the warehouse because you know Yarpen Zigrin or breaking the love \"curse\" from the Last Wish with Yennefer just really hit home.

His whole reason for deciding to search for Ciri in a beneficial way is because he starts having romantic/sexual dreams about her and thinks he’s fallen in love with her from those dreams. \nShe’s 16 at the time. Even though Cahir in the books is a few years younger it’s still super creepy! And I know that Ciri would probably be 18 instead of 16 at that point in the show, it would still be creepy! \n\nI sincerely hope that one of the reasons that Cahir was cast a little bit older than he is in the books is because the show is not going to go in that direction with him. If he still ends up switching to Team Geralt, which I’m definitely on board with, I *strongly* hope that it’s not because of a romantic interest in Ciri. I can’t help but feel like there are many other great possibilities to explore as reasons for him to desert Nilfgaard.",

        "title": "Anna Shaffer talks about Triss in Season 2 + a few S1 anecdotes (Panel at Eastern Europe ComicCon)",
        "body": "Today, August 28th, Anna Shaffer was a guest at two panels in Romania, at the [Eastern Europe ComicCon](https://comic-con.ro/), where people present there were able to ask her some questions.\n\nThe full rediffusions of the panels are available on YouTube ([Part 1](https://youtu.be/ULCZ6GM-6mY) and [Part 2](https://youtu.be/TPCpHPL1T1A)).\n\nHere are the highlights of what she said about her work on The Witcher:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Her most difficult scene was the **meeting of Triss and Geralt**, because it was a night shoot and it was very cold. *\"I was fighting to not freeze on the spot\"*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6uilp50t5k71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a0e4d4e830975f9dfb69325739ca1b970140b4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She praises the camera work of S1 but implies that there were sometimes not very flattering angles for Triss, that's something they worked on in S2. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Three things** she loves the most about Triss:\n   * The way she is **connected to heart and to nature**, something Anna relates to.\n   * Her **emotional nature**, that connects her to people but can also lead to not being able to control these feelings. She likes this contrast.\n   * Her **kind personality**, her actions coming from duty and kindness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Her favorite set of S1 is **the beach with the black rocks** in Episode 8 (the pre-Sodden scene).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvl8aauat5k71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=98595320d253b9a8c2247d04cb7e2361e434bbf0\n\n* About the **controversies about Triss**:\n\n>*\"I think it’s interesting – people have varied opinions about Triss. Which I understand. And the great thing about books and drama in general is that you can have your own interpretation of a character. So I hope that what I’ve been able to do is bring something a little bit different. Some people like it, some people don’t, but that’s life.”* \n\n* When the host brought up the issue of **toxic fandom**, Anna added: “People get irate. Get a life.\" \n* Anna says that getting season 2 is great because it gives them an opportunity to convince more people about her version Triss a second time. \n\n>*\"Maybe we didn’t win everyone the first time, but we’ll give another go for S2, we’ll see what happens. You never want to disappoint anyone of course, but I think there also should be a new take on the interpretation of the character, to find something that the fans didn’t thought initially but might like. So I think you expect them to come with an open-mindedness\".*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Anna says Season 2 is very exciting:\n\n>*It has a different feel to it, a different costume design, a different make-up design, but we keep what people loved about S1 but adding something different a bit fresher.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Anna prefers playing in **scenes with a lot of actors** because it's easier to fit into the flow of the filming, compared to more intimate dialogues where she has a bigger responsability with handling the scene's emotion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etdyyh1st5k71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=06552a21cf00d3ca8d162ec06dd6de30ead65624\n\n* In season 2, she worked a bit more on **Triss' harshness** actually.\n\n>*\"We leave Triss very seriously injured, it affects her a lot physically and mentally so what we get to see in S2 is a different journey for her. One where she takes ownership over her life a bit more.\"*\n\nShe says that after the consequences for her character at Sodden, it was important **to bring nuance to Triss' kind nature**. \"*Finding a darker side for Triss was tough but really rewarding in the end.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Anna did read the Witcher books, but didn't play the games. She plans to though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Anna addresses the expectations about Triss in the show:\n\n>*\"One of the problems when S1 came out was that a lot of game fans thought it would be a replica of the game, but we are adapting books. Ultimately fantasy is fantasy, it can have a little bit of fun and have a different on take on…looks, for example.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* About **working on the show**:  \nShe says that it's not that different than what she worked on before, she makes the parallel with Harry Potter (*Anna played Romilda Vane in the movies)* since it's also a fantasy work with elements of real life.  \nThe difference is that the Continent is much bigger world, the sets and costumes are various and incredibles and *\"really transport you there*\".\n* and about **working with Henry**:  \n*\"Working with Henry was great because he is lovely and right for this character\".*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nj92zg97u5k71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be8dfcd1d5ea8af3090fa3a8dbcef47557a2a87\n\n* She was asked about exploring Geralt/Triss relationship in S2. She said she is unfortunately not allowed to answer but she implies that it will be the case. *\"I know what you mean\"*, she replied to the person who asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She hints at **her interaction with other actors in S2** (without saying who exactly), and also talks about an emotional scene of S2 she's playing in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And that's it for this summary! You can find the links to the panels videos right here:** [**Part 1**](https://youtu.be/ULCZ6GM-6mY) **and** [**Part 2**](https://youtu.be/TPCpHPL1T1A)**.**",

But Nightmare of the Wolf definitely did. Maybe in part due to the vivid animation and the epic voice acting (Graham McTavish is a voice acting legend and Theo James is epic too), but the conflict between Witchers and people was more emphasized as well as its tragic implications. Plus Vesemir's character development was stunning, as good as if we'd just watched a whole season and not just a 1 hr 23 min movie of him. That he still felt the same way about Illyana despite her aged state and the years of hedonism he spent between their last interactions, that was deep.",

        "body": "I usually don't really care that much about generic procedurals, let alone sit down to discuss episodes, but this one wasn't just bad. It offended me in a way no other episode of tv has managed to. So I had to talk about it. \n\nThe story starts like a typical episode of that show with a girl saying she was raped in college. Only this time, she is the niece of one of the team members. The college believes her and expells him for a year even though the evidence is aknowledge to be subpar later in the episode. Then they try to criminally prosecute him\n\nIn the start, it seems like it will be a typical case of the team trying to find an alternative way of legally nailing a rapist. Not very original, but could still be entertaining.\n\nBut then the niece admits that she lied about the allegation because she regretted having drunk sex with him and was ashamed. And that's when I thought the episode could be really interesting in adressing the other side of rape accusations, which is false allegations and the destructive nature of blindly believing an alleged victim just because of gender bias. It could also explore the moral difficulty of dealing with a rape allegation and balancing between supporting an alleged victim and conducting due dilligence to actually find if it's true as well as the difficulty that often allegations are just based on a \"he said-she said\" between the two parties\n\nBut nope the episode doesn't do that. Instead, it pulls of the stupidest stunt I've ever seen. Instead of focusing on the impact of the allegations and the team trying to fix things, they have the kid ACTUALLY RAPE HER out of rage to get revenge for her ruining his life. \n\nThe episode continues to be one sided later, when we have a scene where the main cop basically says to a prosecutor he is a bad person for not wanting to take a case where he will likely lose and she goes on an entire preachy monologue on why it is important for victims to be heard even if they don't win a conviction. And then in the actual trial, the judge constantly tries to restric the lawyer of the guy for badgering the alleged victim and even gives her a contempt fine, while letting the prosecutor badger the defendant in the exact same manner\n\nWe also have a part where the girl is conviced to lie on the stand and say both rapes were true to not give him any mitigating factors. And she faces no consequence for it because \"what he did to her is far worse than what she did\". Never mind she commited perjury we need to have our faux empowering ending\n\nOh and for the cherry on top, in the final scene of the courtroom, they have the accused guy who was portrayed as very sympathetic in the rest of her, go in a rant about political correctness and honor acting like an alt right troll for no reason \n\nWhat.the.fuck. What was the message of this stinking episode? Because all I got is \"even if a guy isn't a rapist he will eventually be a rapist because all men subconciously want to rape\". It's the most shameless stupid piece of propaganda I have ever seen. This kind of ideological bullshit  is why rape victim support has turned into witch hunts and why metoo constantly loses credibility \n\nThis episode thinks it's empowering and sending a positive message about supporting victims but all it does is encourage false rape accusations giving young girls the message \"it's ok to accuse and ruin that guy you regret fooling around with. Because even if he didn't rape you now, he will eventually\"\n\nFuck this episode. I sincerely hope whoever wrote this piece of garbage gets a false rape accusation at some point in their lives to see how it feels",

It’s confusing me, because I don’t ever remember it being stated outright that Nilfgaard is an elven empire or human empire. I had always assumed it was elven because it seems that Elves are always speaking in high regard of Nilfgaard, and all the humans look at Nilfgaard as inferior, just like elves. But watching the show all the people from Nilfgaard don’t have elven ears. But really the only Nilfgaardian we really meet is Cahir. \n\nAm I reading too much into things and it’s simply a human empire? Am I dumb for thinking it’s elven?",

        "title": "My review/thoughts of the entire Witcher series. DAY 1: THE BOOKS",
        "body": "Over the next three days I will be posting my reviews/thoughts on all the Witcher content that I have consumed over the past 2 years. Here is Day 1: THE BOOKS\n\nThe book series as a whole: (4.5/5) I think Sapkowski is an expert when it comes to dialogue. The dialogue throughout the series is probably more action packed than even the war scenes that take place in “The Lady of the Lake.” The conversations between characters can be so funny yet so philosophical all at the same time. Each character has a distinct voice and their personality is perfectly portrayed through Sapkowski’s intelligent dialogue. The next strength is the action sequences. I don’t think I have read another book series where the author described the action sequences better than Sapkowski. It is like he is painting a picture in my head and I can visualize the movements like I am watching interpretive dance. Sapkowski implements a lot of character work into his stories as well, and allows characters to grow, fall, or remain stubbornly stagnant, in a very natural way. However, nobody is without flaw, and something that Sapkowski lacks in is describing the world around the characters. It almost feels at times that he spends so much time with characters he forgets that they are talking or fighting in a living, breathing, world. Nonetheless the Witcher series is an excellent product from an excellent writer and I highly recommend it.\n\nThe Last Wish: (4.5/5) Starting off “The Last Wish” really brings it’s “A” game and gives you a real taste of what is in store for you with the Witcher Series. Each short story is enticing and shows you the various flavors of the universe. It introduces you to the never ending moral and ethical dilemmas that Geralt keeps finding himself in while also hinting at the larger overarching story that will be tackled in the five-book saga. It also shows you how intelligent Geralt actually is and how philosophical he can be, much unlike the Geralt we see in the video games and television series. (If you did not know Geralt’s vocabulary and opinions far exceeds “hmm” or “winds howling”) The only issues that I had were the moments where I found myself confused on when exactly a story was taking place in relation to everything else, but this was not a consistent issue. My favorite Chapter in this book has to be “The Lesser Evil.” This chapter perfectly sums up Geralt, and his perspective of the world; and is quintessential to his decision making down the road. This chapter was adapted into the television series, and they made minor tweaks to the story which fundamentally changed its message and meaning which I find to be heartbreaking.\n\nSword of Destiny: (4/5) The Sword of Destiny, at least for me, slows down from the momentum that was created in “The Last Wish” Its opening chapters are fine, but it really begins to pick up near the end with the titular chapter “Sword of Destiny” and “Something More.” This book, more so than “The Last Wish” really sets up and plants the seeds for the upcoming five book saga. Sapkowski begins to flesh out Ciri as a character and really does a great job with the banter that takes place between her and Geralt. The final moments of this book are crazy and my heart was beating so fast that by the end of the book I went out to purchase “Blood of Elves.” Unlike the televised adaptation, the reunion of Ciri and Geralt is totally earned, but I will go into more detail about that when I post my review of the television series. The biggest strength Sword of Destiny has to offer is the amount of emotional depth it adds to Sapkowski’s world. Specifically, with chapters like “A Shard of Ice” and “A Little Sacrifice” these chapters make it known that Geralt is not without emotion, he has a heart and continues to have emotional stakes  with each conflict he comes across. The comedy in this book is also outstanding, the jacket scene in “Eternal Flame” will never not make me laugh. Geralt being shattered that Dandelion does not like his new outfit is absolutely hilarious to me. On the flipside, this book's weakness is a lack of sense of direction. I think that comes with it being a collection of short stories, but “The Last Wish” countered this with “The Voice of Reason” which wove together all the short stories. I feel like “Sword of Destiny'' would have really benefited if Sapkowski did something like that.\n\nBlood of Elves: (3.5/5) “Blood of Elves, in my opinion, may be the weakest book, but that is totally ok. It is meant to set up the five-book saga while also getting readers comfortable with the fact that the storyline is no longer being told through short stories. I think Sapkowski does a really good job at this with having two very interesting training montages at the start, with Ciri’s Witcher training, and near the end with her Sorceress training. There is also a phenomenal chapter with several northern queens and kings getting together talking about the world and what to do about Nilfgaard. Which brings me to its greatest strength, world building. There is so much world building in this book it is insane, almost to the point where it becomes a fault. We get a lot of info on the Scoia’tael during the caravan scenes with Yarpen. We receive a lot of info on Witchers in Kaer Morhen, and the Magic system through Yennefer’s teachings. This however, leads to the book's weakness. Where it makes up its world building, it lacks in plot development. Do not get me wrong there are some very key plot points that come up throughout the story, however there are moments where it seems that Sapkowski gets lost in building the world he forgets about the plot. This being the weakest book for me by no means makes this a terrible book. This is still a fantastic story and even when Sapkowski is lacking in my eyes he is still a world class writer.\n\nTime of Contempt: (4/5) “Time of Contempt” may be the most controversial book in the series. Both due to people saying that it is unbearably slow, and due to events that involve Ciri (the desert, the rats, etc.). I believe the problem with the pacing of this book is entirely because of “Blood of Elves.” That book reads so ungodly fast and “Time of Contempt” does not, so in relation to its prequel it seems slower than it actually is. It also is the exact opposite of “Blood of Elves” in terms of content. “Time of Contempt” Shovels so much plot development, sometimes it may seem too much to handle, and it is lacking in world building. This is totally fine in my eyes because Sapkowski is just correcting from the previous book. This book is also quintessential to the series, it introduces us to the idea that this series is not only about Geralt, and that Ciri is just as much as a main character if not more. The desert sequence (much to the dismay of readers) may be the most important sequence in the whole saga. I will not go into too much detail so as to not spoil it, but it creates a fundamental shift in theme for the story, and it all revolves around Ciri. I don’t feel like people give this book enough of a chance and that is a real shame due to how important it is to the ending of Ciri’s story.\n\nBaptism of Fire: (4/5) This book is well done, it is nicely paced, and the characters it introduces are some of the best in the series. I honestly do not have much to say about “Baptism of Fire” other than it was good. Sapkowski doesn’t try anything daring in this book and it plays as the calm before the storm. This is widely considered to be the best book in the series and I can totally see why, it is very fulfilling. However, it is considered to be most like the videogames and for the life of me I cannot see why. “Baptism of Fire” does have some of the coolest moments in the series, one being the battle on the bridge, and the other being the titular baptism of fire. Solid book.\n\nThe Tower of Swallows: (5/5) Holy cow, when I tell you I could not put this book down, I MEAN I COULD NOT PUT THIS SHIT DOWN. It has one of the greatest openings inthe franchise, those first three chapters read like a thriller. Sapkowski expertly balances his two protagonists Ciri and Geralt as they simply try to survive. There are jaw dropping moments, shocking moments, awesome moments, and moments that will bring you to tears. This is hands down my favorite book of the series and was completely caught off guard with this. Geralt’s company is finally completed in this book and they are just an absolute joy to read. You can tell Sapkowski loved to write all their dialogue scenes, he just puts so much into their personalities it’s amazing. Then we get Ciri’s storyline which is, in my opinion, peak Witcher. She is strong, and her conviction is powerful. She is incredibly inspiring in this book as she fights her way through the darkest parts of the series. The world trys to break her and she simply says “no” I fucking love it. Also… fear the man they call Bonhart ;)\n\nThe Lady of the Lake: (4.5/5) What can I say about “The Lady of the Lake” other than it is a great way to bring the five-book saga to a close. The book opens with a total whirlwind of a surprise that totally shifted my perspective of the series. Then after recovering from my fictional whiplash it is off to the races with this book. If I could use one word to describe what happens in this story it would definitely be “war.” There are wonderfully heart wrenching character deaths, beautiful battle sequences, and moments that show civilian life during war that seem to be more suspenseful than the tragedies of armies clashing. The ending of the book neatly wraps up the series in a melancholy bow. The fate of our dear Witcher Geralt, his Sorceress wife Yennefer, and their ashen haired daughter Ciri, is something that I found to be oddly comforting. I almost wish this was the end of their story and that CDPR would have chosen a different Witcher to implement into their games.\n\nSeason of Storms: (4/5) This is a very fun book and a nice way to bring the book series as a whole to a close. After going through severe depression from the ending of “The Lady of the Lake.” It was nice to go back in time to follow Geralt and Dandelion's dysfunctional adventures. I was pleasantly surprised at the level of mystery that surrounded the conflict of the story, and was even more taken aback by the level of comedic moments. Sapkowski is at his most witty in this book, the dialogue is hilarious and the situations that he puts our protagonists in are silly in the best way possible. It reads almost like a nineties action comedy mystery movie, if it was set in a dark fantasy setting. People often ask if “Season of Storms” should be read at the end even though the events take place before the saga, and I must say that it one hundred percent should be placed at the end. I think you will understand once you pick it up for yourself.",

Everyone of them alone is very memorable and a good character on their own, but they truly shine in their interactions with each other. Regis especially always brings a smile to my face.\nAnother great one is the splinter group of the original fellowship of the Ring consisting of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. They play off each other extremely well and I enjoyed every scene with them.\n\nEdit: I forgot one that I shouldn't have. They didn't cross my mind because they aren't literature. I'm talking about the bloody Ubersreik Five from Vermintide 1&2. These guys have brought me uncountable amounts of joy with their interactions and personalities.",

        "body": "Ok... favorite book so far.\n\nPlease don't spoil me on the rest\n\nThe chapter with the conclave of the mages was phenomenal. Easily the best chapter in all the books so far. From beggining to end, the banquet was super fun to read, Codringer and Fenn were such good good damn characters it's a shame they're already dead, and there's been a lot of revelations about ciri's profecy. \n\nI read through so fast, I'm not even sure I got everything right lol. \n\nSo... in the conclave of the mages there was a coup. In one side, was Vilgerfortz and his allies, supposedly siding with Nilfgaard (supposedly because vilgerfortz disappeared, but I suspect it's because of the tower... If I'm right, don't tell me). And on the other side, there was Phillipa Eilhart, and the mages who served their kings. And the people who served only the conclave, were left in a battle royale deathmatch for survival. So it was basically Nilfgaard vs kingdoms of the north again, but fought with mages. Then Dijkstra was taking geralt to luxia, to interrogate him about Ciri, when he escaped to find Yeneffer.  \n\nDid I get everything right?\n\nAnd I, surprisingly, even enjoyed the slower chapters of Ciri surviving on her own in the frying pan. And we had a shit ton of story for Ciri too, she killed her first monster, AND her first man. Plus she's a wizard now apparently. \n\nBut there's one thing. I cannot believe they killed my boy Applegat just like that. For nothing. For free. He seemed such a good dude. God dammit, I'm still not over it. \n\nAnd Ciri gets... raped in the end?? By an elf?? Jesus. \n\nBut regardless, the book was very good. The next one is batism of fire right? Or tower of swallows?",

        "title": "[Spoilers: A Clash of Kings] My Thoughts so Far",
        "body": "\nSo I’m about half way through ACoK and I think now is as good a time as any to talk about my thoughts and predictions and whatnot. \n\nTo start off, AGoT was an absolutely phenomenal book. I wasn’t sure if I’d like such a low fantasy setting, but I enjoyed it thoroughly and found it very fast paced. \n\nI think one of the reasons I loved the first book was due to the POV changes every chapter. It really makes all these different journeys have a feeling of connection. And I think Martin did a brilliant job of interweaving all the different plot threads. There were very few instances when I wasn’t enjoying the story (mostly some of Catelyn’s chapters) but even that was a minuscule problem due to the fact that I was aware the next chapter would be someone else. It acted as a good incentive to keep reading if the next chapter was from the POV of a character I loved.\n\nI was very curious of Jon’s story throughout the first book. I was really impressed by the prologue, so it was very exciting to have one of the main characters (kind of) dealing with the whole situation of the Others. And his relationships with Ghost and Sam are great. His whole decision about leaving the Wall was interesting and I was convinced he would actually join up with Robb after his conversation with Aemon, since it seemed as if he was trying to tell Jon that he regretted letting his family crumble while he stood aside. But his return to the Wall and the Brothers’ plan to advance north was a great way to end his arc.\n\nNed. Poor Ned. I was truly shocked. I didn’t think it would happen. I was so invested in his journey and when he realised the truth about Cersei and Jaime, I really felt as if I was him as I connected the dots of why Jon Arryn had visited all of Robert’s bastards and the ancestral book he was reading. I really hope Joffrey gets his head cut off by Robb. Even for what he is doing to Sansa. I’ll get to that later though.\n\nDany. Woah. Such a compelling story to read about. Her life was horrible, but she rose above that and forged her own path. Her final chapter was a perfect ending for the first book and her dragons are just epic. The scene of that witch she met performing the spell in the tent while Dany was being attacked outside by Drogo’s Bloodriders was incredibly tenses. I was really scared for her child there. And Viserys was super annoying so I’m glad he died. Haha.\n\nI had more thoughts of Book 1 but I’ll lump them in with Book 2 for now.\n\nAs I was saying, I despise Joffrey. The scene when he ordered Sansa to be stripped and beaten was horrible. I really feel for Sansa now, as I originally didn’t like her for how she treated Arya. But she’s under so much stress that it’s hard to not feel sorry. I hope she gets out of King’s Landing but I’m not sure if she’ll make it. \n\nArya is one of my favourites. Shes so pure and I have a feeling that the list she’s after making will be slowly shortening for the next while if you get what I’m saying. I have confidence that she’ll figure some way out of Harrenhal and make her way around. I hope she gets to see Jon in the future as I thought they’re bond was very special. Also, theory time: the whole fiasco of Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen being bastards and Jon and Ned figuring it out by their hair colour… it makes me skeptical as to why Arya is the only Stark with dark hair like Jon Snow’s. And we know Jon is definitely Ned’s child (at least I think, purely because of the fact that he wouldn’t be around if Ned hadn’t fathered him). So I’m sure Arya is also Ned’s. As for Robb, Sansa, Bran and Rickon… if Catelyn was up to no good, she’s not doing herself a favour on the list of characters I like. \n\nAnyways, Bran is very cool. I liked him from the start and he has only improved since. His maturity is admirable and his desire to be a knight but knowing he can’t he is heart breaking. The whole three-eyed crow is interesting. I’m wondering if he will have a story similar to that of Yennefer from the Witcher (basically she’s a deformed nobody who learns magic to fix her appearance to rise high in society). Bran seems to have a strong interest in the children of the forest, so maybe they could still be around, or maybe the crow will help him open his third eye and he’ll be able to gain magical abilities that fix his legs and he won’t be a cripple anymore. I also love his friendship with Osha, Meera and Jojen. \n\nCatelyn is definitely… a character. Sometimes I love her, other times I can’t stand her. The strongest memory of her I have is when she screams at Jon when he visits Bran in his coma before he leaves, and that left a bad taste in my mouth regarding her. Her sister is awful though. Arrogant, over protective and stupid. At least Catelyn is wise-ish. I’m not too sure what to make of her relationship with Robb. I like Robb, and I think Catelyn cares for him deeply. I want to see more of him though. Now, I’m starting to take interest in her story after Renly was slaughtered by that shadow (which was definitely Melisandre, she’s wicked… but I think I respect her) and I’m looking forward to see where she goes with Brienne. \n\nTyrion was someone who I didn’t like for that beginning of the first book, but after a while I started to love him. Every chapter of his has me laughing, especially when he’s talking to Cersei or Joffrey. His friendship with Varys is excellent and I hope I’ll learn more about Varys in the future. He’s such a rich character with so much potential. Definitely intriguing. And I don’t mind him taking over King’s Landing with his men. He’s all good in my eyes. I hope he sticks around for another while.\n\nTheon… good ol’ Theon. Very… assertive. Besides when he’s with his father. Then he’s diminished. I’m not sure what to think of him. Especially that bit with his sister… that was questionable on her part. I want him to betray his father and help defend Winterfell when the time comes, but that has a low chance of happening I think. I’ll have to see more of him before I can properly judge him.\n\nNow Jon has just discovered a black cloak buried under the ground with a load of ancient knives, and being honest I have no clue what that could be implying so I’m going to have to read his next chapter to see. I hope he encounters the Others at some point. Not that I want him to die, that would be bad, but if he could just see them with his own eyes I think that would be good. \n\nDany is currently in Qarth and everyone loves her, so I couldn’t ask for much more. I am eagerly waiting for these dragons to get really big so she can start conquering. If she comes to Westeros… I don’t know who’s side I’ll be on.\n\nOh and the prologue for the second book was really cool as well. The comet is great for seeing everyone think it’s special to them specifically. And that fool Cressen met who disappeared for three days at sea and returned in that odd state of mind… he creeped me out. And Melisandre was there, all red and powerful. I feel bad for Cressen though. I like him for the 10 pages he got.\n\nSo I have about 400 pages left and I’m excited to see where this all leads. Some predictions just for fun:\n-Mance Rayder is going to turn out nothing like what the Brothers suspect, and they’ll end up working together against the Others. \n-Cersei is going to flee King’s Landing and embark on a quest to free Jaime after Stannis sieges the city. \n-Robb will grow into a huge force and move south only to find out the Greyjoys are attacking Winterfell, but it’s too late and he can’t turn back. \n-Winterfell will get absolutely destroyed and Bran will run (or crawl or be carried) away with Osha, Meera, Jojen and Hodor. Also Meera might die or sacrifice herself to save them. \n-Dany will gather loads of people to her Khalasar and use her dragons to attack east and take over more areas. I think Jorah is going to die protecting her though.\n-Tyrion will defeat Stannis with all his men and take over King’s Landing for a bit. \n-Tywin will be slain by Robb and his direwolf and as a result Joffrey is going to nearly kill Sansa but end up being killed by the Hound or that knight that Sansa has been meeting with.\n-Jon will become the commander of the Wall.\n-Arya will kill all of those people and then go through the whole ‘revenge isn’t worth it’ phase and do some redeeming.\n-Littlefinger will try to have Tyrion murdered or plan to do something big.\n-Catelyn will die (a man can dream)\n\nThat’s pretty much it. Definitely looking forward to the rest of the series. Sorry if this was a little long. Please don’t spoil anything for me, the last chapter I read was Jojen telling Bran about his dream about the sea coming to Winterfell and Bran and Rickon being skinned by that bandit they caught connected with the Boltons or something. I might do another update when I finish this book. I’ll see how it is. Definitely will make an appreciation post dedicated to George if he kills Catelyn off, so look out for that.\n\nAlso, for some reason I can’t post this in r/asoiaf. It gets deleted immediately every time I try. Does anybody know why that would be a problem?",

Might watch the later episodes next time, especially the last one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tisseia never fails in expressing the amount of poise, power, and position she has. This stare and posture says it all about her indifference to Yen. Makes me think how many girls she'd taught who'd started out like this.](https://preview.redd.it/jjjzbaogf2r71.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=12cfb1792d03b21d3af3ebc60cff3f474b9487ba)\n\nI also started feeling the edibles kick in here and really felt like I was in the tower of the gull whenever the camera started moving. At some times, I thought I was just observing the scene unfold. At other times, I felt like I was experiencing the character's emotions in real time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[THIS PORTAL FORMING AND SWRLING WAS PHENOMINAL. It was like reality was bending at that space.](https://preview.redd.it/nygvccd3q2r71.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9428b4beb6727d41cf473e6b83d9911dc17feb4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Just realized that snot came out of her during her ugly cry. ](https://preview.redd.it/hsge3h7cg2r71.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab2eda265145a2267b5800111c014f02ed169739)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DUDE THIS TRANSITION WAS FUCKING AMAZING WITH YEN'S THEME.

But when she loses control, I could FEEL the loss of control in her chaos.

Definitely the highlight of this episode for me. The thoughts of the girls kept moving back and forth, except for Yennefer.

Yen's scream when she lets that lighting free really just echoes at how empty Tor Lara is at night. Also had a big revelation to the \\\\\"four marks\\\\\" thing from seeing two slashes on each of Yen's wrists.](https://preview.redd.it/dao6lsmqm2r71.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cf2ca1d3d1d8d54917f0ac23d19b40d2d7fd83a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Oh boy the eels scene.

It had two sides of it: one being her relief for not letting Yen ascend and the other her worry of what her future would be after.](https://preview.redd.it/ql4y580po2r71.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=61998929244b7212f3e10d2667f2c7ed8d050132)",

        "body": "Ok, so to preface: I have read all of the books twice, played the first two games twice, and the third game four times. I only just watched the show because I heard it was very different from the books so I had my reservations, but, I'm procrastinating uni work so I had nothing better to do. \n\nSome things I liked:\n\n* MyAnna Buring did an amazing job as Tissaia de Vries and is exactly how I imagined her when reading the books. Definitely my favourite character and casting choice in the series. \n* Although I do prefer game Geralt and Doug Cockle's voice acting, Henry did a great job and I'm looking forward to seeing what else he does with Geralt.\n* Freya Allan was the perfect casting for Ciri IMO (potentially unpopular opinion?).\n* Adam Levy was a great Mousesack. \n* Jaskier is funny and I don't hate how the writers chose his original name. \n* Vilgefortz seems interesting so far (although potentially not powerful enough).\n* Roach. \n\nSome things I disliked:\n\n* Fringilla. Why was she a villain? Why did she go to Aretuza with Yennefer?\n* Cahir. He seems too evil compared to book Cahir so far.\n* The Dryads of Brokilon. \n* What's with the elves' ears? Why do they stick out so much? Why are they acting as though they've never done anything wrong?\n* Eyck of Denesle was done really dirty - didn't particularly like him in the books but he still deserved better. \n* I understand why they included Yennefer's backstory, but I feel like she should be a more mysterious character. She was also far too powerful at the Battle of Sodden Hill.\n* Where is the relationship between Geralt and Ciri? They meet once at the end and it feels like it doesn't really mean much if you have no prior knowledge of the Witcher universe. \n* Edit: Foltest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\nDisclaimer: These are obviously just my opinions. I didn't mention casting **issues** because it is too controversial and polarising. There will also be things that I forgot about but will add them later if ai remember.",

        "body": "Netflix has the Witcher (season 2) coming out. Amazon has Wheel of Time coming this November and Lord of the Rings afterwards. HBO max has House of the Dragon (a game of thrones spin-off). \n\nI think in the long-run only one will dominate, the others will fade away. From what we have seen the production value for House of the Dragon looks the best (with the best looking cast as well): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNwwt25mheo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNwwt25mheo)  \n\nHighlight actor/actress: For me it is Olivia Cooke but Matt Smith is more famous. \n\nThe Wheel of Time, despite its high budget, looks like it has low production value for some reason: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fus4Xb\\_TLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fus4Xb_TLg) \n\nThey have more source material so can last longer than HotD. The Game of Thrones spin off looks to be more action packed and less story focused. Lots more CGI battles and less plotting. Wheel of Time has a fourteen book series to dig into, with a lot of room for improvement. \n\nHighlight actress: Rosamund Pike who plays the lead character in the first season, Moraine. I think besides her the actors are less well known/less experienced, so it might be risky. They are leaning on Pike to do most of the heavy lifting. I would be excited, but again something seems off about the lighting and camera work. This scene for example looks pretty choppy. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fus4Xb\\_TLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fus4Xb_TLg) \n\nThen we have the Witcher season 2. Freya Allan is coming back as Ciri and looks like she and Henry Cavill will play the lead roles together. The first season was okay, but it was very narrow. It didn't feel like an expansive show, and the sets felt small for some reason. The second season looks to try it expand it to make the show into a break-out multi-billion dollar fantasy series. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aMVzFlApa0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aMVzFlApa0) \n\nThe story is also more connected now that the first book is out of the way. But we should also look at statistics. This teaser came out 2 months ago and has 8 million views on Youtube. \n\nThe Wheel of Time teaser trailer came out 1 month ago and has 10 million views. \n\nThe HotD teaser came out four days ago and has 10 million views. \n\nSo the Witcher is way behind while the Game of Thrones spin off is way ahead. BUT, Netflix has more subscribers than Amazon prime video or HBO+. The latter two are investing big to grow their base, while Disney has Marvel and Star Wars. \n\nSo Netflix has less to lose and less to gain. The real investment is coming from HBO and Amazon. \n\nThe second series by Amazon is LotR but not much is known of that besides the fact that Morfyyd Clarke will be their main lead and it has a high per episode cost than either of the other shows. \n\nSo which do you think will win?",

        "body": "*I've just finished my 2021 Bingo Card, and will post mini-reviews for each of the rows in separate posts. I can't promise that the reviews are spoiler-free, hence the tag.*\n\n*As well as the mini-reviews, I have provided a rating out of five, for each book. A 5/5 represents a book that I think is exceptional, and would happily keep on my bookshelf. A 4/5 represents a book I think is very good, that I would buy, but probably ultimately wouldn't keep. A 3/5 represents a book that is okay; I wouldn't buy it, but I would perhaps borrow it to read. A 2/5 I would not recommend reading. A 1/5 is a truly ghastly book that is a waste of organic material.*\n\n*Of the 25 books read for this Bingo Card, I rated 5 books 5/5, 4 books 4/5, 11 books 3/5, and 5 books 2/5.*\n\n*Now, on with the reviews!*\n\n**Row 5 Books:**\n\n* X of Y - **A Clash of Kings** by George RR Martin\n* First Contact - **The Sparrow** by Mary Doria Russell\n* Trans or Nonbinary Character - **Black Sun** by Rebecca Roanhorse\n* Debut - **The Darkness That Comes Before** by R Scott Bakker\n* Witches - **Time of Contempt** by Andrzej Sapkowski\n\n**X of Y**\n\n**A Clash of Kings** by George RR Martin\n\nWhat to say about the A Song of Ice and Fire novels that hasn't already been said? What struck me the most about A Clash of Kings was how it stepped up the grim dirtiness and violence of the world that Martin has so painstakingly crafted, even from the first novel. As shocking as the HBO adaptation can be at times, it really is a sanitised take on the books. I came to A Clash of Kings wanting a literary fix after playing FromSoftware's Dark Souls, and was pleasantly surprised to see a similar Berserk influence, most presciently in a scene that involved Gregor Clegane and his men falling on an inn. This scene is a version of that seen in Berserk, but with the stipulation that there is no Guts to correct the situation. What follows is one of the most harrowing scenes in the book, and indeed, there are a great many injustices and violations littered this part of Westeros' Sengoku Jidai. As always, the Hound says it best.\n\nRating: 4/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** *The Hound:* There are no true knights, no more than there are gods. If you can't protect yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world, don't ever believe any different. I'm honest. It's the world that's awful.\n\n**First Contact**\n\n**The Sparrow** by Mary Doria Russell\n\nAs much as the plot of The Sparrow has been summarised by many as what happens when good intentions - via misunderstanding - lead to disaster, it is a summary that I don't altogether agree with. That is to say, it’s a gross softening of the real culprit: Wilful ignorance. My view of The Sparrow is a bifurcated one: On the one hand, the prose is gorgeous, the themes weighty and expertly handled. On the other, I feel that the plot is somewhat contrived; that the author wanted to tell a particular story, an imagining of a modern Jesuit mission between intelligent species, and insodoing made choices that are hard to reconcile. These choices often come down to the crew of the Stella Maris - who travel to investigate a planet where songs have been received by the Arecibo telescope - giddily joining in with Emilio Sandoz's (a priest) plans of action because 'he has felt God', with little recourse to caution. When disaster strikes, it's altogether apparent that this could have been avoided. If the book was about First Contact Gone Wrong, then this would barely be a book worth reading. But it's not. It's a book about faith, and about faith being relentlessly tested. Make no mistake, religion runs rife throughout the book, it being the primary driving force. If you want a realistic account of a first contact, this isn't it (no-one thought to do recon from orbit prior to closer examination of the indigineous species and their social structures - one of which being carnivore, which should set alarm bells ringing very loudly - prior to initiating contact). But if you want an interesting account of a world that is a speculative parallel to the earlier Jesuit missions this world has seen, this is very much that. A book that I didn't love, but will stick with me for the haunting events told within it, and the exceptional writing.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** *Anne:* Jimmy, I honestly don't know if the world would be better or worse if we all held ourselves to the vows of our youth.\n\n**Trans or Nonbinary Character**\n\n**Black Sun** by Rebecca Roanhorse\n\nIn the acknowledgements of this, the first book in her Between Earth and Sky series, Roanhorse cites the fact that a lot of fantasy looks to the workings of medieval Europe for inspiration, as impetus for her exploring her heritage and building a world influenced instead by Pre-Columbian civilizations. It is as refreshing to step into this world as it was that of the recent 'A Memory Called Empire' by Arkady Martine, which melded Byzantine inclinations with the rather more under-represented Aztec civilizations. Here, we have blood magic, divination, tribes, and affinities for certain animals, as well as a third gender that is neither him nor her. There are a couple of characters that we encounter that are referred to as xir or xe - whether this has basis in the history of these cultures or is a modernisation, I don't know. However, I look forward to seeing literature - and really, the English language, as well as others - embrace gender neutral pronouns. For Sci-Fi, I feel it's somewhat short-sighted to not have gender neutral pronouns. It's already happening! Why wouldn't this be a permanent adjustment to the English in, oh, 100 years? Less than? But I digress. While I enjoyed the book, and may pick up the follow-up, it didn't quite hit all the right notes for me. I had very little attachment to the characters and the motive of revenge was never adequately explained. Perhaps it will be in the second book, but I see it as something of a failing that you can never really get behind Serapio's path to vengeance. It's not a large book as is, so perhaps room could've been made?\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** His hair was tousled from her hands, his lips slightly swollen from being pressed against hers. Definitely a man but perhaps a bit of a monster, too? The same could be said of her. And did it matter at all, these labels and categories, when it was just the two of them here, together?\n\n**Debut**\n\n**The Darkness That Comes Before** by R Scott Bakker\n\nThe Darkness That Comes Before is an interesting proposition, and perhaps I admire its proposition more than its execution. There is an emptiness to the novel, a black chasm wherein Nietzschean philosophy has removed all emotion. The novel creates an atmosphere that has been likened to that of Dark Souls and Berserk, and while I believe there are just parallels between these works, TDTCB is philosophical at heart. The book opens with a quote by Nietzsche: \"...a thought comes when 'it' wants, not when 'I' want\", and this is at the heart of the Dunyain, the monastic sect (whose motivations are surely philosophical rather than religious) who (arguably) the main character Anasurimbor Kellhus belongs to. The Dunyain, over thousands of years, have bred for logic in favour of passion, as they seek the Absolute - the mastering of this idea by Nietzsche, whereby thoughts will come not unbidden, but through purposeful selection by the thinker. As such, Kellhus is decidely post-human. He sees humans, ruled as they are by their passions, as a simple collection of muscles and bones. The Darkness that Comes Before entirely dictates that which comes after, and so the Dunyain can easily manipulate humans on a massive scale. We see glimpses of Kellhus' manipulations throughout the book, but really TDTCB is just the prologue, the assembling of the Holy War and hints to a greater evil at work (the re-summoning of the No-God by the Consult to lay utter devastation to what could be called civilization). This is the promise for the subsequent books in the series, and though I am looking forward to the continuation of this tale, I feel that there is a lot of fat in TDTCB. We are constantly told by various characters how unnerved they are by Kellhus (aren't we already unnerved by his dispassionate assessment of human beings?), and there are stretches of the book for which nothing really happens (both in terms of action and in terms of ideas being explored). If this was two-thirds the size, it would probably get four stars. As it is, the book unfortunately drags on.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** *Conphas:* Alas, Martemus, if I were to tell you all I know, you'd still suffer the same deficit. Answers are like opium: the more you imbibe, the more you need. Which is why the sober man finds solace in mystery.\n\n**Witches**\n\n**Time of Contempt** by Andrzej Sapkowski\n\nIt was all going so well. After the disappointing first entry proper in the Witcher series of novels, Blood of Elves, I wanted to give Andrzej Sapkowski's modern classic another run, principally because I had just finished my second playthrough of CD Projekt Red's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and was enthralled by the mythology and lore of The Witcher universe. It would be all too easy to judge The Witcher books alongside the Witcher games, but that would be unfair. Different media, different beasts and - ultimately - different stories. So putting everything I know of the games aside, and approaching this as an original (the original) telling, the first half of Time of Contempt was everything I that I could have hoped for. Political intrigue, the introduction of notable characters and smooth switching between them; this is the first entry that felt like a dynamic world. Sure, the writing is very blunt - often heavy-handed - and I'm fairly sure I've heard the words 'Time of Contempt' spoken by a number of characters up to this point. But into the second half of the book, all the flaws become somewhat more magnified. Ciri's meanderings through the desert, while hardly captivating, are still something of import to the overarching narrative. What is not, and what I see as unforgivable, is the handling of the character. There is a lot of talk of rape in this book. It's a constant shadow. Ciri does not escape the shadow. She is almost raped by a man. A woman defends her. Said woman then rapes her. And all the while, Sapkowski passes it off as okay because 'she finds comfort in it'. No. Ciri is a girl, underage, having escaped the sacking of her city and death of her grandmother, the only person left caring for her. She is taken in by Yennefer and Geralt, but utlimately she is left to fend for herself. She is left to fend for herself. She is abandoned. So when someone tries to rape her, and a woman then wants to comfort her, what exactly is she to do? And as for the woman, is this really the time to engage in sexual discourse with someone? Right after she's almost been raped? It is a terrible treatment of the character that is supposed to be the heart of the book. Yennefer is imperious, Geralt is distantly pragmatic. There's just nothing here to cling to. Through this book, I realise that the universe that Andrzej Sapkowski is very interesting. He's just not very good at telling it through the characters he's invented. If you do want an exceptionally interesting and well-handled plot filled with monsters, political intrigue magic and (oddly enough) a bit of Sci-Fi, CD Projekt Red's The Witcher 3 would be your best bet. Sapkowski's greatest contribution to literature is that he inspired a narrative that transcends his own.\n\nRating: 2/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** *Geralt*: Paupers with difficulties can't afford your services. *Codringher*: Paupers can't afford your services either. Paupers can never afford anything, which is precisely why they're called paupers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMain Takeaways: Give up on The Witcher (or, at least, don't hold any hope for it getting better), continue ASOIAF when the moment takes me.\n\nThat's it, that's all of the rows reviewed. See you next year!",

It's a book about faith, and about faith being relentlessly tested. Make no mistake, religion runs rife throughout the book, it being the primary driving force. If you want a realistic account of a first contact, this isn't it (no-one thought to do recon from orbit prior to closer examination of the indigineous species and their social structures - one of which being carnivore, which should set alarm bells ringing very loudly - prior to initiating contact). But if you want an interesting account of a world that is a speculative parallel to the earlier Jesuit missions this world has seen, this is very much that. A book that I didn't love, but will stick with me for the haunting events told within it, and the exceptional writing.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** *Anne:* Jimmy, I honestly don't know if the world would be better or worse if we all held ourselves to the vows of our youth.\n\n**Trans or Nonbinary Character**\n\n**Black Sun** by Rebecca Roanhorse\n\nIn the acknowledgements of this, the first book in her Between Earth and Sky series, Roanhorse cites the fact that a lot of fantasy looks to the workings of medieval Europe for inspiration, as impetus for her exploring her heritage and building a world influenced instead by Pre-Columbian civilizations. It is as refreshing to step into this world as it was that of the recent 'A Memory Called Empire' by Arkady Martine, which melded Byzantine inclinations with the rather more under-represented Aztec civilizations. Here, we have blood magic, divination, tribes, and affinities for certain animals, as well as a third gender that is neither him nor her. There are a couple of characters that we encounter that are referred to as xir or xe - whether this has basis in the history of these cultures or is a modernisation, I don't know. However, I look forward to seeing literature - and really, the English language, as well as others - embrace gender neutral pronouns. For Sci-Fi, I feel it's somewhat short-sighted to not have gender neutral pronouns. It's already happening! Why wouldn't this be a permanent adjustment to the English in, oh, 100 years? Less than? But I digress. While I enjoyed the book, and may pick up the follow-up, it didn't quite hit all the right notes for me. I had very little attachment to the characters and the motive of revenge was never adequately explained. Perhaps it will be in the second book, but I see it as something of a failing that you can never really get behind Serapio's path to vengeance. It's not a large book as is, so perhaps room could've been made?\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** His hair was tousled from her hands, his lips slightly swollen from being pressed against hers. Definitely a man but perhaps a bit of a monster, too? The same could be said of her. And did it matter at all, these labels and categories, when it was just the two of them here, together?\n\n**Debut**\n\n**The Darkness That Comes Before** by R Scott Bakker\n\nThe Darkness That Comes Before is an interesting proposition, and perhaps I admire its proposition more than its execution. There is an emptiness to the novel, a black chasm wherein Nietzschean philosophy has removed all emotion. The novel creates an atmosphere that has been likened to that of Dark Souls and Berserk, and while I believe there are just parallels between these works, TDTCB is philosophical at heart. The book opens with a quote by Nietzsche: \"...a thought comes when 'it' wants, not when 'I' want\", and this is at the heart of the Dunyain, the monastic sect (whose motivations are surely philosophical rather than religious) who (arguably) the main character Anasurimbor Kellhus belongs to. The Dunyain, over thousands of years, have bred for logic in favour of passion, as they seek the Absolute - the mastering of this idea by Nietzsche, whereby thoughts will come not unbidden, but through purposeful selection by the thinker. As such, Kellhus is decidely post-human. He sees humans, ruled as they are by their passions, as a simple collection of muscles and bones. The Darkness that Comes Before entirely dictates that which comes after, and so the Dunyain can easily manipulate humans on a massive scale. We see glimpses of Kellhus' manipulations throughout the book, but really TDTCB is just the prologue, the assembling of the Holy War and hints to a greater evil at work (the re-summoning of the No-God by the Consult to lay utter devastation to what could be called civilization). This is the promise for the subsequent books in the series, and though I am looking forward to the continuation of this tale, I feel that there is a lot of fat in TDTCB. We are constantly told by various characters how unnerved they are by Kellhus (aren't we already unnerved by his dispassionate assessment of human beings?), and there are stretches of the book for which nothing really happens (both in terms of action and in terms of ideas being explored). If this was two-thirds the size, it would probably get four stars. As it is, the book unfortunately drags on.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** *Conphas:* Alas, Martemus, if I were to tell you all I know, you'd still suffer the same deficit. Answers are like opium: the more you imbibe, the more you need. Which is why the sober man finds solace in mystery.\n\n**Witches**\n\n**Time of Contempt** by Andrzej Sapkowski\n\nIt was all going so well. After the disappointing first entry proper in the Witcher series of novels, Blood of Elves, I wanted to give Andrzej Sapkowski's modern classic another run, principally because I had just finished my second playthrough of CD Projekt Red's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and was enthralled by the mythology and lore of The Witcher universe. It would be all too easy to judge The Witcher books alongside the Witcher games, but that would be unfair. Different media, different beasts and - ultimately - different stories. So putting everything I know of the games aside, and approaching this as an original (the original) telling, the first half of Time of Contempt was everything I that I could have hoped for. Political intrigue, the introduction of notable characters and smooth switching between them; this is the first entry that felt like a dynamic world. Sure, the writing is very blunt - often heavy-handed - and I'm fairly sure I've heard the words 'Time of Contempt' spoken by a number of characters up to this point. But into the second half of the book, all the flaws become somewhat more magnified. Ciri's meanderings through the desert, while hardly captivating, are still something of import to the overarching narrative. What is not, and what I see as unforgivable, is the handling of the character. There is a lot of talk of rape in this book. It's a constant shadow. Ciri does not escape the shadow. She is almost raped by a man. A woman defends her. Said woman then rapes her. And all the while, Sapkowski passes it off as okay because 'she finds comfort in it'. No. Ciri is a girl, underage, having escaped the sacking of her city and death of her grandmother, the only person left caring for her. She is taken in by Yennefer and Geralt, but utlimately she is left to fend for herself. She is left to fend for herself. She is abandoned. So when someone tries to rape her, and a woman then wants to comfort her, what exactly is she to do? And as for the woman, is this really the time to engage in sexual discourse with someone? Right after she's almost been raped? It is a terrible treatment of the character that is supposed to be the heart of the book. Yennefer is imperious, Geralt is distantly pragmatic. There's just nothing here to cling to. Through this book, I realise that the universe that Andrzej Sapkowski is very interesting. He's just not very good at telling it through the characters he's invented. If you do want an exceptionally interesting and well-handled plot filled with monsters, political intrigue magic and (oddly enough) a bit of Sci-Fi, CD Projekt Red's The Witcher 3 would be your best bet. Sapkowski's greatest contribution to literature is that he inspired a narrative that transcends his own.\n\nRating: 2/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** *Geralt*: Paupers with difficulties can't afford your services. *Codringher*: Paupers can't afford your services either. Paupers can never afford anything, which is precisely why they're called paupers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMain Takeaways: Give up on The Witcher (or, at least, don't hold any hope for it getting better), continue ASOIAF when the moment takes me.\n\nThat's it, that's all of the rows reviewed.

        "body": "*I've just finished my 2021 Bingo Card, and will post mini-reviews for each of the rows in separate posts. I can't promise that the reviews are spoiler-free, hence the tag.*\n\n*As well as the mini-reviews, I have provided a rating out of five, for each book. A 5/5 represents a book that I think is exceptional, and would happily keep on my bookshelf. A 4/5 represents a book I think is very good, that I would buy, but probably ultimately wouldn't keep. A 3/5 represents a book that is okay; I wouldn't buy it, but I would perhaps borrow it to read. A 2/5 I would not recommend reading. A 1/5 is a truly ghastly book that is a waste of organic material.*\n\n*Of the 25 books read for this Bingo Card, I rated 5 books 5/5, 4 books 4/5, 11 books 3/5, and 5 books 2/5.*\n\n*Now, on with the reviews!*\n\n**Row 5 Books:**\n\n* X of Y - **A Clash of Kings** by George RR Martin\n* First Contact - **The Sparrow** by Mary Doria Russell\n* Trans or Nonbinary Character - **Black Sun** by Rebecca Roanhorse\n* Debut - **The Darkness That Comes Before** by R Scott Bakker\n* Witches - **Time of Contempt** by Andrzej Sapkowski\n\n**X of Y**\n\n**A Clash of Kings** by George RR Martin\n\nWhat to say about the A Song of Ice and Fire novels that hasn't already been said? What struck me the most about A Clash of Kings was how it stepped up the grim dirtiness and violence of the world that Martin has so painstakingly crafted, even from the first novel. As shocking as the HBO adaptation can be at times, it really is a sanitised take on the books. I came to A Clash of Kings wanting a literary fix after playing FromSoftware's Dark Souls, and was pleasantly surprised to see a similar Berserk influence, most presciently in a scene that involved Gregor Clegane and his men falling on an inn. This scene is a version of that seen in Berserk, but with the stipulation that there is no Guts to correct the situation. What follows is one of the most harrowing scenes in the book, and indeed, there are a great many injustices and violations littered this part of Westeros' Sengoku Jidai. As always, the Hound says it best.\n\nRating: 4/5\n\n**Choice Quote:** *The Hound:* There are no true knights, no more than there are gods. If you can't protect yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world, don't ever believe any different. I'm honest. It's the world that's awful.\n\n**First Contact**\n\n**The Sparrow** by Mary Doria Russell\n\nAs much as the plot of The Sparrow has been summarised by many as what happens when good intentions - via misunderstanding - lead to disaster, it is a summary that I don't altogether agree with. That is to say, it’s a gross softening of the real culprit: Wilful ignorance. My view of The Sparrow is a bifurcated one: On the one hand, the prose is gorgeous, the themes weighty and expertly handled. On the other, I feel that the plot is somewhat contrived; that the author wanted to tell a particular story, an imagining of a modern Jesuit mission between intelligent species, and insodoing made choices that are hard to reconcile. These choices often come down to the crew of the Stella Maris - who travel to investigate a planet where songs have been received by the Arecibo telescope - giddily joining in with Emilio Sandoz's (a priest) plans of action because 'he has felt God', with little recourse to caution. When disaster strikes, it's altogether apparent that this could have been avoided. If the book was about First Contact Gone Wrong, then this would barely be a book worth reading. But it's not.

In the books, virtually nothing is known about her aftermath of Sodden, except that she was blind and healed at Thanedd in the meantime. She was also keeping herself hidden from magic iirc, as Vilgefortz mentioned to Tissaia that he couldn’t track her down.  Aside from that, not much is there to go on.\n\nThis is probably a rough and only 50% correct narrative of what's going to be happening with her, as unlike Ciri and Geralt, she really doesn't have as much \"screentime\" in the books. \n\n* **Episode 1** \\- from the recent reviews, we know she's present, but not much; my guess is, the entire episode is spent with her being a captive of the Nilfgaardians' and Fringilla's until the very end of the episode, when both of them end up captured by the elves\n* **Episode 2** \\- same as in episode 1; apparently, she's not that present either; I originally thought that this episode will handle Yennefer and Fringilla's interactions with Francesca (including the infamous Baba Yaga house scene) but if she's not involved in the episode a lot, then that probably means the elves' storyline isn't resolved until the end of the episode and could very well continue into E03.\n* **Episode 3** \\- this is where I'm not so sure anymore - I would say that Yennefer's captivity with the elves comes to an end here and she's given back to the northern Brotherhood of sorcerers at the large meeting that was leaked of those ruins - Cahir is also present in a rather chaotic state so it could be that he was captured by the Northerners and this is an exchange of hostages\n* **Episode 4** \\- Yennefer is possibly interrogated here in those scenes with Stregobor that we saw in the trailer; the scene with Tissaia also seems very likely to happen in this one - this is also probably the episode where she, if the books are followed, joins the Brotherhood as a member of the council, due to her heroic act back at Sodden Hill - whatever the case, I do feel that towards the end of this episode, Yennefer meets up >!with Jaskier and saves him from Rience!<. Her words from the trailer >!\"man, myth, legend\"!< may be something she says to him when she finds him.\n* **Episode 5** \\- I honestly have no clue what  she could be doing in this one. Probably a continuation of E04 with>! Jaskier !<or some completely original content involving Istredd or the Nilfgaardians, through Fringilla - there were those leaks about Yennefer possibly >!betraying Geralt and Ciri !<so this episode might be where she makes the deal to do that.\n* **Episode 6** \\- the Dear Friend episode. My guess is, it's probably a continuation of E05's original content before she then receives Geralt's letter in regards to Ciri - this may happen just before she makes her deal with the Nilfgaardians, if that is indeed the case - the episode ends with Geralt receiving her infamous letter in return.\n* **Episode 7** \\- this one seems to be with the demoness, Voleth Meir - this is probably where >!Ciri and Yennefer spend!< time together at Ellander before >!she lures them into a trap!<; but then again, Geralt also seems like he's>! fighting the Michelet brothers!< at that same temple\n* Episode 8 - honestly, who knows about this one. If she does >!betray Geralt and Ciri but then quickly regrets it!<, this could go in all sorts of directions. My guess is that they still end the season together, as a \"fractured\" family. \n\nI just don't know how much bonding time we'll get for Yennefer and Ciri if the betrayal also does happen, which I'm still hoping is just a misunderstanding on our side. And then there's also all the other elements in S2 that are a bit harder to sort anywhere - we know Istredd is there and somehow I can't imagine him appearing without interacting with Yennefer - they are apparently adapting some condensed version of a Shard of Ice at one point or the other. Then there's the Voleth Meir element as well which seems to play a big part in Yennefer's storyline and her wish to find a family/happiness.\n\nFurthermore, it seems Francesca will be appearing in 7 out of 8 episodes if those leaks are true so she may be interacting with Yennefer as well at later points in the story (my theory is that the Baba Yaga house scene is Francesca showing Yennefer how she met Voleth Meir with whom she then made a deal to be able to get pregnant, which is why Yennefer herself reaches out to this demoness later on for that same deal).\n\nThe first few episodes are relatively easy to guess but as one goes further into the story, it's harder to figure out what's up with Yenn - and it's been too long since I've read the books so if I missed anything, feel free to correct me.

Now I went the king of beggars way, feeling more at home story wise, because I imagine like most players, I didn't play w1 and w2. And supposedly killing Radovid and putting Dikstra on his place is the only way to destroy the eternal fire people. Almost got Triss tortured too. Starting now, can't wait to finish it. Already did the Hattori quest. It's surprisingly doable at level 12, if you dodge like a madman, that is.   \n\n\nAny thoughts welcome.",

        "body": "IMO they cast her a bit young, or perhaps wrote her to act too young. I understand with the backstory aspect that they needed someone a bit more youthful, but she always seems to come across like a moody teen. Yennefer to me was much more mature when I played the games, more level headed and calculating as opposed to angry and tormented. She was a powerful sorceress because of decades of disciplined training, not because she had strong emotions. I think she’s also supposed to be around 70 when she meets Geralt for the first time but her maturity level doesn’t even flinch between the 30 year flash forward she had. I also thought her entire motivation being “I actually do want a baby” was pretty out of character but that’s a fairly minor issue for me. The director also /really/ liked having her topless, which I’m not necessarily complaining about, but it did feel needless at times and like it was just thrown in to give the viewers some eye candy. \n\nNot at all dissing the actor, I think she did a very good job portraying Yennefer’s emotions and her pre-transition performance was amazing, I just wish the writers had taken a different direction with her character.\n\nEDIT: I guess it is a bit unfair of me to compare the show to the game when it is based off of the books so take this with a grain of salt. I hope they really give her a fully fleshed character arch, as they seem to be doing, because I’m so excited to see her relationship with Ciri in the later seasons.",

        "body": "Welcome to the third part of our [Curse of the Mistwraith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28660.The_Curse_of_the_Mistwraith?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=TA9Uk6X9v9&rank=1) read-along. Today we'll be diving into **Chapters 5 and 6**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's begin our discussion by talking a bit about the brothers.\n\nWhat do you think about their way of coping with their new status in this new world.\n\nAnd how about the world itself, the clansmen and  town’s people?\n\nThe encounter in between Arithon and Elaira. How did you find that?\n\nDid the  **Iyats** ,  Khadrim,  or  **Meth-snakes** catch your attention? Which ones do you find more intriguing?\n\nDakar screws up again - dead drunk and snoring in a gutter, sprawled on his back and covered with garbage - yuck! Laugh at him, slap him, turn away in disgust - or quite possibly all three together would have been my choice. How about you?\n\nAnd let us not forget Alithiel? What do you think about it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***In case any of you would like to discuss the finer points:***\n\nHow do you find Lysaer's envy and desire for Alithiel?\n\nAnd after that insight into their **hopes and expectations,** did your opinion on them change or has it been reinforced?\n\nWhy do you think  **music and those who bring it are highly valued on Athera?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny questions? Or perhaps other points you'd like us to discuss?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DETAILED CHAPTER SUMMARIES**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Set 5**\n\n**V. Ride from West End**\n\nOn the way to Althain tower, the travellers stop near the town of West End. The princes are left in a glen at the edge of the forest next to the town with orders to wait there, while Asandir sets of on an errand of his own and Dakar goes to the town fair to purchase additional horses.\n\nDakar is late and the brothers grow bored of the wait. Curious to find out why they were specifically instructed to do nothing but wait, Arithon suggests a visit to the town’s autumn fair. Despite being weary of Asandir’s displeasure at the disobeyed order, Lysaer finds the new and unexpected prankster side of his half-brother infectious and decides to tag along.\n\nHedging bets on finding Dakar dead-drunk and face-down in a gutter as well as on how long it would take the prophet to get sober, the 2 princes venture into town.\n\n**Note** how wretched the town itself looks. Arithon instantly realizes West End was a seaport fallen into decline. With the Mistwraith covering the night sky, the great ships were no longer able to make port there.\n\n**Also note Lysaer’s difficulty to adjust to his new station.** Without valet and on foot, with no status, he tries to use the charm that had made the ladies on Dascen Elur fawn over him to obtain directions to the fair. His approach backfires though and instead of being fawned over, he gets threatened and called *“sly-faced drifter scum”.*\n\nConfused and wary because of the town-people’s reaction to them, the brothers head towards the fair and encounter Dakar, drunk and snoring in a gutter, sprawled on his back and covered with garbage. Arithon steals Dakar’s sack of coins (Dakar will not forget the slight!) and they resume their search of the fair with the intention of buying the horses Dakar was supposed to get.\n\n**Note** that the town’s people are speaking a with a different accent, while the people at the fair use one much closer to usage on Dascen Elur. The same language, one could even say, but evolved differently.\n\nWhen Arithon asks for the price of a gelding he confuses the trader:\\*“Daelion’s hells!! What clan are you from brother, and is this some jest, you here bidding like a townsman?”\\***So the “drifters” were clansmen.** Their speech differs from that of the townspeople and is accented the way the princes were speaking.\n\nThe gelding Arithon had asked for, was not for sale. It was the personal mount of a clan lord. And that fact alone turned Arithon’s inquiry into an insult. One clansman does not bid for the personal mount of another! And clansmen will never allow such an insult to pass.\n\nJust when the situation is about to get out of control, Asandir arrives and soothes everything out. He buys the gelding with a way beyond generous amount, and it is accepted because of his status/not the coin. He then takes the princes out of the fair and instructs them to wait while he goes after another horse.\n\n**Note his warning:** \\*“You’ve already left an impression with the drifters. Don’t cause more talk in West End, am I clear?”\\*Followed by another: *“…in this place, people associated with sorcerers very often wind up roasting in chains on a pile of oiled faggots.”*\n\n**– Why the warnings?** – In the previous chapter, the Fellowship determined to let the princes receive their impressions of Athera through direct observation. Do people hate sorcerers? Townspeople in particular!? And why would the brothers cause talk?Asandir is concerned that the folk who saw the brothers will talk. And *“the result might brew up a curiosity far better left to bide until later.”* \\- We’ll also come back to it later.\n\nThe party leaves West End after Asandir gets another horse for Arithon and collects Dakar from the gates (trussed and draped across the saddle – still drunk, stinking of garbage and snoring, despite being doused in cold water).\n\n**Note that Asandir takes special care to get Arithon a mare that will keep him busy.** He has to use his every shred of attention to keep her on the road. **– Why?** Does Asandir want to keep Arithon preoccupied so that he doesn’t think of his awaiting fate? Or is it something more? We’ll come back to it later.\n\nOn the way, we are told who *‘the drifters’* are – people whose ancestors once ruled in West End and who had been nomads since the time of the rebellion which threw down the high kings. **– Remember** Grithen's thought on that historical event in the previous chapter?\n\nDuring the party’s travel to Camris, there are **a few things we should take notice of:**\n\n**First** the Iyat who possesses Dakar’s cloak and tries to apparently strangle him.\n\n**The Iyats** are energy sprites native to Athera, not visible to the eye, who manifest in a poltergeist fashion by taking temporary possession of objects. They feed upon natural energy sources: fire, breaking waves, lightning, temperature change, etc. When you deal with Iyats, you have to restrain your emotions. Anger and distress only goad them on to greater mischief. – They will appear often in our story.\n\n**Second**, during the princes’ conversation in the night, Arithon’s answer to Lysaer’s question:\\*“If you could go anywhere, do anything, be anything you wanted, what would you choose?Not to go back to Karthan.”\\*As well as his conviction that the fate that awaits him won’t be pleasant.\n\n**The explanation for the carved standing stones in the forest:** *“In times past, creatures who were not human tended these forests. Attuned to the deepest pulses that bind land and soil to Ath’s harmony, they left stones such as these to show what ground and which trees could be taken for man’s use and which must stay whole to renew the mysteries. Once the protection of sacred ground was the province of high king’s justice. Pastures and fields were cut only where the earth could gracefully support them. But now such knowledge is scarce.”*\n\n**In other words:**\\- In the past the old races (Paravians) tended the forests- There is an universal energy binding the land and soil to exist in harmony- Some of the trees must stay whole to renew the mysteries (- these will be later explained)- The high kings were responsible for the protection of the sacred ground where the protected trees were growing.- The knowledge of that past is almost lost at present. We are also told that the last of the Paravians passed from the land when the Mistwraith swallowed the sunlight and no one knows where they have gone.\n\n**The minstrel met on the way.** He had been waylaid by a caravan, beaten and left on foot without his horse. **Note Asandir’s outrage:** *“Who in this land has dared to abuse a free singer?”* – In the previous chapter the caravan raid was called off because a bard was riding with it. And now Asandir’s outrage! **– music and those who bring it are highly valued on Athera!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Peaks of Tornir**\n\nFerilin the bard travels with the princes’ party and entertains everyone in the evenings with songs and ballads accompanied by the lyrante. Day after day he watches Arithon and suspects him of a bard’s talent or at least predisposition. He makes repeated attempts to entice Arithon out of his shell and make him sing but without success. Until one night when he uses Dakar and places a bet. Unable to resist the chance to humble Dakar, Arithon accepts the lyrante and plays, astonishing everyone, including Ferilin, who is now convinced the brooding young man has a masterbard’s talent. Angry because Arithon rejects his praise, Ferilind scolds him: *“How dare you waste such great talent! Can’t you accept your true calling?”*\n\n**Note the longing and sorrow in Arithon’s reply:** \\*“Daelion turns the wheel. One cannot always have the choice.”\\*And Asandir’s clarification: *“These are troubled times for all of us my friend. Arithon has the gift, none can doubt. But music cannot be his first calling.”* **– And there you go again!** The prince will again be forced to do what needs to be done and keep his dreams and desires aside.\n\nWhile approaching the Tornir pass, the travellers encounter the remains of the caravan who had waylaid Ferilin. Everyone was dead – killed by a pack of Khadrim who are still ahead, in the pass. Asandir urges everyone forward and warns Arithon that he will have to draw his sword when told to. At Dakar’s confusion he clarifies: the sword *“was forged ten and a half thousand years past, expressly for war against the Khadrim.”*\n\n**Note** that the nature of Alithiel had escaped all mages on Dascen Ellur and note how Arithon resents having to carry it, because he views it as only another symbol to tie him to an unwanted duty. **See** how envious Lysaer is of his brother’s possession! He would treasure the chance to bear such a great talisman. Arithon sees it and wants to give the sword to his brother as a gift. But Asandir forbids it.*“You can never relinquish that sword except to your own blood heir.”*\n\nAs they attempt to cross the pass, Arithon takes the lead and is attacked by a Khadrim. In an effort to keep his spooked mare under control, he reacts too late and the Khadrim engulfs him in fire. When the flames clear, both Arithon and the mare are untouched in the middle of a seared circle of carbon. **– Was that Arithon who raised shields?** How strong is he then to resist such a fire?\n\nOnce Alithiel is drawn, she gives off a peal of perfect harmony vibrating upon the air. She rings a perfect pure timbre and comes alive. *“Light ripped along the silvered lines of inlay, blindingly intense, a shimmer like harmony distilled to an exultation of universal creation.”*\n\nThe Khadrim shrieks in pain and crashes against the mountainside. Once it is dead, Alithiel’s light fades to a glimmer and dies away, leaving only plain black steel behind. **Note** that the runes inscribed on the steel were no longer familiar to Arithon after the sword stilled. – He had known them while she was in use.\n\nHere we get **the first glimpse at Alithiel’s power.** *“Asandir’s great powers seemed a brute statement”* compared with the energies of the sword. After wielding it, Arithon felt *“bereft, as if the world where he stood had grown coarser, more drab, somehow clumsy and lacking in a manner that defeated reason”.* – Why? – We’ll come back to it later.\n\n**Note Lysaer’s envy and desire! – Important!**\n\n**Alithiel’s Story**\n\nContinuing their way to Camris, the travellers make camp in a cave on the far slopes of Tornir Peaks.Around the fire, they complain about roads gone wild and winters coming early, all effects of the Mistwraith covering the sun. Asandir reveals to an astonished Ferilin that the two princes are the ones promised by Dakar’s prophecy and tells **the story of Alithiel** in the bargain.\n\nOver eighteen thousand years in the past, 12 blades were forged at Isaer by the Paravian armourer, Ffereton s’Darien, from the cinder of a fallen star.\n\nFfereton was Ilitharis, a centaur. The Isaer swords were his finest most famous creation, wrought at need to battle the vast packs of Khadrim that were the scourge of the Second Age. Each blade took five years’ labour, a full decade if one were to count the sorceries that went into the sharpening. The steel holds an edge that neither time nor battle can blunt.\n\nThe swords were given over to the fair folk, called sunchildren, for finishing. They made the hilt, chased the channels for the inlay, no two patterns the same.\n\nRiathan, the unicorns, sang the great spells of defence and infused the alloy with harmonics tuned to the primal chord of vibration used by Ath creator to kindle the first stars with light. Legend holds that 21 masters took a decade to endow Alithiel alone.\n\nAlong the centuries, the blade passed from centaurs to sunchildren until it was rewarded as a gift to a human, an ancestor of Arithon. And from that time only, it remained in human hands. Among the sunchildren, Alithiel was regarded as a symbol of kingship but wasn’t considered a cherished possession. In fact, it was rumoured to carry a tragic reputation of seeing the end of every royal line it belonged to, so no one dared to claim it. Among humans however, it was a prized possession. The emerald in the hilt was cut by a sunchild’s spells and the initial in the crest was changing according to the name of the bearer.\n\n**Note here a few more details about the old races:** The Paravians were not mortal as man might define. And they can be expected to survive for even eighteen thousand years.\n\nShaken by Asandir’s story and worried about his future, Arithon looks for solitude to try and sort out his thoughts. But he is cornered by Felirin who manages to extract an oath from him. There’s a singer. A Masterbard named Halliron. Arithon vows to play for him if he meets him. And he also vows to accept the offer of apprenticeship if the Masterbards should make it. He longs for the vow to be fulfilled but fears that it will never happen.\n\nHere we get again another little **insight into the two brother’s hopes and expectations.** Athera’s need to be released from the Mistwraith turns into Lysaer’s purpose. His lifeline into an unknown world, completely different from his own! And on the other side, it drives Arithon to despair. Because here again he will be forced to choose what he must do, instead of what he longs to do. And what if here again he’ll fail? (hide spoiler)\\]\n\n**Backtrail**\n\n\\[The news of the two princes speaking the old tongue is spreading among the drifters, who foresee war, as well as among the townspeople who inform the mayor (all of a sudden sweating).\n\nThe Khadrim warn each other of a spell-cursed steel not seen for thousand years and retreat back to spell-warded sanctuary where they can be safe from it. **Note:** the Khadrim communicate and coordinate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Set 6**\n\n**VI. Erdane**\n\nElaira, Koriani enchantress and message-bearer for the prime, enters Erdane and heads on an errand of her own, without sanction from her superiors. Note that she was the first of her kind to pass the city gates for close to four hundred years. Erdane is a dangerous place for anyone connected to sorcery or the old ways.\n\n*“Unlike the commoners and the craftsmen, the mayor of Erdane and the guildmasters had access to archives that detailed a history of conspiracy and murder.”* – The very same one Grithen recounted. And because they remember, they are afraid!\n\n\\*”They fear that powers from the past might arise out of legend and claim vengeance. To them, the sun was no myth but a harbringer of sorcery and certain doom.”\\*Clansmen and people suspected of sorcery, they were all burned at the stake without trial if caught.\n\nElaira knows the risks but is willing to chance them, because she wants to see for herself if her suspicions are true and if the Westgate Prophecy is on the way to fulfillment.\n\nThe mayor’s most persistent nightmare was indeed already half-way realized as Asandir and two old-blood princes were already temporarily in residence in a warded house, on a warded street in Erdane: the home of the seeress Enithen Tuer.\n\n**Note the warning the seeress gave Elaira** when she asked to be allowed entrance: *“You may be sorry”,* followed by: *“you don’t need a seer to tell your future’s just branched into darkness.”* – **Important!** Does she mean that Elaira will get into trouble for coming there without the Order’s permission? Or something else?\n\n\\*\\*Note the contrast between the brothers’ appearance and behaviour in this scene.\\*\\*Lysaer – golden, elegant and handsome, possessing the dignity of a man schooled to listen and a pride unselfconscious as breathing, courteous and smiling, he instantly rises to meet Elaira.Arithon – black haired and blending into shadow, shocking Elaira with his awareness of one trained power meeting another, he stays back and observes.\n\nElaira confesses her curiosity to Asandir, trusting that, unlike a Koriani senior, this sorcerer would pass no judgement upon her and no debt would be set on her demands. **– Important!** The Koriani Order will set a debt upon fulfilling any demand and will judge everything an enchantress of their own order does.\n\nAsandir is satisfying her curiosity but informs her that he expects the information to be treated with a foresight her superiors might hold in contempt. **- Another insight into the Order’s ways!**\n\nAnd within his explanation we finally get to fully understand **the relationship between the Rauven Mages and The Fellowship.** *“In the times of rebellion when four of the high kings’ heirs were sent to safety through West Gate, the Fellowship granted foundational training to the Teir’s’Ahelas to increase her line’s chances of survival. Her descendants on Dascen Elur continued her tradition but forgot certain of the guidelines. In the course of five centuries of isolation, the mages there achieved what the Seven could not.”****If you’d like to know how that came to be, refer to the short story*** [***Child of Prophecy***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19064487.Child_of_Prophecy__Wars_of_Light___Shadow_)*.*\\*\\*\n\n**Note also his observation:** *“What is possible does not always coincide with what is wise.”* – Elemental mastery is an immense power that might cause a great deal of harm, if entrusted into the wrong hands.\n\nThe Order had been dedicated to intolerance according to Asandir and Elaira admits it and justifies with the fact that her seniors hate to admit to incompetence. **That should tell us a bit more about the character of the witches!**\n\nBut Elaira is different and Asandir warns her: *“You have a clear eye for truth. Don’t replace one mistaken set of principles for others as narrow minded.”* – **Why?** What is he warning her about, what change of ideals? Is Elaira important somehow? Why would Asandir take a chance on her when the Fellowship and the Order are at odds? **– Important to watch out for.**\n\n**Note also Elaira’s worry.** Asandir had not used her but he easily could have, which means the Prime’s Circle fears about the Fellowship were not in the least unfounded. **– Here we get the first insight into the Order-Fellowship relationship:** The Order fears and is at odds with the Seven!Insight reinforced by Elaira’s conclusion: *“Arrogance did not admit fallibility, and reticence did not offer explanation; about the Fellowship, the Koriani Senior Circle was emphatically mistaken.”*\n\nHaving fulfilled her errand, Elaira is aware that the lane watch enchantress will be turning her attention towards her soon and wants to conceal her meeting with Asandir. If her escapade were to be found out, she would be severely reprimanded and the secrets entrusted by Asandir could not be kept hidden. So she decides to create a diversion and meet up with the Mad Prophet betting on that being worse than meeting a sorcerer of the Fellowship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Set 6**\n\n**The Four Ravens**\n\nThe Inn of Four Ravens was a rough place; the hangout of head-hunters, labourers and off-duty garrison soldiers. The last place an enchantress would want to be! But Elaira sits there at a table and plays cards with a half-drunk Dakar, waiting for the initiate on lane-watch to turn her attention towards her. Felirin the Scarlet happens to be the minstrel appointed for the night.\n\nDakar promptly passes out overcome by drink and excitement, perhaps an avoidance because he sees Arithon entering the Inn all alone. Frustrated because she still hadn’t been spotted in Dakar’s company by the enchantress on watch, Elaira is trying to literally kick the Mad Prophet awake, when she notices Arithon.\n\nHe was standing, as if frozen in mid-gesture, staring at the blazon of the old s’Ilessid sovereign dynasty of Tysan, with a look of shocked confusion on his face. **– Why?** Was he trying to remember and Asandir’s block was getting in his way? Was he recognizing the blazon from his past on Dascen Elur, and if so, the congruency tells him something.\n\nIn a daze, he tries to snap out of it and jostles someone at the bar. In the rush of the moment, Arithon apologizes and his accent alone is enough for the whole room to surge into motion and try to land hands on the intruder. Arithon is cornered and fights his attackers with a pot hook, making a stand against the pantry door. Worried that someone may sally from the pantry and skewer the prince, Felirin and Elaira decide to help out.\n\nFelirin causes a distraction and Elaira centers her mind in her focusing jewel, cobbling together a glamour of concealment and disappears. **Note that she didn’t literally vanish** but assumed an aura of sameness, as a chameleon would, to blend in. Praying the she won’t be discovered by the enchantress on watch who is still due to check on her, Elaira secures the door behind Arithon’s back with a hard rune of binding and rushes through the back door, through the scullery and pantry and opens the door behind Arithon herself. Seeing no other solution to save him from the blood-thirsty mob, Elaira knocks Arithon unconscious with a spell, disguising it with a blow from a pastry-roller to his head. **Note Arithon’s amusement before he passes out. – Why?** We’ll come back to it later.\n\nElaira uses her power to divert the emotions of the crowd, laying a spell of influence and illusion over them and manages to convince them to throw the prince out the back door. Together with Felirin, they take the still unconscious prince to the hayloft next to the Inn.\n\nThe enchantress expects the prince to be royally pissed when he awakes, instead, she’s the one who starts scolding. How could Arithon be so reckless and come to that particular inn alone!? How is it that he didn’t know his speech would turn him into a target!? And in her indignation she reveals to Arithon what Asandir was trying to keep hidden: that he is *Teir’s’Ffalenn,* prince and heir apparent of the crown of Rathain.\n\nThe revelation allows Arithon to break through Asandir’s memory block and then we see him flying into a blind-sided rage. Because **Teir’s’Ffalenn – is ‘successor to power’,** because the high king crowned in Rathain had always been a s’Ffalenn, and because, extrapolates the possibility that: *“The people of Rathain are subject to misery and strife and Ithamon, his ruling seat, is a ruin in a wasteland.”* And above all because, once again, he is supposing he may be forced to choose what must be done, instead of what his heart desires, only to possibly fail in the end.\n\n*“A bad king revels in his importance. A good one hates his office. He spends himself into infirmity quashing deadly little plots to make power the tool of the greedy…. There’s very little beauty in satisfaction and justice rewards nobody with joy.”*\n\nIt is then that Elaira realizes Arithon had not actually been in real peril in the taproom. The pot hook was only a diversion since he had both mage training and shadow mastery carefully held in reserve. He was himself planning on getting out through the pantry when Elaira interfered and knocked him out cold. That’s why his amusement before passing out.\n\nGrateful for her interference, Arithon offers to accompany Elaira to her lodgings but she refuses. *“I can find my way just fine. The question is can you?”* – **Note that she doesn’t refer to the wards concealing the seeress’s house.**\n\nAmused by the thought she thinks he may need guidance, Arithon promises to hide the whole affair from Asandir, gently pulls Elaira to her feet and starts plucking the loose hay from her hair. At that moment precisely, the junior initiate on lane watch stumbles across Elaira’s presence and responds with self-righteous indignation. Apparently, speaking with princes in haylofts after midnight was an offense considered even worse than visiting sorcerers of the Fellowship or engaging in card games with disreputable apprentice prophets. Elaira will now have to face her personal version of Asandir, an enchantress by far not so understanding.\n\n**Guardian of Mirthlvain**\n\nMirthlvain Swamp, between the peaks of the Tiriacs and the north shore of Methlas Lake, was a place where even the boldest were reluctant to thread. Its pools spawned horrors that the efforts of two civilizations had failed to contain and it was one of the places that the Fellowship never for an instant left unwatched, despite being grievously shorthanded.\n\nMaster spellbinder Verrain is the Swamp’s appointed guardian, ensuring that none of the deadly creatures breeding there ever escape. And he is constantly searching for evidence to track the recombinant forms as the meth-spawn are continuously mutating.\n\n**Meth-snakes** – cross-bred genetic mutations left over from a First-Age creature called a methuri (hatewraith). Related to iyats, these energy creatures possessed live hosts, which they infested and altered to produce mutated offspring to create weakened lines of stock and thereby widen their choice of potential host animals. They come in many forms, ranging from harmless to virulently poisonous. One of the most venomous kind carry a toxin called cierl-ankeshed. In contact with human skin, it causes dissolution of nerve tissue. Paralysis is almost instant, with death following days later. Without a known antidote, the poison is caustic and can be absorbed through the skin.In his search, Verrain discovers a meth-snake with cierl-ankeshed – a threat that the Fellowship had hoped to be eradicated.\n\n***If you want to know how Verrain came to be the guardian of Mirthlvain, you will find his story in the novella The Gallant, available as e-book exclusively in the***  [Maitz and Wurts Studio Shop](https://www.paravia.com/StudioShop/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=23_41_42)\n\nThis novella can be read at any time, independent of the main series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Observations**\n\nA raven alights on the shoulder of a sorcerer dressed all in black and wearing a broad-brimmed hat with a patterned silver band –**Take note of him. He is important!**\n\nThe enchantress on the watch reports to the prime, that Elaira has visited Erdane without permission and had clandestine meetings with a prince in a hayloft.\n\nSethvir sends a thought warning to Asandir prompting him to hurry across the Camris, because trouble is pending, from a migrant strain of meth-snakes with confirmed cierl-ankeshed venom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat would be all for today's chapters. But if I missed anything, please let me know. :)\n\nI'm looking forward to your comments, as well as the next chapters in our read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**To see the schedule of this read-along click** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/qoqeln/curse_of_the_mistwraith_readalong_schedule_what/)**.**",

        "body": "Hello, I'm on my third reread of The Witcher series and I've finally decided to ask this question.  I've always felt that the translation of the Polish word \"Pogardy\" to  the English \"Contempt\" was not exactly the right translation in context of the story.  Contempt means condescension or disdain, but when I checked online, some have suggested \"anger\" might be a better translation.  when reading the book, it seems the dialogue situates the meaning of the word as \"a discontent\" or \"having a grievance.\"  I'm just curious to know others' thoughts about this.  I work in translation from Arabic to English, and I don't know Polish, but sometimes a direct translation is not always best to retain meaning and context. Is \"contempt\" the best option for this translation?",

        "title": "Ok, I know I'm late to the party, but what the f--k Cowboy Bebop? (Spoilers for the entire show)",
        "body": "I have never watched a show I felt so strangely fragmented about. Like, it's not just mixed, it's WEIRDLY mixed. \n\n\nFirst, some background. I am, naturally, a fan of the original Cowboy Bebop, having seen it maybe dozens of times at this point. No, I can't remember every frame or detail, but that's not because I haven't seen it a lot or that I don't like it a lot, it's just that I like enjoying the show as it comes over me rather than encyclopedically documenting every quanta. I am not, however, the kind of fan who thinks that deviation from the original text in an adaptation is sacrilege, nor did I ever delude myself into any impression that the live action Cowboy Bebop would be even in the same ZIP code of quality as the original show-- but I was ok with that: I'd take more Cowboy Bebop even if it were Cowboy Bebop lite, or even the Community Center Presents version. \n\nI say all this to convey how little I was predisposed to hate this show, how inclined I was toward leniency, and how in many places this show satisfies or sometimes impresses me. Faye Valentine isn't the Faye Valentine of the show at all-- but arguably that Faye maybe wouldn't have translated, so they put a spin on it. It works, even if her cornball of a 'mother' provides an ample cringes. Jet is maybe even better than his anime counterpart, he's less grumpy but warmer; controversially, I think giving him a daughter wasn't a terrible interpretation. It does fundamentally change him as a character, but that isn't a dealbreaker with me, and his essential nature and role on the ship-- which was ship dad anyway-- remains the same. John Cho's Spike is the weakest of the bunch, when he's acting gregarious you can almost see the strain lines on his face. Cho doesn't do outgoing well, and his performance at it is saccharine. But when he's being dryly sarcastic and just quipping with Jet, they have a fine vibe (even if, again, sometimes they pull in for some cringe laughs), and Cho's walk is *exactly* like Spike's. In fact, everything on the Bebop mostly works. It's not the greatest ensemble I've ever seen , but it's serviceable, and on that alone, we have a fine foundation for some fine diverting television. \n\nIf only that's all there was.\n\nEverything involving the Syndicate makes me want to implode. I hate everything. I hate the way it's shot, I hate the sets, I hate every single character involved except Spike, and even then I hate Spike when he's acting in this side of the plot. It's the fucking worst. Julia is a hateful, unlikeable shrew whose appeal is as baffling as the amount of focus the showrunners of heaped upon her, her turn in the finale of this show might be the most insulting thing I've seen on television all year. She's so bad that she makes Spike a worse character just as collateral; what kind of person is he if he could fall so hopelessly in love with a character with so little appeal and chemistry? Moreover, she's desperately miscast. She kinda looks like a Kardashian, not the kinda woman that would pull up and make a getaway with Faye Valentine. \n\nWhat they've done to Vicious's character is character assassination, they've completely obliterated him, and again, hit Spike as collateral. Vicious in the anime is *vicious*. This is a guy that discarded a man who considered him his best friend, his battle-forged brother-- like *nothing*. This is a guy who watches a longtime bodyguard take a bullet and *die* and not even react. This man's lover is gunned down and all he can do is babble about old grudges. *He doesn't give a shit about anything*, that's what makes him formidable, a match for Spike. The two are twinned, they talk about how they can only be the ones to kill one another.\n\nWell, fuck that, now he's a sniveling trust fund brat who literally *no one respects* (his own bodyguard abets his wife's betrayal at the cost of her own life) who is cuckolded and stays with his wife for completely inscrutable reasons, has daddy issues, and has to work himself up, sobbing, to kill Julia to further his own interests. He's *pathetic*. He's so contemptible that his lack of value neuters the drama of any eventual showdown with Spike.\n\nGren is NOT Gren, they've COMPLETELY drained the gravitas out of that character for, again, completely inscrutable reasons. There are CONSTANT dutch angles-- why? Dutch angles enforce a sense of unreality; is this the showrunners' attempt to remind us that this comes from anime source material? If that's the case, that's a terrible idea, stop it.\n\nSo many decisions in very specific portions of this show are *bad*, and not just bad, *agonizingly*, *unwatchably*, *incomprehensibly* bad, but the foundations of the show are really solid and all the Beboppin' is perfectly fine. I don't know what they were *thinking*! What do you guys think?",

        "title": "Prince of Thorns was much better than I expected",
        "body": "I was on my audibook marathon and after \"The First Law\" trilogy I needed some rest from Abercrombie. I was intrigued by Daniel Greene's review of Prince of Throrns but didn't expect much of it. Two and a half books later I have new favorite fantasy setting and protagonist.\n\nI definetly recomend this book if you're into grimdark fantasy and don't mind first person perspective. I think it's worth reading just because how engaging it is. Author works with first person narration very well, because it's interesting to follow the story while being in character's head. Pacing doesn't drag on, because slow parts of the story are filled with introspection, or giving you some pieces about the world, or other characters, or something completley mundane. Rarely perspective jumps to other characters and those parts are just as good. Setting is also very interesting, but you barely see it in the first book. It does look like meh medieval Europe fantasy first, but you get to see much more later on.\n\nJorg is... interesting. He was definetly meant to be a psychopath in the first book, because there is a noticable character progression in the next books. In the first book he was hateful, driven purely by  vengeance. He used people who were loyal to him, who he called brothers as cannon fodder. A lot of people died, including innocent people, just because he didn't care about consequences of his actions.\n\nIn the second book he became much more self-aware, responsible, learned to care about other people, developed some empathy, learned to manage his anger, he regrets about horrible things he've done in the past. And he >!committed even more atrocities. Thousands of people died, a lot of them with horrible deaths, because of his ambitions to become an emepror. He kept using people who were loyal to him, including those who he called brothers, as cannon fodder. He himself doubted if he would be a good emperor, and whether he should stop, but eventually he started a bloodbath just to prove his superiority.  !<  But I think he is far from being Joffrey or Ramsay, or that angry austrian watercolor artist. And quite often (but not always), people who oppose him are much worse than him, like his father.\n\nIMO, his edginess is also exaggerated. The books starts from description of him burning a village so it shocked some people. But he isn't edgier than Ciri (remember Rats?) or Ferro Maljin. Morally dubious, reckless, spiteful, >!being 14 years old!< \\- yes, but I didn't find any extra *edge* added on top.\n\nOther cycles (red queen's war, sisters trilogy) happen in the same universe? Finishing \"Emperor of Thorns\" and really looking forward to get deeper into this universe.",

        "title": "Who is the unexpected someone Cahir will run into in Season 2 of the Netflix Witcher Show?",
        "body": "*\"Look, Cahir is out in the woods. He's lost. He's trying to get his way home. He's got an existential crisis just gnawing at his little ear there. It's fun stuff. He's on the run and he runs into someone that is quite unexpected. And I think there is a little vibe.\"*\n\n*\"My favourite episodes to shoot was three and four. I loved every second of three and four. It's with the actor that I mentioned. The character that he runs into before. And for me it was the culmination of possibility for him. So that was really fun. We had a blast.\"* (Eamon Farren at the Witcher premiere in London on December 1st)\n\n**Who do you think this unexpected someone that Eamon mentions could be?**\n\nI guess we can safely rule out Geralt and Ciri and any other witchers since they would be at Kaer Morhen in episodes 3 and 4. Meeting Fringilla would probably not be very unexpected and special. The photo from the trailer with Fringilla and Cahir in his new, upgraded armour must be from a later episode after he has managed to find his way back to Nilfgaard or at least territory ruled by Nilfgaard, Cintra for example. There is, of course, this scene with Cahir and Tissaia, but it does not exactly look like a lot of fun for Cahir (unless he is a total masochist), so we can probably rule her out, too.\n\nSo it could be:\n\n\\- Yennefer who is said to make unlikely new alliances in season two. Anya Chalotra has been a good friend of Eamon's since the ABC murders, so they both would probably enjoy filming scenes together a lot. And Yennefer might be on the run too, from the elves who kidnapped her, before she meets up with Geralt and Ciri in a later episode. Cahir and Yennefer might actually have something else in common as they were both tortured in the same stone chair. However, this would probably only work as long as they have no idea who the other really is and what role they played in the battle of Sodden Hill. Yen would most probably hex Cahir into tomorrow if she knew that he was the one who ordered the attack. And Cahir would surely not feel any vibes, at least not positive ones, knowing that Yennefer was the one who barbecued most of his army. It could work out for a while though if they kept each other in the dark about their identities. Liking Yen would be a very good reason for Cahir to help Geralt later on in the show, too.\n\n\\- Triss Merigold before she joins the witcher's at Kaer Morhen to take care of Ciri, maybe on her way there. Anna Shaffer and Eamon Farren also seem to be good friends as there are several photos of them together which could hint at the two having shot some scenes together. But this would also only work if Triss did not know who Cahir was as ultimately he was the reason why she was badly burned during the battle of Sodden Hill. If he develops feelings for her, her scars, on the other hand, could really lead to some existential crisis for Cahir knowing that he was to blame.\n\n\\- Jaskier before he is reunited with Geralt. The two actors would probably have a lot of fun together and Jaskier and Cahir are so very different that it would probably also provide some great interaction, maybe Cahir protecting Jaskier with his fighting skills and hunting for them and Jaskier trying (probably in vain) to make Cahir talk and laugh. This temporary kind of friendship could also be a reason why Cahir wants to join Geralt's company later and why Jaskier is against just leaving Cahir to his fate.\n\n\\- Francesca Findabair since she is pregnant later on in the series and that almost never happens between two elves anymore but, if at all, usually with a human (at least that's what the books say if I remember correctly). Francesca would probably help Cahir get back to Nilfgaard (maybe even help him escape from imprisonment by the northern kings) since she is allied with Vilgefortz and Emhyr var Emreis, and they could have an affair.\n\n\\- Rience (hopefully not, or if so only as a deterrent for Cahir ever to become anything like that evil sorcerer)\n\n\\- Sabrina Glevissig\n\n\\- Filavandriel\n\n\\- a Witcher who is late or does not intend to go to Kaer Morhen\n\nAny other ideas?\n\nWhat do you think is most likely?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qwme6xdw8e381.jpg?width=2143&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abdf5b428342ddc376f6e4cf0b2d7c75ec3f714d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/r89e0v)",

What do you think about them and Steiven?\n\nAnd how about Arithon's behaviour and the clan's reaction?\n\nOr the ladies in these chapters? Talith, Lirenda and especially Elaira?\n\nWe also get the first insight into Morriel’s character. Any thoughts about that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***And in case any of you would like to discuss the finer points:***\n\nWhich of those deep insights revealed in the conversation between Elaira and Morriel do you suspect will play out, and how, in the coming course of the series? Which observation do you think is 'right' - which do you trust?\n\nIn Chapter 16 - *“My sword, you’ll recall, is now wedded to the cause of a kingdom.”* **–** Did you note the confirmation that Arithon has already surrendered his personal preference? *“if, if, if!”* The choice was never his. That is what he believes. But is that really so?\n\nAnd concerning Desh-thiere's bid for coercion: *“Where opening did not already exist, the creature could not have gained foothold.”* \\- Does this make you wonder about the integrity of Lysaer's character?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny questions? Or perhaps other points you'd like us to discuss?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DETAILED CHAPTER SUMMARIES**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Set 15**\n\n**XV. STRAKEWOOD**\n\nThe last of the storms Kharadmon released encountered the fierce darkness of Arithon’s shadows and for a while, nature got warped and snow fell in green spring.\n\nAfter three days and two nights of blind flight, Arithon is intercepted by Steiven’s scouts and taken to the barbarian encampment where Lord Steiven already awaits him. He is given the welcome and acknowledgment of a rightful ruler by the clan chieftain and his followers.\n\nArithon is shaken, bone-tired, and his effort make his newly found caithdein understand that he neither desires nor welcomes his title and inheritance, but his arguments fall on deaf ears. The gathered chieftains insist their destiny is to defend their liege. And Etarra will rise against the clans regardless of whether Arithon is sheltered among them or not. The prince’s choice is simple: *forsake the clans and allow them to die for an empty title or make a stand with them and grant them the meaningful purpose of dying for a living sovereign.*\n\nNone of Arithon’s protests move them. Not his confession of being a bastard, nor the fact he is cursed by Deshtiere! The only one who holds trepidation is Caolle, the clan's veteran war captain, but even his reserve cannot turn Steiven’s set course. **Take note of Caolle as a character to watch!**\n\nArithon’s objections are obliterated by the caithdein, leaving him cornered with no escape. Even the corpse of the girl child that Arithon had carried in his arms throughout his flight, perished of injuries sustained while enslaved in Etarra’s warehouses firms the reason the clans’ stand to fight.*Townsmen have held the clansmen’s lives cheaply since centuries before the prince’s birth, and for less cause than seizing children for forced labor.*\n\nCornered and exhausted, finally told that Steiven has already foreseen the time and manner of his death (in the coming battle, this is implied), Arithon has no choice but to bend in agreement. While his needs are attended, the war council plans and launches the muster for war that very night.\n\n**Of note in this encounter are the reactions of Halliron,** present in his standing as Athera's Masterbard during Arithon’s arrival. Due to the training of his office, he pays keen attention to the prince’s reactions and notices small details that redouble his watchful observation.\n\nThe clans relocate east of the Tal Quorin river, with the utmost urgency, to prepare the ground for their stand against Etarra’s troops. Their camp is broken before dawn. Their life is hard, and the customs born of necessity for survival are even harder. Any person unfit for travel would normally be given a mercy stroke and abandoned where they lay. since litters for the wounded or the infirm pose a hindrance to those still hale. And Arithon is not fit for travel! After 3 days of flight with no rest, he falls asleep despite his best attempt to to keep pace, he tumbles from the saddle, forcing the scouts to haul him as dead weight.Despised for his weakness, he is left behind to recuperate with the pregnant women and young children, who move at a slower pace than the advance party with the warband.\n\nAware of the clans’ contempt for him, Arithon decides to reinforce it, exaggerating his delicacy and pretending complete ignorance to life in the wilds. He aims to drive home the impression of uselessness - both to provoke the clans to disown him, and also to mask his attributes as a trained asset. He also needs to seize time in strict privacy to enable to a scrying with tienelle to seek better odds on the outcome for the upcoming battle. Once Etarra’s invasion had been repulsed, he hopes the disdain of the clan chieftains will drive them to release him from the blood bonds of sovereigity, for the clans would be burdened by *a useless addle-headed dreamer for their king*! **(Take note, for future volumes, here: that Arithon is very likely assuming a great deal concerning the purpose of his heritage, and the supposition he is playing on may not line up with the actual functions he would serve as fully crowned sovereign.)**\n\nThrough the next days of travel, Arithon immerses himself in play with the children and even carves them whistles, to the fury and dismay of the women, who fear undue noise will draw the head-hunters upon them. They are all unaware aware that Arithon had already set precautions against that: wards of protection and others, to mute noise. All along, he has not been walking aimlessly through the forest but using his training from Rauven's mages to maintain everyone's safety. Halliron alone pierces the mask of foolishness that Arithon has projected. Suspecting the prince is more than he seems, and charged by his calling to bear witness to history, the masterbard remains with the clans and bears close watch on the prince whenever the occasion arises. He notices Arithon’s love for music, and studies his resentment and intention, until one moment, catching Arithon unawares, he discovers the fact that this prince has been mage trained - more, that Arithon is also putting to use what he knows to safeguard the clan women and children - without anyone knowing.\n\nA brief confrontation sparks when Arithon discovers the Masterbard has caught him out. Arithon's response - you will have grasped by now - is prickly to drive off the masterbard's curiosity and worse: the ability to perceive his true self, and the intense need to allow that intimacy from a fellow musician. The pain driven exchange almost fools Halliron -but not quite. He emphatically grasps that this prince regards him as a threat and is irked for not being able to uncover the reason.\n\nUpon arrival into the valley of Tal Quorin, Arithon Teir’s’Ffalenn receives oath of fealty from the clans, despite rebellious mutters of contempt, and open gossip over the prince’s weakness. The discourtesies and sullen resentment are cut short by Steiven, who must hope that his liege will snap out of his unseemly brooding and shoulder his heritage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Attraction**\n\nEtarra prepared for war. The forges are hammering out weapons and armour, while recruits are drilled for the assault. Talk of war is on everyone’s lips and the high born elite are left side-lined. To compensate they throw frenzied parties, burying themselves in fawning admirers and wild escapades.\n\nTalith and her brother Diegan, who would have been front and center at every frivolity in the past, now find them silly before the gravity of the coming conflict. Talith yearns for Lysaer’s presence, for his humour that didn’t belittle and his air of controlled power not bought through brutish intrigues and bribes.\n\nLysaer finds her taking the air on a balcony outside the festivities, the night before the army marches out. Through an intimate exchange, he confesses his fear of failing to kill his half-brother. **Note how well-set his intention has become. How right and just the cause is!** He displays the deep hatred for the s’Ffalenn line as he relates his personal memories from Dascen Elur!**And note Talith’s relief** when she realizes he is not posturing for favor: the prince actually cares for her well-being and her happiness! This straightforward admission is a novel, and while she feels it worth following through, Lysaer defers her. The war must come first, and her interest must wait until afterward, when he has standing to offer her his undivided attention.\n\n**Deduction**\n\nAt Narms, Elaira is summoned before the Prime and Lirenda and is informed that Lysaer has roused Etarra to war and has marched with an army ten thousand strong to hunt down the clans and Arithon. She is shown through scried images that Tal Quorin’s banks have been riddled with death-traps by the barbarians and is thrown the reverse, that her visit to Asandir had not escaped the Prime’s notice after all.\n\nTo wrest that misdemeanor to the order's advantage, Elaira is ordered to fashion a clear recall of each of the princes, a precise enough view to open the insight into their personal characters. The spells used to unmask such a deep sounding are perilous: the intimacy exposed to view often bind the participant to the subject under study through bonds of emotion and insight, inciting sympathy nearly impossible to deny. The experience might even overwhelm Elaira’s spirit completely, but a prime's direct order cannot be deined. The Koriani owns Elaira, flesh and mind, and disobedience to the Prime's will would invite her destruction.\n\n**Note the conversation between Lirenda and the Prime**, while Elaira prepares for trance. The Prime is fully aware that the ritual of clear recall is bound to deepen Elaira’s feelings for Arithon and spoil her future career in the order. Even ruined, Elaira poses a valuable tool, a window into Arithon’s character that will be desperately needed later on. The flawed instrument she becomes can serve as no other can, before the day comes when she will be driven to break and forsake her vows.\n\n**This scene opens the first insight into Morriel’s character.** Old and weary, terrified to become the first Prime to meet death without the necessity of a trained successor, she regards Lirenda, the 43rd candidate to her office, as a mere cipher. Her attached interest in the particulars of any candidate, and any affection for them, had died with the first one to fail.\n\nUnder the narcotic given to enhance her awareness, Elaira exerts her powers of recall to open a memory of Arithon first. She chooses the moment when Arithon was entertaining the street children with the shadow-wrought brigantine, unaware he was being observed. The infallible accuracy of Elaira's insight unveils Arithon’s vulnerable inner heart.\n\nContemplating the opening to bring him down, Lirenda suggests that *“killing will unman him, for s’Ffalenn conscience must force him over time to back down.”*But Morriel focuses on his hands before his eyes. She suggests the deceit Arithon so easily displays is rooted in the gift of true farsight from the s’Ahelas royal line.\n\nNext, Elaira displays an image of Lysaer in the garden, caught in an introspective moment of soul-rending self-distaste. Both Lirenda and Morriel grasp how s’Ilessid justice wars with the propensity for s’Ahelas farsight. Both recognize how Desh-thiere’s influence choke Lysaer's character, until pity and mercy seem absent.\n\nBoth Morriel and Lirenda are convinced that Arithon is the more dangerous due to an incompatible legacy that leaves his mind fatally flawed. But Elaira insists they are wrong. She reckons Lysaer's flawed nature as the greater peril, as charisma, coupled with his ingrained bias towards noble principles are powerful incentives the prince will wield to inspire a fanatical following.\n\nBut her fears are dismissed. Lysaer’s course is deemed predictable by the Prime, and what can be anticipated can also be controlled and prevented. Arithon’s actions, in turn, pose a wild card, an *'incompatible legacy' born of two royal gifts, which in Morriel’s opinion, makes him far more dangerous. Elaira insists: \"He is conscious of his actions as Lysaer can never be\"*\n\n**Take particular note of the statement as Morriel agrees:** ***\"Which is precisely what makes him dangerous....Lysaer's sense of justice and farsight will answer to logic, and therefore be reconciled by compromise. But since when can (Arithon's) compassion ever be made to condone pain: S'Ahelas blood gives Arithon full grasp of cause and effect; mage training compounds this with awareness of the forward reactions of power. These traits aligned against the s'Ffalenn gift of sympathetic empathy cancels the mind's self-defenses. The shelter of petty hatred becomes untenable. Arithon is a visionary placed at the nexus of responsibility. Desh-thiere's curse will embroil him in violence he can neither escape nor master. Stress will prove his undoing, for the sensitivities of poets have ever been frail, and the broadened span of his thinking shall but inflame and haunt him to madness.\"***\n\n**And Elaira's response:** ***\"you're mistaken.\"*** Based on her recall of the whiplash resilience the living man had possessed, *\"As Ath is my witness, the conclusion you've drawn from this is wrong.\"*\n\n**Which observation is 'right' - which do you trust? Which of these deep insights will play out, and how, in the coming course of the series?**\n\n**Note Elaira’s regret and guilt at the end of this chapter.** By exposing Arithon's private self in attempt to win Arithon’s protection from the consuming threat of her order's interest, in sad fact, she may have betrayed him by unwittingly providing her Order with a powerful weapon against him.\n\n**Daybreak**\n\nLirenda’s dreams are haunted by s’Ffalenn green eyes, deep with a compassion expressive enough to leave her weeping and desolate till dawn.\n\nDeshir’s clansmen continue building traps in the marshes flanking Tal Quorin while their prince is conspicuously absent. Young Jieret takes it upon himself to pursue the mystery of the prince’s behavior.\n\nThe caravan master who had been paid with one of Rathain’s crown jewels by Arithon is perplexed, wondering why he decided to just hand over the jewel when Sethvir simply asked for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Set 16**\n\n**XVI. AUGURY**\n\nIn a solitary forest glen, removed from the clan’s activities, Arithon fasts in trance for twelve uninterrupted hours, to prepare himself for deep scrying. Given the means to tap prescient visions through Rauven’s teaching and the narcotic herb tienelle filched from Sethvir, he resolves to ensure no lives would be needlessly endangered by casting his mind into a review of all possible futures.\n\nHe knows from trained experience that trance under influence of tienelle should never be attempted while alone, since the poisonous side effects can become too dangerous to manage without help. Yet Arithon disregards the grave risks.*“The endangerment to Rathain’s feal vassals must be shouldered, while every minute the temptation to take and twist clan trust into a weapon to bring down Lysaer ate like a darkness at his heart.”* **– Important! Arithon is well aware the curse is trying force itself over free will. His fight to prevent it is a constant threat.**\n\nThe the visions begin, showing reeling holocaust Fire, smoke and death pervade all possible futures! He sees clan children executed, corpses and rivers of spilled blood! Caolle’s prudently laid strategy will yield nothing but disaster! Arithon searches through thousands of alternate outcomes, but every single one leads to ruin! Left to their own resource, he finds the clans will be destined for slaughter to last man!\n\nTraumatized by unbearable grief for their sacrifice (and driven by his royal empathy), Arithon decides! He lays his dreams of peace and music aside; he rejects the outcome he survived on Dascen Elur! He will *”give his whole mind and bend the talents his grandfather had nurtured to full-scale killing.”* He tests new strategies contributing magecraft and shadow mastery to turn the slaughter aside; the tests housands of variations that brooked no conscience. He counts the dead closing his heart to sorrow, while he weighs and recombines the results of each chain of possible happenstance, until he forges an alternate path. *“Only a scant third of Steiven’s clansmen could be kept alive”,* but the third is still better than none. *“Bitterness squeezed his heart for what felt like a tragic failure… How could a prince, mage or otherwise, brook the scale of such sacrifice?”* Etarra would suffer even greater losses, for a small reprieve that still would be devastating!\n\nWith the scrying completed and strategy set, wrung to sickness by the herb's side effects, Arithon remains in the glen, physically worn and scarcely fit to surmount and clear the toxic residue left by the tienelle from his body. He is still torn open, and sensitive to visions, when Jieret waylays him. Arithon strives to handle the encounter with tact, aware he is in no condition to do so. The boy has mettle enough to provoke, aware of the contempt of his elders. He tries to swear fealty to Arithon and annoyed at being refused due to his young age, he justifies his worthiness by shaming his liege over the strength of clansmen, who will not hesitate to dispatch their daughters into the conflict. The mention hurls Arithon into prescience and he foresees the horrific, violent death of every single clan woman and daughter.\n\nDetermined to prevent this fresh disaster, Arithon musters his strength to seek Steiven. Asked to wait for him in his tent and, struggling to curb his dark thoughts and fight the ongoing withdrawal from the tienelle's toxins, he resorts to the solace of playing Halliron’s lyrante.\n\nHalliron overhears, and is furious: *“Did you lack the guts not to speak to me beforehand?”* Arithon’s apology and promise that he won’t meddle with the lyranthe only inflame Halliron’s wrath. He is not angry because the prince had touched his lyranthe but because he has hidden a rare talent for music. *“I say it here, you’ve no right to see that strangled.”“My sword, you’ll recall, is now wedded to the cause of a kingdom.”* **– Note the confirmation that Arithon has already surrendered his personal preference.** *“if, if, if!”* The choice was never his. Or so he believes.\n\nWith little time left before the tienelle withdrawal will drive him unconscious, Arithon meets Steiven and Caolle and straight out orders them to change tactics. He drops the act of *“womanish daydreamer”* act and forces full disclosure of the mage and shadow master kept hidden. He warns of the peril to the women, proven out by his scrying and demands to take an active part in the battle. He manages to outline his revised strategy before Steiven is called to attend to Jieret who has been overcome by his inherited gift of foresight, and beheld the same vision of slaughter witnessed by Arithon. Twice warned, Steiven and Caolle decide to follow Arithon’s change of tactics.\n\nBut the small victory comes at a cost: even Caolle has been forced to recognize with Arithon's true mettle. Although he succumbed to the tienelle poisoning, the collapse had not been due to weakness. The strength and determination demonstrated through their prince's recovery forever shreds image of the *“useless dreamer”* beyond salvage.\n\n**Incarceration**\n\nAsandir, Kharadmon and the Mad Prophet scale Rockfell Peak and imprison the flask containing Desh-thiere deep within the mountain.\n\nA seemingly insignificant conversation over the 'dangers' (are they real?) of climbing the peak evolve into deeper matters:**Take note of Dakar’s outspoken resentment at the mages for sacrificing Lysaer, whom he considered a friend:** ***“you used a good man and then broke him.”***\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here, when Kharadmon's silence on the subject provokes Dakar to pry, *\"You don't agree.\"*Kharadmon responds obliquely, and the question he asks broaches a MAJOR clue to the Fellowship's moral stance: *\"You have seen how Asandir take deer for the supper pot.\"*And Dakar's peevish, but truthful response: *\"he never hunts anything I ever saw....Asandir just goes out and sits in a thicket somewhere. Eventually a buck happens along, lies down, and dies for him.\"*Kharadmon's truthful clarification opens up a lot of insight for later: *\"HE PROJECTS HIS NEED ANS ASKS. The deer chooses FREELY and its fate and man's hunger end in BALANCE.\"*As the conversation swings back to Lysaer's apparent 'betrayal' **Kharadmon’s clarification is deeply significant.** *“Your prince answered circumstance according to his innate character. The Fellowship imposed nothing outside his natural will and intentions.”* And concerning Desh-thiere's bid for coercion: *“Where opening did not already exist, the creature could not have gained foothold.”“But Sethvir as much as admitted the s’Illesid inborn gift was at fault. Had Lysaer not been driven to seek perfect justice, the wraith would have found nothing to exploit.”“If so, our Fellowship has a reckoning to answer for.”* **– Were the Fellowship wrong? Did they err this gravely?** Kharadmon states: *“We are permitted our mistakes…\"* How far have events gone astray? Or have they not gone astray at all, is there a greater balance in play, and if so, is it, or isn't it jeopardized? HOW FAR DO THE FELLOWSHIP SEE?\n\nThe subchapter progresses into the sequence of unlocking the defenses that secure Rocfell's wardings. The reader is shown all of this through Dakar's observation: mostly in external detail....what you see here as surface description - far more is going on, and expect that the series will, in due time, delve down into the layers later on, and you will grasp, in full measure, on all levels, exactly what is happening. The magic shown here is not 'handwavy' but actually founded on an extrapolation based upon resonant physics.Note at the finish how restless Desh-thiere’s wraiths are within their confinement, *”awaiting the vengeance curse laid on two half-brothers to burgeon into bloodshed and war.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Warning**\n\nUnsettled since the character scrying, Elaira is determined to redress her wrong, since her vision, allowed the Prime Circle the opening to pursue Arithon’s fate. His moves are to be exhaustively tracked, with Koriani policy primed to disadvantage him wherever he can be hampered. Heartsore and unwiling to let that happen, she means to send warning to Sethvir, that Arithon can be protected. The act would be a direct betrayal to her Order, but Elaira resolves to risk the dire consequences.\n\nWe learn that she was taken into service to the Koriani as a condemned street child at the age of six, sworn under vows sealed to flesh and permanently recorded by a Koriani focus crystal that gave bound over her free will over into Morriel’s control. Regrets were useless as, Elaira believes her straits as a sisterhood initiate are powerless to revoke. She insists on the subtlety, the Prime may command her obedience, but doesn’t own her in spirit. This narrow grasp of true nature bases her decision to challenge the Order.\n\nExcept, she is stopped from following through by Traithe, who waylays her where she aimed to perform the scrying. He offers comfort and eases her doubts, saying the Fellowship is fully aware of Morriel’s obstruction. Further, he advises her to trust Arithon to guard himself against the Prime’s interventions. He relates what happened the first time, when Morriel breached Kieling’s wards through the use of Elaira’s private feelings and describes Arithon’s vicious outrage, and his emphatic counter response.\n\nArithon is aware Elaira is being treated as a game piece and Traithe ensures that Elaira knows this More, he reveals that Arithon means to defend her: that she is neither alone, nor Morriel’s plaything\n\n**What happens between the lines, here, is significant.** We already know that the Fellowship will not reveal answers UNLESS THEY ARE ASKED. Is Traithe angling for her to think deeper, here; and if so, is she trapped by her own emotional turmoil when she falls back on the trouble she fell into by visiting Erdane?Why does he rebuke her, for entangling herself in the past, *\"Never sell yourself so short!\"*\n\nBut if there was an opportunity, it is past. His next line offers what soothing encouragement, and a quittance her limited thinking can accept.*“Lady, great heart. .. The love within you is no shame.”*The fact he does not discourage her interaction redoubles the meaning behind the warning Traithe grants to Elaira before departing: *“… for good or ill, you’re the one spirit alive in this world who will come to know Arithon best. Should your Master of Shadow fail you, or you fail him, the outcome will call down disaster.”***Hold this line in mind, it will loom large throughout the entire series.**\n\n*“And if neither of us fails?”“Ah, lady, we’ve been entrusted with this world and free will, which certainly cancels guarantees.”* **– If this line is coupled with Kharadmon's lighter conversation (not so light, really) with Dakar concerning a balance based on free will, true autonomy means that nothing is set in stone and no assumption should be taken as given! For the Fellowship, given the foundation of their moral creed (formally called The Law of the Major Balance), the future holds no guarantees!**\n\n**Eventide**\n\nLysaer and Diegan decide upon following through with Pesquil’s plan, following the initial battle with destroying the viability of the clan encampments By killing the game and poisoning the springs, they will starve out the survivors and ensure will be no next generation…\n\nThe clans under Steiven s’Valerient’s command get ready for battle while Halliron Masterbard plays ballads to inspire them to a valour he grieves will be futile…\n\nSethvir bends his regards to Rockefell Peak to check the wards for Desh-thiere’s prison and detects no flaws. Though Arithon would be able to unravel them if he built on his training, he is least likely to meddle in foolishness. Therefore, the sorcerer is at ease…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat would be all for today's chapters. But if I missed anything, please let me know. :)\n\nI'm looking forward to your comments, as well as the next chapters in our read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A note of warning: The next two chapters have some really brutal content.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**To see the schedule of this read-along click** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/qoqeln/curse_of_the_mistwraith_readalong_schedule_what/)**.**",

Nymphs are female humanoids who reproduce by sleeping with human or elven men or mutating female children using substances such as the Water of Brokilon.\n\n1. Did nymphs begin as a separate race or are they just mutated humans and elves?\n\n2. Did nymphs precede the arrival of elves and humans and if so how did they reproduce? \n\nIn Blood of Elves, Yarpen refers to nymphs as having always been savages; this is used in the wiki to support the idea that nymphs preceded the arrival of the Elder Races, but it doesn’t seem to strictly imply it.",

        "body": "I definitely don't think his wish directly relates to Yennefer like forcing a relationship between them because that gets into kinda uncomfortable territory.\n\nIt would make such sense if it was something abstract, yet simple, such as \"I wish for something more\" (which is coincidentally also what Yen seeks in this episode). That's a desire that's been floating around in his mind clearly since 1x3 and which Triss already noted, and the whole plot of 1x5 is borne out of Geralt's desperation to find something that would let him sleep at night. Something more out of life than just monsters and money. A family would fit the bill.\n\nThis wish would simultaneously explain why the djinn spares Yennefer and why the three of them are drawn irresistably towards one another (without just handwawing it away as \"Destiny did it\"), tie beautifully to the beloved \"Something More\" short story and even make in-series sense of the episode title \"Much More\".\n\nWhat do you think?",
